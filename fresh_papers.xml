Building on disentangled NeuralRadiance Field (NeRF) representations, our approach learns to map BidirectionalReflectance Distribution Functions (BRDF) from pairs of scenes observed invarying conditions, such as dry and wet. The learned transformations can thenbe applied to unseen scenes with similar materials, therefore effectivelyrendering the transformation learned with an arbitrary level of intensity.Extensive experiments on synthetic scenes and real-world objects validate theeffectiveness of our approach, showing that it can learn varioustransformations such as wetness, painting, coating, etc. Our results highlightnot only the versatility of our method but also its potential for practicalapplications in computer graphics.

While Large Language Models(LLMs) have shown impressive performance in solving mathematical problems,existing benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH present limitations, includingnarrow problem definitions with specific numbers and reliance on predeterminedrules that hinder accurate assessments of reasoning and adaptability. Thispaper introduces the UTMath Benchmark, which robustly evaluates the modelsthrough extensive unit tests. It consists of 1,053 problems across 9mathematical domains, with over 68 test cases per problem.We propose aninnovative evaluation framework inspired by unit testing in softwaredevelopment, focusing on both accuracy and reliability of results. Furthermore,we introduce the Reasoning-to-Coding of Thoughts (RCoT) approach, whichencourages LLMs to perform explicit reasoning before generating code, leadingto generating more advanced solution and improved performance. Furthermore, weare releasing not only the UTMath benchmark but also the UTMath-Train trainingdataset (more than 70k samples), to support the community in further exploringmathematical reasoning.</description><author>Bo Yang, Qingping Yang, Runtao Liu</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:59:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07240v1</guid></item><item><title>DeepONet as a Multi-Operator Extrapolation Model: Distributed Pretraining with Physics-Informed Fine-Tuning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07239v1</link><description>We propose a novel fine-tuning method to achieve multi-operator learningthrough training a distributed neural operator with diverse function data andthen zero-shot fine-tuning the neural network using physics-informed losses fordownstream tasks. Operator learning effectively approximates solution operatorsfor PDEs and various PDE-related problems, yet it often struggles to generalizeto new tasks. To address this, we investigate fine-tuning a pretrained model,while carefully selecting an initialization that enables rapid adaptation tonew tasks with minimal data. Our approach combines distributed learning tointegrate data from various operators in pre-training, while physics-informedmethods enable zero-shot fine-tuning, minimizing the reliance on downstreamdata. We investigate standard fine-tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning,applying both to train complex nonlinear target operators that are difficult tolearn only using random initialization. Through comprehensive numericalexamples, we demonstrate the advantages of our approach, showcasing significantimprovements in accuracy. Our findings provide a robust framework for advancingmulti-operator learning and highlight the potential of transfer learningtechniques in this domain.</description><author>Zecheng Zhang, Christian Moya, Lu Lu, Guang Lin, Hayden Schaeffer</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:58:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07239v1</guid></item><item><title>OpenThaiGPT 1.5: A Thai-Centric Open Source Large Language Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07238v1</link><description>OpenThaiGPT 1.5 is an advanced Thai language chat model based on Qwen v2.5,finetuned on over 2,000,000 Thai instruction pairs.

For instance, a good response to a subjective query like "What bookshould I read next?" would depend on the user's preferences, and a goodresponse to an open-ended query like "How do antibiotics work againstbacteria?" would depend on the user's expertise. This makes evaluation ofresponses to such queries an ill-posed task, as evaluators may make arbitraryjudgments about the response quality. To remedy this, we present contextualizedevaluations, a protocol that synthetically constructs context surrounding anunderspecified query and provides it during evaluation. We find that thepresence of context can 1) alter conclusions drawn from evaluation, evenflipping win rates between model pairs, 2) nudge evaluators to make fewerjudgments based on surface-level criteria, like style, and 3) provide newinsights about model behavior across diverse contexts. Specifically, ourprocedure uncovers an implicit bias towards WEIRD contexts in models' "default"responses and we find that models are not equally sensitive to followingdifferent contexts, even when they are provided in prompts.</description><author>Chaitanya Malaviya, Joseph Chee Chang, Dan Roth, Mohit Iyyer, Mark Yatskar, Kyle Lo</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:58:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07237v1</guid></item><item><title>Score-based generative diffusion with "active" correlated noise sources</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07233v1</link><description>Diffusion models exhibit robust generative properties by approximating theunderlying distribution of a dataset and synthesizing data by sampling from theapproximated distribution.

Despiteextensive efforts, existing models often struggle with this balance,particularly with finding a natural location for adding an object in complexscenes. We introduce Add-it, a training-free approach that extends diffusionmodels' attention mechanisms to incorporate information from three key sources:the scene image, the text prompt, and the generated image itself. Our weightedextended-attention mechanism maintains structural consistency and fine detailswhile ensuring natural object placement. Without task-specific fine-tuning,Add-it achieves state-of-the-art results on both real and generated imageinsertion benchmarks, including our newly constructed "Additing AffordanceBenchmark" for evaluating object placement plausibility, outperformingsupervised methods. Human evaluations show that Add-it is preferred in over 80%of cases, and it also demonstrates improvements in various automated metrics.</description><author>Yoad Tewel, Rinon Gal, Dvir Samuel Yuval Atzmon, Lior Wolf, Gal Chechik</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:50:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07232v1</guid></item><item><title>Watermark Anything with Localized Messages</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07231v1</link><description>Image watermarking methods are not tailored to handle small watermarkedareas. This restricts applications in real-world scenarios where parts of theimage may come from different sources or have been edited. We introduce adeep-learning model for localized image watermarking, dubbed the WatermarkAnything Model (WAM). The WAM embedder imperceptibly modifies the input image,while the extractor segments the received image into watermarked andnon-watermarked areas and recovers one or several hidden messages from theareas found to be watermarked. The models are jointly trained at low resolutionand without perceptual constraints, then post-trained for imperceptibility andmultiple watermarks. Experiments show that WAM is competitive with state-of-theart methods in terms of imperceptibility and robustness, especially againstinpainting and splicing, even on high-resolution images. Moreover, it offersnew capabilities: WAM can locate watermarked areas in spliced images andextract distinct 32-bit messages with less than 1 bit error from multiple smallregions - no larger than 10% of the image surface - even for small $256\times256$ images.</description><author>Tom Sander, Pierre Fernandez, Alain Durmus, Teddy Furon, Matthijs Douze</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:49:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07231v1</guid></item><item><title>INQUIRE: A Natural World Text-to-Image Retrieval Benchmark</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02537v3</link><description>We introduce INQUIRE, a text-to-image retrieval benchmark designed tochallenge multimodal vision-language models on expert-level queries. INQUIREincludes iNaturalist 2024 (iNat24), a new dataset of five million natural worldimages, along with 250 expert-level retrieval queries. These queries are pairedwith all relevant images comprehensively labeled within iNat24, comprising33,000 total matches. Queries span categories such as species identification,context, behavior, and appearance, emphasizing tasks that require nuanced imageunderstanding and domain expertise. Our benchmark evaluates two core retrievaltasks: (1) INQUIRE-Fullrank, a full dataset ranking task, and (2)INQUIRE-Rerank, a reranking task for refining top-100 retrievals. Detailedevaluation of a range of recent multimodal models demonstrates that INQUIREposes a significant challenge, with the best models failing to achieve anmAP@50 above 50%. In addition, we show that reranking with more powerfulmultimodal models can enhance retrieval performance, yet there remains asignificant margin for improvement. By focusing on scientifically-motivatedecological challenges, INQUIRE aims to bridge the gap between AI capabilitiesand the needs of real-world scientific inquiry, encouraging the development ofretrieval systems that can assist with accelerating ecological and biodiversityresearch.

This curation process is often expensive andrequires throwing away precious annotated data to balance the frequency acrossclasses. This is because the distribution of data in the world (e.g., internet,etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is oftenover-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed forwell-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfectdatasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep modelsto be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developingrobust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution isnecessary. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep NeuralNetworks that can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the realworld. These works are divided into four segments, each covering a scenario oflearning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the works focuses onLearning Generative Models for Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate themode-collapse for tail (minority) classes and enable diverse aesthetic imagegenerations as head (majority) classes. In the second part, we enable effectivegeneralization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, whichallow tail classes to generalize as the head classes without enforcing explicitgeneration of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for OptimizingRelevant Metrics compared to the average accuracy for learning from long-taileddata with limited annotation (semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part,which focuses on the effective domain adaptation of the model to variousdomains with zero to very few labeled samples.</description><author>Harsh Rangwani</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:48:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07229v1</guid></item><item><title>Tooling or Not Tooling? The Impact of Tools on Language Agents for Chemistry Problem Solving</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07228v1</link><description>To enhance large language models (LLMs) for chemistry problem solving,several LLM-based agents augmented with tools have been proposed, such asChemCrow and Coscientist. However, their evaluations are narrow in scope,leaving a large gap in understanding the benefits of tools across diversechemistry tasks. To bridge this gap, we develop ChemAgent, an enhancedchemistry agent over ChemCrow, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of itsperformance on both specialized chemistry tasks and general chemistryquestions. Surprisingly, ChemAgent does not consistently outperform its baseLLMs without tools. Our error analysis with a chemistry expert suggests that:For specialized chemistry tasks, such as synthesis prediction, we shouldaugment agents with specialized tools; however, for general chemistry questionslike those in exams, agents' ability to reason correctly with chemistryknowledge matters more, and tool augmentation does not always help.</description><author>Botao Yu, Frazier N.

This study highlights a major, yet so faroverlooked opportunity for substantially improving tabular MLPs: namely,parameter-efficient ensembling -- a paradigm for implementing an ensemble ofmodels as one model producing multiple predictions. We start by developing TabM-- a simple model based on MLP and our variations of BatchEnsemble (an existingtechnique). Then, we perform a large-scale evaluation of tabular DLarchitectures on public benchmarks in terms of both task performance andefficiency, which renders the landscape of tabular DL in a new light.Generally, we show that MLPs, including TabM, form a line of stronger and morepractical models compared to attention- and retrieval-based architectures. Inparticular, we find that TabM demonstrates the best performance among tabularDL models. Lastly, we conduct an empirical analysis on the ensemble-like natureof TabM. For example, we observe that the multiple predictions of TabM are weakindividually, but powerful collectively. Overall, our work brings an impactfultechnique to tabular DL, analyses its behaviour, and advances theperformance-efficiency trade-off with TabM -- a simple and powerful baselinefor researchers and practitioners.</description><author>Yury Gorishniy, Akim Kotelnikov, Artem Babenko</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:46:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24210v2</guid></item><item><title>TempCharBERT: Keystroke Dynamics for Continuous Access Control Based on Pre-trained Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07224v1</link><description>With the widespread of digital environments, reliable authentication andcontinuous access control has become crucial. It can minimize cyber attacks andprevent frauds, specially those associated with identity theft. A particularinterest lies on keystroke dynamics (KD), which refers to the task ofrecognizing individuals' identity based on their unique typing style. In thiswork, we propose the use of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to recognizesuch patterns. Although PLMs have shown high performance on multiple NLPbenchmarks, the use of these models on specific tasks requires customization.BERT and RoBERTa, for instance, rely on subword tokenization, and they cannotbe directly applied to KD, which requires temporal-character information torecognize users. Recent character-aware PLMs are able to process both subwordsand character-level information and can be an alternative solution.Notwithstanding, they are still not suitable to be directly fine-tuned for KDas they are not optimized to account for user's temporal typing information(e.g., hold time and flight time). To overcome this limitation, we proposeTempCharBERT, an architecture that incorporates temporal-character informationin the embedding layer of CharBERT. This allows modeling keystroke dynamics forthe purpose of user identification and authentication. Our results show asignificant improvement with this customization. We also showed the feasibilityof training TempCharBERT on a federated learning settings in order to fosterdata privacy.</description><author>Matheus Simão, Fabiano Prado, Omar Abdul Wahab, Anderson Avila</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:44:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07224v1</guid></item><item><title>Grounding Video Models to Actions through Goal Conditioned Exploration</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07223v1</link><description>Large video models, pretrained on massive amounts of Internet video, providea rich source of physical knowledge about the dynamics and motions of objectsand tasks. However, video models are not grounded in the embodiment of anagent, and do not describe how to actuate the world to reach the visual statesdepicted in a video. To tackle this problem, current methods use a separatevision-based inverse dynamic model trained on embodiment-specific data to mapimage states to actions. Gathering data to train such a model is oftenexpensive and challenging, and this model is limited to visual settings similarto the ones in which data are available. In this paper, we investigate how todirectly ground video models to continuous actions through self-exploration inthe embodied environment -- using generated video states as visual goals forexploration. We propose a framework that uses trajectory level actiongeneration in combination with video guidance to enable an agent to solvecomplex tasks without any external supervision, e.g., rewards, action labels,or segmentation masks. We validate the proposed approach on 8 tasks in Libero,6 tasks in MetaWorld, 4 tasks in Calvin, and 12 tasks in iThor VisualNavigation. We show how our approach is on par with or even surpasses multiplebehavior cloning baselines trained on expert demonstrations while withoutrequiring any action annotations.</description><author>Yunhao Luo, Yilun Du</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:43:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07223v1</guid></item><item><title>Nteasee: A mixed methods study of expert and general population perspectives on deploying AI for health in African countries</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12197v3</link><description>Artificial Intelligence (AI) for health has the potential to significantlychange and improve healthcare. However in most African countries, identifyingculturally and contextually attuned approaches for deploying these solutions isnot well understood. To bridge this gap, we conduct a qualitative study toinvestigate the best practices, fairness indicators, and potential biases tomitigate when deploying AI for health in African countries, as well as exploreopportunities where artificial intelligence could make a positive impact inhealth. We used a mixed methods approach combining in-depth interviews (IDIs)and surveys. We conduct 1.5-2 hour long IDIs with 50 experts in health, policy,and AI across 17 countries, and through an inductive approach we conduct aqualitative thematic analysis on expert IDI responses. We administer a blinded30-minute survey with case studies to 672 general population participantsacross 5 countries in Africa and analyze responses on quantitative scales,statistically comparing responses by country, age, gender, and level offamiliarity with AI. We thematically summarize open-ended responses fromsurveys. Our results find generally positive attitudes, high levels of trust,accompanied by moderate levels of concern among general population participantsfor AI usage for health in Africa. This contrasts with expert responses, wheremajor themes revolved around trust/mistrust, ethical concerns, and systemicbarriers to integration, among others. This work presents the first-of-its-kindqualitative research study of the potential of AI for health in Africa from analgorithmic fairness angle, with perspectives from both experts and the generalpopulation. We hope that this work guides policymakers and drives home the needfor further research and the inclusion of general population perspectives indecision-making around AI usage.</description><author>Mercy Nyamewaa Asiedu, Iskandar Haykel, Awa Dieng, Kerrie Kauer, Tousif Ahmed, Florence Ofori, Charisma Chan, Stephen Pfohl, Negar Rostamzadeh, Katherine Heller</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:42:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12197v3</guid></item><item><title>Content-Style Learning from Unaligned Domains: Identifiability under Unknown Latent Dimensions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03755v2</link><description>Understanding identifiability of latent content and style variables fromunaligned multi-domain data is essential for tasks such as domain translationand data generation. Existing works on content-style identification were oftendeveloped under somewhat stringent conditions, e.g., that all latent componentsare mutually independent and that the dimensions of the content and stylevariables are known. We introduce a new analytical framework via cross-domain\textit{latent distribution matching} (LDM), which establishes content-styleidentifiability under substantially more relaxed conditions. Specifically, weshow that restrictive assumptions such as component-wise independence of thelatent variables can be removed. Most notably, we prove that prior knowledge ofthe content and style dimensions is not necessary for ensuring identifiability,if sparsity constraints are properly imposed onto the learned latentrepresentations. Bypassing the knowledge of the exact latent dimension has beena longstanding aspiration in unsupervised representation learning -- ouranalysis is the first to underpin its theoretical and practical viability. Onthe implementation side, we recast the LDM formulation into a regularizedmulti-domain GAN loss with coupled latent variables. We show that thereformulation is equivalent to LDM under mild conditions -- yet requiringconsiderably less computational resource. Experiments corroborate with ourtheoretical claims.</description><author>Sagar Shrestha, Xiao Fu</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:40:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03755v2</guid></item><item><title>TreeCoders: Trees of Transformers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07218v1</link><description>In this paper, we introduce TreeCoders, a novel family of transformer trees.We moved away from traditional linear transformers to complete k-ary trees.Transformer blocks serve as nodes, and generic classifiers learn to select thebest child and route the sequence of tokens to a specific leaf. The selectors,moved outside the transformer blocks, allow for the use of a variety ofarchitecture without further modifications. Furthermore, our proposedarchitecture supports sparse node activation due to the logarithmic complexityof a tree search. We validate our idea by testing a series of decoder-only treetransformers, achieving competitive results across a diverse range of languagedatasets. Our study demonstrates that the proposed tree transformer modeloutperforms a size-equivalent linear transformer model 76\% of the time over awide range of tree architectures.

Bayesian approaches to the problemare the gold standard as they allow for the quantification of uncertainties andenable the seamless fusion of different experimental modalities. When thedynamics are discrete and stochastic, one may employ powerful techniques suchas Kalman, particle, or variational filters. Practitioners commonly apply thesemethods to continuous-time, deterministic dynamical systems after discretizingthe dynamics and introducing fictitious transition probabilities. However,approaches based on time-discretization suffer from the curse of dimensionalitysince the number of random variables grows linearly with the number oftime-steps. Furthermore, the introduction of fictitious transitionprobabilities is an unsatisfactory solution because it increases the number ofmodel parameters and may lead to inference bias. To address these drawbacks,the objective of this paper is to develop a scalable Bayesian approach to stateand parameter estimation suitable for continuous-time, deterministic dynamicalsystems. Our methodology builds upon information field theory. Specifically, weconstruct a physics-informed prior probability measure on the function space ofsystem responses so that functions that satisfy the physics are more likely.This prior allows us to quantify model form errors. We connect the system'sresponse to observations through a probabilistic model of the measurementprocess. The joint posterior over the system responses and all parameters isgiven by Bayes' rule. To approximate the intractable posterior, we develop astochastic variational inference algorithm. In summary, the developedmethodology offers a powerful framework for Bayesian estimation in dynamicalsystems.</description><author>Kairui Hao, Ilias Bilionis</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:38:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02150v2</guid></item><item><title>Feature Selection Based on Wasserstein Distance</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07217v1</link><description>In this paper, we present a novel feature selection method based on theWasserstein distance.

The standard random baseline--the expected accuracy ofguessing labels uniformly at random--is stable when the evaluation set is usedonly once or when the dataset is large. We account for the common practice ofvalidation set reuse and existing small datasets with a stronger randombaseline: the expected maximum accuracy across multiple random classifiers.When choosing the best prompt demonstrations across six quantized languagemodels applied to 16 BIG-bench Lite tasks, more than 20% of the few-shotresults that exceed the standard baseline do not exceed this stronger randombaseline. When held-out test sets are available, this stronger baseline is alsoa better predictor of held-out performance than the standard baseline, avoidingunnecessary test set evaluations. This maximum random baseline provides aneasily calculated drop-in replacement for the standard baseline.</description><author>Gregory Yauney, David Mimno</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:37:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13020v2</guid></item><item><title>Comparing Bottom-Up and Top-Down Steering Approaches on In-Context Learning Tasks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07213v1</link><description>A key objective of interpretability research on large language models (LLMs)is to develop methods for robustly steering models toward desired behaviors. Tothis end, two distinct approaches to interpretability -- ``bottom-up" and``top-down" -- have been presented, but there has been little quantitativecomparison between them. We present a case study comparing the effectiveness ofrepresentative vector steering methods from each branch: function vectors (FV;arXiv:2310.15213), as a bottom-up method, and in-context vectors (ICV;arXiv:2311.06668) as a top-down method. While both aim to capture compactrepresentations of broad in-context learning tasks, we find they are effectiveonly on specific types of tasks: ICVs outperform FVs in behavioral shifting,whereas FVs excel in tasks requiring more precision.

Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entaildeveloping manually curated, task-specific features and models to representhuman behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challengingto adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce aPopulation Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture therelationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broadrange of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postalcodes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregatedinformation on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated searchtrends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We thenmodel this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graphneural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range ofdownstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectivenessof our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning threedistinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmentalmeasurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation andsuper-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-artforecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty,achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting. The full setof embeddings and sample code are publicly available for researchers.</description><author>Mohit Agarwal, Mimi Sun, Chaitanya Kamath, Arbaaz Muslim, Prithul Sarker, Joydeep Paul, Hector Yee, Marcin Sieniek, Kim Jablonski, Yael Mayer, David Fork, Sheila de Guia, Jamie McPike, Adam Boulanger, Tomer Shekel, David Schottlander, Yao Xiao, Manjit Chakravarthy Manukonda, Yun Liu, Neslihan Bulut, Sami Abu-el-haija, Arno Eigenwillig, Parth Kothari, Bryan Perozzi, Monica Bharel, Von Nguyen, Luke Barrington, Niv Efron, Yossi Matias, Greg Corrado, Krish Eswaran, Shruthi Prabhakara, Shravya Shetty, Gautam Prasad</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:32:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07207v1</guid></item><item><title>Scaling Law Hypothesis for Multimodal Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06754v4</link><description>We propose a scaling law hypothesis for multimodal models processing text,audio, images, and video within a shared token and embedding space.

While this generative data expansion maysuffice for easier visual tasks, we explore its efficacy on a more difficultdiscriminative task: clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID).CC-ReID aims to match people appearing in non-overlapping cameras, even whenthey change their clothes across cameras. Not only are current CC-ReID modelsconstrained by the limited diversity of clothing in current CC-ReID datasets,but generating additional data that retains important personal features foraccurate identification is a current challenge. To address this issue wepropose DLCR, a novel data expansion framework that leverages pre-traineddiffusion and large language models (LLMs) to accurately generate diverseimages of individuals in varied attire. We generate additional data for fivebenchmark CC-ReID datasets (PRCC, CCVID, LaST, VC-Clothes, and LTCC) and\textbf{increase their clothing diversity by \boldmath{$10$}x, totaling over\boldmath{$2.1$}M images generated}. DLCR employs diffusion-based text-guidedinpainting, conditioned on clothing prompts constructed using LLMs, to generatesynthetic data that only modifies a subject's clothes while preserving theirpersonally identifiable features. With this massive increase in data, weintroduce two novel strategies - progressive learning and test-time predictionrefinement - that respectively reduce training time and further boosts CC-ReIDperformance. On the PRCC dataset, we obtain a large top-1 accuracy improvementof $11.3\%$ by training CAL, a previous state of the art (SOTA) method, withDLCR-generated data.

Recently, numerous fake news detectionmodels that utilize textual information and the propagation structure of postshave been proposed.

To address this, weintroduce \textbf{F}uture \textbf{AD}aptive \textbf{E}vent-based Fake newsDetection (FADE) framework. Specifically, we train a target predictor throughan adaptive augmentation strategy and graph contrastive learning to obtainhigher-quality features and make more accurate overall predictions.Simultaneously, we independently train an event-only predictor to obtain biasedpredictions. We further mitigate event bias by subtracting the event-onlypredictor's output from the target predictor's output to obtain the finalprediction.

A prominent engineering challenge revolves around programming thecollective adaptive behaviour of such computational ecosystems. This requiresabstractions able to capture concepts like ensembles (dynamic groups ofcooperating devices) and collective tasks (joint activities carried out byensembles). In this work, we consider collections of devices interacting withneighbours and that execute in nearly-synchronised sense-compute-interactrounds, where the computation is given by a single program mapping sensingvalues and incoming messages to output and outcoming messages. To supportprogramming whole computational collectives, we propose the abstraction of adistributed collective process, which can be used to define at once theensemble formation logic and its collective task. We formalise the abstractionin the eXchange Calculus (XC), a core functional language based on neighbouringvalues (maps from neighbours to values) where state and interaction is handledthrough a single primitive, exchange, and provide a correspondingimplementation in the FCPP language. Then, we exercise distributed collectiveprocesses using two case studies: multi-hop message propagation and distributedmonitoring of spatial properties. Finally, we discuss the features of theabstraction and its suitability for different kinds of distributed computingapplications.</description><author>Giorgio Audrito, Roberto Casadei, Ferruccio Damiani, Gianluca Torta, Mirko Viroli</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:26:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11212v2</guid></item><item><title>'Explaining RL Decisions with Trajectories': A Reproducibility Study</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07200v1</link><description>This work investigates the reproducibility of the paper 'Explaining RLdecisions with trajectories'.

However, these methods remain far frompractical, real-life applications. We identify three primary challengescontributing to this gap. Firstly, existing models have limited editing skillsdue to the biased synthesis process. Secondly, these methods are trained withdatasets with a high volume of noise and artifacts. This is due to theapplication of simple filtering methods like CLIP-score. Thirdly, all thesedatasets are restricted to a single low resolution and fixed aspect ratio,limiting the versatility to handle real-world use cases. In this paper, wepresent \omniedit, which is an omnipotent editor to handle seven differentimage editing tasks with any aspect ratio seamlessly. Our contribution is infour folds: (1) \omniedit is trained by utilizing the supervision from sevendifferent specialist models to ensure task coverage. (2) we utilize importancesampling based on the scores provided by large multimodal models (like GPT-4o)instead of CLIP-score to improve the data quality. (3) we propose a new editingarchitecture called EditNet to greatly boost the editing success rate, (4) weprovide images with different aspect ratios to ensure that our model can handleany image in the wild. We have curated a test set containing images ofdifferent aspect ratios, accompanied by diverse instructions to cover differenttasks. Both automatic evaluation and human evaluations demonstrate that\omniedit can significantly outperform all the existing models.

It seems appealing togovern robots solely based on data, bypassing the traditional, more elaboratepipeline of system modeling through first-principles and subsequent controllerdesign. One promising data-driven approach is the Extended Dynamic ModeDecomposition (EDMD) for control-affine systems, a system class which containsmany vehicles and machines of immense practical importance including, e.g.,typical wheeled mobile robots. EDMD can be highly data-efficient,computationally inexpensive, can deal with nonlinear dynamics as prevalent inrobotics and mechanics, and has a sound theoretical foundation rooted inKoopman theory. On this background, this present paper examines how EDMD modelscan be integrated into predictive controllers for nonholonomic mobile robots.In addition to the conventional kinematic mobile robot, we also cover thecomplete data-driven control pipeline - from data acquisition to control design- when the robot is not treated in terms of first-order kinematics but in asecond-order manner, allowing to account for actuator dynamics. Using onlyreal-world measurement data, it is shown in both simulations and hardwareexperiments that the surrogate models enable high-precision predictivecontrollers in the studied cases. However, the findings raise significantconcerns about purely data-centric approaches that overlook the underlyinggeometry of nonholonomic systems, showing that, for nonholonomic systems, somegeometric insight seems necessary and cannot be easily compensated for withlarge amounts of data.</description><author>Mario Rosenfelder, Lea Bold, Hannes Eschmann, Peter Eberhard, Karl Worthmann, Henrik Ebel</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:08:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07192v1</guid></item><item><title>Diffusion Models for Audio Restoration</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09821v3</link><description>With the development of audio playback devices and fast data transmission,the demand for high sound quality is rising for both entertainment andcommunications. In this quest for better sound quality, challenges emerge fromdistortions and interferences originating at the recording side or caused by animperfect transmission pipeline. To address this problem, audio restorationmethods aim to recover clean sound signals from the corrupted input data. Wepresent here audio restoration algorithms based on diffusion models, with afocus on speech enhancement and music restoration tasks. Traditionalapproaches, often grounded in handcrafted rules and statistical heuristics,have shaped our understanding of audio signals. In the past decades, there hasbeen a notable shift towards data-driven methods that exploit the modelingcapabilities of DNNs. Deep generative models, and among them diffusion models,have emerged as powerful techniques for learning complex data distributions.However, relying solely on DNN-based learning approaches carries the risk ofreducing interpretability, particularly when employing end-to-end models.Nonetheless, data-driven approaches allow more flexibility in comparison tostatistical model-based frameworks, whose performance depends on distributionaland statistical assumptions that can be difficult to guarantee. Here, we aim toshow that diffusion models can combine the best of both worlds and offer theopportunity to design audio restoration algorithms with a good degree ofinterpretability and a remarkable performance in terms of sound quality. Weexplain the diffusion formalism and its application to the conditionalgeneration of clean audio signals. We believe that diffusion models open anexciting field of research with the potential to spawn new audio restorationalgorithms that are natural-sounding and remain robust in difficult acousticsituations.</description><author>Jean-Marie Lemercier, Julius Richter, Simon Welker, Eloi Moliner, Vesa Välimäki, Timo Gerkmann</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:07:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09821v3</guid></item><item><title>The Super Weight in Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07191v1</link><description>Recent works have shown a surprising result: a small fraction of LargeLanguage Model (LLM) parameter outliers are disproportionately important to thequality of the model. LLMs contain billions of parameters, so these smallfractions, such as 0.01%, translate to hundreds of thousands of parameters. Inthis work, we present an even more surprising finding: Pruning as few as asingle parameter can destroy an LLM's ability to generate text -- increasingperplexity by 3 orders of magnitude and reducing zero-shot accuracy toguessing. We propose a data-free method for identifying such parameters, termedsuper weights, using a single forward pass through the model. We additionallyfind that these super weights induce correspondingly rare and large activationoutliers, termed super activations. When preserved with high precision, superactivations can improve simple round-to-nearest quantization to becomecompetitive with state-of-the-art methods. For weight quantization, wesimilarly find that by preserving the super weight and clipping other weightoutliers, round-to-nearest quantization can scale to much larger block sizesthan previously considered. To facilitate further research into super weights,we provide an index of super weight coordinates for common, openly availableLLMs.</description><author>Mengxia Yu, De Wang, Qi Shan, Colorado Reed, Alvin Wan</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:05:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07191v1</guid></item><item><title>NatureLM-audio: an Audio-Language Foundation Model for Bioacoustics</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07186v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) prompted with text and audio represent the stateof the art in various auditory tasks, including speech, music, and generalaudio, showing emergent abilities on unseen tasks.

Recent methods harness the powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) for2D-to-3D knowledge distillation, achieving zero-shot 3D part segmentation.However, these methods are limited by their reliance on text prompts, whichrestricts the scalability to large-scale unlabeled datasets and the flexibilityin handling part ambiguities. In this work, we introduce SAMPart3D, a scalablezero-shot 3D part segmentation framework that segments any 3D object intosemantic parts at multiple granularities, without requiring predefined partlabel sets as text prompts. For scalability, we use text-agnostic visionfoundation models to distill a 3D feature extraction backbone, allowing scalingto large unlabeled 3D datasets to learn rich 3D priors. For flexibility, wedistill scale-conditioned part-aware 3D features for 3D part segmentation atmultiple granularities. Once the segmented parts are obtained from thescale-conditioned part-aware 3D features, we use VLMs to assign semantic labelsto each part based on the multi-view renderings. Compared to previous methods,our SAMPart3D can scale to the recent large-scale 3D object dataset Objaverseand handle complex, non-ordinary objects. Additionally, we contribute a new 3Dpart segmentation benchmark to address the lack of diversity and complexity ofobjects and parts in existing benchmarks.

However, standard FL algorithms are iterativeand thus induce a significant communication cost. One-shot federated learning(OFL) trades the iterative exchange of models between clients and the serverwith a single round of communication, thereby saving substantially oncommunication costs. Not surprisingly, OFL exhibits a performance gap in termsof accuracy with respect to FL, especially under high data heterogeneity. Weintroduce FENS, a novel federated ensembling scheme that approaches theaccuracy of FL with the communication efficiency of OFL. Learning in FENSproceeds in two phases: first, clients train models locally and send them tothe server, similar to OFL; second, clients collaboratively train a lightweightprediction aggregator model using FL. We showcase the effectiveness of FENSthrough exhaustive experiments spanning several datasets and heterogeneitylevels. In the particular case of heterogeneously distributed CIFAR-10 dataset,FENS achieves up to a 26.9% higher accuracy over state-of-the-art (SOTA) OFL,being only 3.1% lower than FL. At the same time, FENS incurs at most 4.3x morecommunication than OFL, whereas FL is at least 10.9x morecommunication-intensive than FENS.</description><author>Youssef Allouah, Akash Dhasade, Rachid Guerraoui, Nirupam Gupta, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Rafael Pinot, Rafael Pires, Rishi Sharma</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 17:58:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07182v1</guid></item><item><title>Counterfactual Generation from Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07180v1</link><description>Understanding and manipulating the causal generation mechanisms in languagemodels is essential for controlling their behavior. Previous work has primarilyrelied on techniques such as representation surgery -- e.g., model ablations ormanipulation of linear subspaces tied to specific concepts -- to intervene onthese models. To understand the impact of interventions precisely, it is usefulto examine counterfactuals -- e.g., how a given sentence would have appearedhad it been generated by the model following a specific intervention. Wehighlight that counterfactual reasoning is conceptually distinct frominterventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal hierarchy. Based on thisobservation, we propose a framework for generating true string counterfactualsby reformulating language models as Generalized Structural-equation. Modelsusing the Gumbel-max trick. This allows us to model the joint distribution overoriginal strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the sameinstantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on hindsightGumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables and generatecounterfactuals of observed strings.

Moreover, packettransmission times from the source to the monitor are non-zero which disallowsthe monitor to have perfect information on the actual AoII process at any time.Hence, for this pull-based system, we propose the monitor to maintain asufficient statistic called {\em belief} which stands for the jointdistribution of the age and source processes to be obtained from the history ofall observations. Using belief, we first propose a maximum a posteriori (MAP)estimator to be used at the monitor as opposed to existing martingaleestimators in the literature.

The attention head cansimultaneously delete, copy, or retain tokens by assigning them negative,positive, or minimal attention weights, respectively. As a result, a singleattention head becomes more flexible and expressive. (2) Cog Attention improvesthe model's robustness against representational collapse, which can occur whenearlier tokens are over-squashed into later positions, leading to homogeneousrepresentations. Negative weights reduce effective information paths fromearlier to later tokens, helping to mitigate this issue. We developTransformer-like models which use Cog Attention as attention modules, includingdecoder-only models for language modeling and U-ViT diffusion models for imagegeneration.

We study this fragility in the context ofcontinual memorization, where the model is trained on a small set of long-tailfactoids (factual associations) and must retain these factoids after multiplestages of subsequent training on other datasets. Through extensive experiments,we show that LLMs suffer from forgetting across a wide range of subsequenttasks, and simple replay techniques do not fully prevent forgetting, especiallywhen the factoid datasets are trained in the later stages. We posit that thereare two ways to alleviate forgetting: 1) protect the memorization process asthe model learns the factoids, or 2) reduce interference from training in laterstages. With this insight, we develop an effective mitigation strategy: REMIX(Random and Generic Data Mixing). REMIX prevents forgetting by mixing genericdata sampled from pretraining corpora or even randomly generated word sequencesduring each stage, despite being unrelated to the memorized factoids in thefirst stage. REMIX can recover performance from severe forgetting, oftenoutperforming replay-based methods that have access to the factoids from thefirst stage. We then analyze how REMIX alters the learning process and findthat successful forgetting prevention is associated with a pattern: the modelstores factoids in earlier layers than usual and diversifies the set of layersthat store these factoids. The efficacy of REMIX invites further investigationinto the underlying dynamics of memorization and forgetting, opening excitingpossibilities for future research.</description><author>Howard Chen, Jiayi Geng, Adithya Bhaskar, Dan Friedman, Danqi Chen</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 17:56:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07175v1</guid></item><item><title>Qwen2.5-Coder Technical Report</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12186v2</link><description>In this report, we introduce the Qwen2.5-Coder series, a significant upgradefrom its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5.

Despiterecent progress in this field utilizing deep learning and motion capture data,existing methods are always limited to specific motion categories,environments, and styles. This poor generalizability can be partiallyattributed to the difficulty and expense of collecting large-scale andhigh-quality motion data. At the same time, foundation models trained withinternet-scale image and text data have demonstrated surprising world knowledgeand reasoning ability for various downstream tasks. Utilizing these foundationmodels may help with human motion synthesis, which some recent works havesuperficially explored. However, these methods didn't fully unveil thefoundation models' potential for this task and only support several simpleactions and environments. In this paper, we for the first time, without anymotion data, explore open-set human motion synthesis using natural languageinstructions as user control signals based on MLLMs across any motion task andenvironment. Our framework can be split into two stages: 1) sequential keyframegeneration by utilizing MLLMs as a keyframe designer and animator; 2) motionfilling between keyframes through interpolation and motion tracking. Our methodcan achieve general human motion synthesis for many downstream tasks. Thepromising results demonstrate the worth of mocap-free human motion synthesisaided by MLLMs and pave the way for future research.</description><author>Zhikai Zhang, Yitang Li, Haofeng Huang, Mingxian Lin, Li Yi</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 17:54:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10740v3</guid></item><item><title>Mutual Information Estimation via $f$-Divergence and Data Derangements</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20025v2</link><description>Estimating mutual information accurately is pivotal across diverseapplications, from machine learning to communications and biology, enabling usto gain insights into the inner mechanisms of complex systems. Yet, dealingwith high-dimensional data presents a formidable challenge, due to its size andthe presence of intricate relationships. Recently proposed neural methodsemploying variational lower bounds on the mutual information have gainedprominence. However, these approaches suffer from either high bias or highvariance, as the sample size and the structure of the loss function directlyinfluence the training process. In this paper, we propose a novel class ofdiscriminative mutual information estimators based on the variationalrepresentation of the $f$-divergence. We investigate the impact of thepermutation function used to obtain the marginal training samples and present anovel architectural solution based on derangements. The proposed estimator isflexible since it exhibits an excellent bias/variance trade-off. The comparisonwith state-of-the-art neural estimators, through extensive experimentationwithin established reference scenarios, shows that our approach offers higheraccuracy and lower complexity.</description><author>Nunzio A.

However, in the root node of the search tree, it is moresensible to minimize simple regret. Previous work has proposed using SequentialHalving as selection strategy in the root node, as, in theory, it performsbetter with respect to simple regret. However, Sequential Halving requires abudget of iterations to be predetermined, which is often impractical. Thispaper proposes an anytime version of the algorithm, which can be halted at anyarbitrary time and still return a satisfactory result, while being designedsuch that it approximates the behavior of Sequential Halving. Empirical resultsin synthetic MAB problems and ten different board games demonstrate that thealgorithm's performance is competitive with Sequential Halving and UCB1 (andtheir analogues in MCTS).</description><author>Dominic Sagers, Mark H.

Existing autoencodermodels have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compressionratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy forhigh spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge byintroducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design ourmodels to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features toalleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders;(2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phasestraining strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of highspatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve theautoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining thereconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, weachieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedupon H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widelyused SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder.

Human-curated symbolic knowledge sources, such aslexicons for standard language and slang terms, can potentially elevate socialmedia signals in evolving language. We introduce a neurosymbolic method thatintegrates neural networks with symbolic knowledge sources, enhancing thedetection and interpretation of mental health-related tweets relevant toCOVID-19. Our method was evaluated using a corpus of large datasets(approximately 12 billion tweets, 2.5 million subreddit data, and 700k newsarticles) and multiple knowledge graphs. This method dynamically adapts toevolving language, outperforming purely data-driven models with an F1 scoreexceeding 92\%. This approach also showed faster adaptation to new data andlower computational demands than fine-tuning pre-trained large language models(LLMs).

In this paper, weintroduce customized density ratio (CDR), a training-free and highly effectivemethod that leverages off-the-shelf LLMs for preference data annotation. Ourapproach uses the log-density ratio between a better-aligned LLM and a lessaligned LLM as a reward signal. We explores 221 different LLMs pairs andempirically demonstrate that increasing the performance gap between paired LLMscorrelates with better reward generalization. Furthermore, we show thattailoring the density ratio reward function with specific criteria andpreference exemplars enhances performance across domains and within targetareas. In our experiment using density ratio from a pair of Mistral-7B models, CDRachieves a RewardBench score of 82.6, outperforming the best trained rewardfunctions from same model class and demonstrating competitive performanceagainst SoTA models in Safety (91.0) and Reasoning (88.0) domains. We use CDRto annotate an on-policy preference dataset with which we preference tuneLlama-3-8B-Instruct with SimPO. Using reward signals from two relatively weakmodels, our approach pushes Llama-3-8B to achieve a 37.4% (+15.1%) win rate onArenaHard and a 40.7% (+17.8%) win rate on Length-Controlled AlpacaEval 2.0,along with a score of 8.0 on MT-Bench.</description><author>Guangxuan Xu, Kai Xu, Shivchander Sudalairaj, Hao Wang, Akash Srivastava</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 17:34:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02481v2</guid></item><item><title>A Primer on Word Embeddings: AI Techniques for Text Analysis in Social Work</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07156v1</link><description>Word embeddings represent a transformative technology for analyzing text datain social work research, offering sophisticated tools for understanding casenotes, policy documents, research literature, and other text-based materials.This methodological paper introduces word embeddings to social workresearchers, explaining how these mathematical representations capture meaningand relationships in text data more effectively than traditional keyword-basedapproaches.

To this end, we propose a non-parametricestimator for conditional Brenier maps based on the computational scalabilityof \emph{entropic} optimal transport. Our estimator leverages a result ofCarlier et al.

The resultinginstruction-following capabilities of LLMs heavily rely on the instructiondatasets used for tuning. Recently, synthetic instruction datasets have emergedas an economically viable solution to provide LLMs diverse and high-qualityinstructions. However, existing approaches typically assume that larger orstronger models are stronger teachers for instruction tuning, and hence simplyadopt these models as response generators to the synthetic instructions. Inthis paper, we challenge this commonly-adopted assumption. Our extensiveexperiments across five base models and twenty response generators reveal thatlarger and stronger models are not necessarily stronger teachers of smallermodels. We refer to this phenomenon as the Larger Models' Paradox. We observethat existing metrics cannot precisely predict the effectiveness of responsegenerators since they ignore the compatibility between teachers and base modelsbeing fine-tuned. We thus develop a novel metric, named asCompatibility-Adjusted Reward (CAR) to measure the effectiveness of responsegenerators. Our experiments across five base models demonstrate that CARoutperforms almost all baselines.</description><author>Zhangchen Xu, Fengqing Jiang, Luyao Niu, Bill Yuchen Lin, Radha Poovendran</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 17:06:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07133v1</guid></item><item><title>ActionAtlas: A VideoQA Benchmark for Domain-specialized Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05774v4</link><description>Our world is full of varied actions and moves across specialized domains thatwe, as humans, strive to identify and understand. Within any single domain,actions can often appear quite similar, making it challenging for deep modelsto distinguish them accurately. To evaluate the effectiveness of multimodalfoundation models in helping us recognize such actions, we present ActionAtlasv1.0, a multiple-choice video question answering benchmark featuring shortvideos across various sports. Each video in the dataset is paired with aquestion and four or five choices. The question pinpoints specific individuals,asking which choice "best" describes their action within a certain temporalcontext. Overall, the dataset includes 934 videos showcasing 580 unique actionsacross 56 sports, with a total of 1896 actions within choices. Unlike mostexisting video question answering benchmarks that only cover simplisticactions, often identifiable from a single frame, ActionAtlas focuses onintricate movements and rigorously tests the model's capability to discernsubtle differences between moves that look similar within each domain. Weevaluate open and proprietary foundation models on this benchmark, finding thatthe best model, GPT-4o, achieves a maximum accuracy of 45.52%. Meanwhile,Non-expert crowd workers, provided with action description for each choice,achieve 61.64% accuracy, where random chance is approximately 21%. Our findingswith state-of-the-art models indicate that having a high frame sampling rate isimportant for accurately recognizing actions in ActionAtlas, a feature thatsome leading proprietary video models, such as Gemini, do not include in theirdefault configuration.</description><author>Mohammadreza Salehi, Jae Sung Park, Tanush Yadav, Aditya Kusupati, Ranjay Krishna, Yejin Choi, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Ali Farhadi</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 17:06:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05774v4</guid></item><item><title>Token Merging for Training-Free Semantic Binding in Text-to-Image Synthesis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07132v1</link><description>Although text-to-image (T2I) models exhibit remarkable generationcapabilities, they frequently fail to accurately bind semantically relatedobjects or attributes in the input prompts; a challenge termed semanticbinding. Previous approaches either involve intensive fine-tuning of the entireT2I model or require users or large language models to specify generationlayouts, adding complexity. In this paper, we define semantic binding as thetask of associating a given object with its attribute, termed attributebinding, or linking it to other related sub-objects, referred to as objectbinding. We introduce a novel method called Token Merging (ToMe), whichenhances semantic binding by aggregating relevant tokens into a singlecomposite token. This ensures that the object, its attributes and sub-objectsall share the same cross-attention map. Additionally, to address potentialconfusion among main objects with complex textual prompts, we propose end tokensubstitution as a complementary strategy. To further refine our approach in theinitial stages of T2I generation, where layouts are determined, we incorporatetwo auxiliary losses, an entropy loss and a semantic binding loss, toiteratively update the composite token to improve the generation integrity. Weconducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of ToMe,comparing it against various existing methods on the T2I-CompBench and ourproposed GPT-4o object binding benchmark. Our method is particularly effectivein complex scenarios that involve multiple objects and attributes, whichprevious methods often fail to address.

On Many-Shot In-Context Learning for Long-Context Evaluation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07130v1</link><description>Language models (LMs) have demonstrated an improved capacity to handlelong-context information, yet existing long-context benchmarks primarilymeasure LMs' retrieval abilities with extended inputs, e.g., pinpointing ashort phrase from long-form text. Therefore, they may fall short whenevaluating models' global context understanding capacity, such as synthesizingand reasoning over content across input to generate the response. In thispaper, we study long-context language model (LCLM) evaluation through many-shotin-context learning (ICL). Concretely, we identify the skills each ICL taskrequires, and examine models' long-context capabilities on them. We first ask:What types of ICL tasks benefit from additional demonstrations, and are thesetasks effective at evaluating LCLMs? We find that classification andsummarization tasks show notable performance improvements with additionaldemonstrations, while translation and reasoning tasks do not exhibit cleartrends. This suggests the classification tasks predominantly test models'retrieval skills. Next, we ask: To what extent does each task require retrievalskills versus global context understanding from LCLMs? We develop metrics tocategorize ICL tasks into two groups: (i) retrieval tasks that require strongretrieval ability to pinpoint relevant examples, and (ii) global contextunderstanding tasks that necessitate a deeper comprehension of the full input.We find that not all datasets can effectively evaluate these long-contextcapabilities. To address this gap, we introduce a new many-shot ICL benchmark,MANYICLBENCH, designed to characterize LCLMs' retrieval and global contextunderstanding capabilities separately. Benchmarking 11 open-weight LCLMs withMANYICLBENCH, we find that while state-of-the-art models perform well inretrieval tasks up to 64k tokens, many show significant drops in global contexttasks at just 16k tokens.</description><author>Kaijian Zou, Muhammad Khalifa, Lu Wang</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 17:00:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07130v1</guid></item><item><title>Adam-mini: Use Fewer Learning Rates To Gain More</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16793v6</link><description>We propose Adam-mini, an optimizer that achieves on par or better performancethan AdamW with 50% less memory footprint. Adam-mini reduces memory by cuttingdown the learning rate resources in Adam (i.e., $1/\sqrt{v}$). By investigatingthe Hessian structure of neural nets, we find Adam's $v$ might not function atits full potential as effectively as we expected. We find that $\geq$ 99.9% ofthese learning rates in $v$ could be harmlessly removed if we (1) carefullypartition the parameters into blocks following our new principle on Hessianstructure; (2) assign a single but good learning rate to each parameter block.We then provide one simple way to find good learning rates and proposeAdam-mini. Empirically, we verify that Adam-mini performs on par or better thanAdamW on various language models sized from 39M to 13B for pre-training,supervised fine-tuning, and RLHF. The reduced memory footprint of Adam-minialso alleviates communication overheads among GPUs, thereby increasingthroughput.

This has significantly enhanced the replication of complexcognitive tasks such as vision and natural language processing. Despite theseadvances, ANNs struggle with continual learning, adaptable knowledge transfer,robustness, and resource efficiency - capabilities that biological systemshandle seamlessly. Specifically, ANNs often overlook the functional andmorphological diversity of the brain, hindering their computationalcapabilities. Furthermore, incorporating cell-type specific neuromodulatoryeffects into ANNs with neuronal heterogeneity could enable learning at twospatial scales: spiking behavior at the neuronal level, and synaptic plasticityat the circuit level, thereby potentially enhancing their learning abilities.In this article, we summarize recent bio-inspired models, learning rules andarchitectures and propose a biologically-informed framework for enhancing ANNs.Our proposed dual-framework approach highlights the potential of spiking neuralnetworks (SNNs) for emulating diverse spiking behaviors and dendriticcompartments to simulate morphological and functional diversity of neuronalcomputations.

GEM broadens the scenarios where we can benchmarkLLM generation performance-from traditional ones, like machine translation andsummarization, where gold standard references are readily available, tosubjective tasks without clear gold standards, such as academic peer review. GEM uses a generative model to estimate mutual information between candidateand reference responses, without requiring the reference to be a gold standard.In experiments on a human-annotated dataset, GEM demonstrates competitivecorrelations with human scores compared to the state-of-the-art GPT-4oExaminer, and outperforms all other baselines. Additionally, GEM is more robustagainst strategic manipulations, such as rephrasing or elongation, which canartificially inflate scores under a GPT-4o Examiner. We also present GRE-bench (Generating Review Evaluation Benchmark) whichevaluates LLMs based on how well they can generate high-quality peer reviewsfor academic research papers. Because GRE-bench is based upon GEM, it inheritsits robustness properties. Additionally, GRE-bench circumvents datacontamination problems (or data leakage) by using the continuous influx of newopen-access research papers and peer reviews each year.

This paper investigates LLMs' behavior with respect togender stereotypes, in the context of occupation decision making. Our frameworkis designed to investigate and quantify the presence of gender stereotypes inLLMs' behavior via multi-round question answering. Inspired by prior works, weconstruct a dataset by leveraging a standard occupation classificationknowledge base released by authoritative agencies. We tested three LLMs(RoBERTa-large, GPT-3.5-turbo, and Llama2-70b-chat) and found that all modelsexhibit gender stereotypes analogous to human biases, but with differentpreferences.

Recent efficient GNNs are designed to decouple recursivemessage passing from the learning process, and favor Personalized PageRank(PPR) as the underlying feature propagation mechanism. However, most PPR-basedGNNs are designed for static graphs, and efficient PPR maintenance remains asan open problem. Further, there is surprisingly little theoreticaljustification for the choice of PPR, despite its impressive empiricalperformance. In this paper, we are inspired by the recent PPR formulation as an explicit$\ell_1$-regularized optimization problem and propose a unified dynamic graphlearning framework based on sparse node-wise attention. We also present a setof desired properties to justify the choice of PPR in STOA GNNs, and serves asthe guideline for future node attention designs. Meanwhile, we take advantageof the PPR-equivalent optimization formulation and employ the proximal gradientmethod (ISTA) to improve the efficiency of PPR-based GNNs upto 6 times.Finally, we instantiate a simple-yet-effective model (\textsc{GoPPE}) withrobust positional encodings by maximizing PPR previously used as attention.

Overthe past three decades, advancements in functional Magnetic Resonance Imagingand machine learning have greatly improved our ability to map visual stimuli tobrain activity, especially in the visual cortex. Concurrently, research hasexpanded into decoding more complex processes like language and memory acrossthe whole brain, utilizing techniques to handle greater variability and improvesignal accuracy. We argue that "seeing" involves more than just mapping visualstimuli onto the visual cortex; it engages the entire brain, as variousemotions and cognitive states can emerge from observing different scenes. Inthis paper, we develop algorithms to enhance our understanding of visualprocesses by incorporating whole-brain activation maps while individuals areexposed to visual stimuli. We utilize large-scale fMRI encoders and Imagegenerative models pre-trained on large public datasets, which are thenfine-tuned through Image-fMRI contrastive learning. Our models hence can decodevisual experience across the entire cerebral cortex, surpassing the traditionalconfines of the visual cortex. We first compare our method withstate-of-the-art approaches to decoding visual processing and show improvedpredictive semantic accuracy by 43%. A network ablation analysis suggests thatbeyond the visual cortex, the default mode network contributes most to decodingstimuli, in line with the proposed role of this network in sense-making andsemantic processing.

Enforcing thisequivariance primarily involves the tensor products of irreduciblerepresentations (irreps). However, the computational complexity of suchoperations increases significantly as higher-order tensors are used. In thiswork, we propose a systematic approach to substantially accelerate thecomputation of the tensor products of irreps. We mathematically connect thecommonly used Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to the Gaunt coefficients, which areintegrals of products of three spherical harmonics. Through Gaunt coefficients,the tensor product of irreps becomes equivalent to the multiplication betweenspherical functions represented by spherical harmonics. This perspectivefurther allows us to change the basis for the equivariant operations fromspherical harmonics to a 2D Fourier basis. Consequently, the multiplicationbetween spherical functions represented by a 2D Fourier basis can beefficiently computed via the convolution theorem and Fast Fourier Transforms.This transformation reduces the complexity of full tensor products of irrepsfrom $\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L^3)$, where $L$ is the max degree ofirreps. Leveraging this approach, we introduce the Gaunt Tensor Product, whichserves as a new method to construct efficient equivariant operations acrossdifferent model architectures. Our experiments on the Open Catalyst Project and3BPA datasets demonstrate both the increased efficiency and improvedperformance of our approach.</description><author>Shengjie Luo, Tianlang Chen, Aditi S.

Recent works analyze federated learning under morerealistic participation patterns, such as cyclic client availability orarbitrary participation. However, all such works either require strongassumptions (e.g., all clients participate almost surely within a boundedwindow), do not achieve linear speedup and reduced communication rounds, or arenot applicable in the general non-convex setting. In this work, we focus onnonconvex optimization and consider participation patterns in which the chanceof participation over a fixed window of rounds is equal among all clients,which includes cyclic client availability as a special case. Under thissetting, we propose a new algorithm, named Amplified SCAFFOLD, and prove thatit achieves linear speedup, reduced communication, and resilience to dataheterogeneity simultaneously. In particular, for cyclic participation, ouralgorithm is proved to enjoy $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ communication roundsto find an $\epsilon$-stationary point in the non-convex stochastic setting. Incontrast, the prior work under the same setting requires $\mathcal{O}(\kappa^2\epsilon^{-4})$ communication rounds, where $\kappa$ denotes the dataheterogeneity. Therefore, our algorithm significantly reduces communicationrounds due to better dependency in terms of $\epsilon$ and $\kappa$. Ouranalysis relies on a fine-grained treatment of the nested dependence betweenclient participation and errors in the control variates, which results intighter guarantees than previous work. We also provide experimental resultswith (1) synthetic data and (2) real-world data with a large number of clients$(N = 250)$, demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm under periodicclient participation.</description><author>Michael Crawshaw, Mingrui Liu</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:48:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23131v3</guid></item><item><title>Efficient Adaptive Optimization via Subset-Norm and Subspace-Momentum: Fast, Memory-Reduced Training with Convergence Guarantees</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07120v1</link><description>We introduce two complementary techniques for efficient adaptive optimizationthat reduce memory requirements while accelerating training of large-scaleneural networks.

Graph-based machinelearning techniques have emerged as promising tools for Anti-Money Laundering(AML) detection, capturing intricate relationships within money launderingnetworks. However, the effectiveness of AML solutions is hindered by data siloswithin financial institutions, limiting collaboration and overall efficacy.This research presents a novel privacy-preserving approach for collaborativeAML machine learning, facilitating secure data sharing across institutions andborders while preserving privacy and regulatory compliance. Leveraging FullyHomomorphic Encryption (FHE), computations are directly performed on encrypteddata, ensuring the confidentiality of financial data. Notably, FHE over theTorus (TFHE) was integrated with graph-based machine learning using ZamaConcrete ML. The research contributes two key privacy-preserving pipelines.First, the development of a privacy-preserving Graph Neural Network (GNN)pipeline was explored. Optimization techniques like quantization and pruningwere used to render the GNN FHE-compatible.

With the growinginterest in transformer-based architectures, they are now utilized for gesturerecognition. So, we also explore and devise a novel ConvMixFormer architecturefor dynamic hand gestures. The transformers use quadratic scaling of theattention features with the sequential data, due to which these models arecomputationally complex and heavy. We have considered this drawback of thetransformer and designed a resource-efficient model that replaces theself-attention in the transformer with the simple convolutional layer-basedtoken mixer. The computational cost and the parameters used for theconvolution-based mixer are comparatively less than the quadraticself-attention. Convolution-mixer helps the model capture the local spatialfeatures that self-attention struggles to capture due to their sequentialprocessing nature. Further, an efficient gate mechanism is employed instead ofa conventional feed-forward network in the transformer to help the modelcontrol the flow of features within different stages of the proposed model.This design uses fewer learnable parameters which is nearly half the vanillatransformer that helps in fast and efficient training. The proposed method isevaluated on NVidia Dynamic Hand Gesture and Briareo datasets and our model hasachieved state-of-the-art results on single and multimodal inputs. We have alsoshown the parameter efficiency of the proposed ConvMixFormer model compared toother methods.

In theseapplications, coherence across camera frames and multiple views is crucial, beit for robust convergence of a scene reconstruction or for artifact-freefly-throughs. Recent work started mitigating artifacts that break multi-viewcoherence, including popping artifacts due to inconsistent transparency sortingand perspective-correct outlines of (2D) splats. At the same time, real-timerequirements forced such implementations to accept compromises in howtransparency of large assemblies of 3D Gaussians is resolved, in turn breakingcoherence in other ways. In our work, we aim at achieving maximum coherence, byrendering fully perspective-correct 3D Gaussians while using a high-qualityapproximation of accurate blending, hybrid transparency, on a per-pixel level,in order to retain real-time frame rates. Our fast and perspectively accurateapproach for evaluation of 3D Gaussians does not require matrix inversions,thereby ensuring numerical stability and eliminating the need for specialhandling of degenerate splats, and the hybrid transparency formulation forblending maintains similar quality as fully resolved per-pixel transparenciesat a fraction of the rendering costs. We further show that each of these twocomponents can be independently integrated into Gaussian splatting systems. Incombination, they achieve up to 2$\times$ higher frame rates, 2$\times$ fasteroptimization, and equal or better image quality with fewer rendering artifactscompared to traditional 3DGS on common benchmarks.</description><author>Florian Hahlbohm, Fabian Friederichs, Tim Weyrich, Linus Franke, Moritz Kappel, Susana Castillo, Marc Stamminger, Martin Eisemann, Marcus Magnor</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:44:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08129v2</guid></item><item><title>TinyML Security: Exploring Vulnerabilities in Resource-Constrained Machine Learning Systems</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07114v1</link><description>Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) systems, which enable machine learninginference on highly resource-constrained devices, are transforming edgecomputing but encounter unique security challenges.

Recent work in [arXiv:2204.09266] addressed this with a Hessianaveraging scheme that achieves superlinear convergence without higherper-iteration costs. Nonetheless, the method has slow global convergence,requiring up to $\tilde{O}(\kappa^2)$ iterations to reach the superlinear rateof $\tilde{O}((1/t)^{t/2})$, where $\kappa$ is the problem's condition number.In this paper, we propose a novel stochastic Newton proximal extragradientmethod that improves these bounds, achieving a faster global linear rate andreaching the same fast superlinear rate in $\tilde{O}(\kappa)$ iterations.

The problem is that formal language theory pertains specifically torecognizers: machines that receive a string as input and classify whether itbelongs to a language. On the other hand, it is common to instead use proxytasks that are similar in only an informal sense, such as language modeling orsequence-to-sequence transduction. We correct this mismatch by training andevaluating neural networks directly as binary classifiers of strings, using ageneral method that can be applied to a wide variety of languages. As part ofthis, we extend an algorithm recently proposed by Sn{\ae}bjarnarson et al.(2024) to do length-controlled sampling of strings from regular languages, withmuch better asymptotic time complexity than previous methods. We provideresults on a variety of languages across the Chomsky hierarchy for three neuralarchitectures: a simple RNN, an LSTM, and a causally-masked transformer. Wefind that the RNN and LSTM often outperform the transformer, and that auxiliarytraining objectives such as language modeling can help, although no singleobjective uniformly improves performance across languages and architectures.Our contributions will facilitate theoretically sound empirical testing oflanguage recognition claims in future work.

These shortcuts hingeon spurious correlations between labels and latent features existing in thetraining data. At inference time, shortcut-dependent models are likely togenerate erroneous predictions under distribution shifts, particularly whensome latent features are no longer correlated with the labels. To avoid this,previous studies have trained models to eliminate the reliance on shortcuts. Inthis study, we explore a different direction: pessimistically aggregating thepredictions of a mixture-of-experts, assuming each expert captures relativelydifferent latent features. The experimental results demonstrate that ourpost-hoc control over the experts significantly enhances the model's robustnessto the distribution shift in shortcuts. Besides, we show that our approach hassome practical advantages.

Ourplug-and-play hand restoration solution is compatible with existing pretraineddiffusion models, and the restoration process facilitates adoption by eschewingany fine-tuning or training requirements for the diffusion models.

Two novel types of MFG QRE enable themodeling of large agent populations where individuals only noisily estimate thetrue objective. We also introduce a second source of bounded rationality toMFGs by restricting agents' planning horizon. The resulting novel recedinghorizon (RH) MFGs are combined with QRE and existing approaches to modeldifferent aspects of bounded rationality in MFGs.

Furthermore, the advent of REST API specifications such asthe OpenAPI Specification has led to the emergence of many black-box REST APItesting tools. However, these tools often focus on individual test elements inisolation (e.g., APIs, parameters, values), resulting in lower coverage andless effectiveness in detecting faults (i.e., 500 response codes). To addressthese limitations, we present AutoRestTest, the first black-box framework toadopt a dependency-embedded multi-agent approach for REST API testing,integrating Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with a Semantic PropertyDependency Graph (SPDG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach treatsREST API testing as a separable problem, where four agents -- API, dependency,parameter, and value -- collaborate to optimize API exploration. LLMs handledomain-specific value restrictions, the SPDG model simplifies the search spacefor dependencies using a similarity score between API operations, and MARLdynamically optimizes the agents' behavior. Evaluated on 12 real-world RESTservices, AutoRestTest outperforms the four leading black-box REST API testingtools, including those assisted by RESTGPT (which augments realistic testinputs using LLMs), in terms of code coverage, operation coverage, and faultdetection.

To unify both controllability and complexity, we introduceArctique, a procedurally generated dataset modeled after histopathologicalcolon images. We chose histopathological images for two reasons: 1) theircomplexity in terms of intricate object structures and highly variableappearance, which yields challenging segmentation problems, and 2) their broadprevalence for medical diagnosis and respective relevance of high-quality UQ.To generate Arctique, we established a Blender-based framework for 3D scenecreation with intrinsic noise manipulation. Arctique contains 50,000 renderedimages with precise masks as well as noisy label simulations. We show that byindependently controlling the uncertainty in both images and labels, we caneffectively study the performance of several commonly used UQ methods. Hence,Arctique serves as a critical resource for benchmarking and advancing UQtechniques and other methodologies in complex, multi-object environments,bridging the gap between realism and controllability.

One widely used technique to tackle MOO isthrough linear scalarization, where one fixed preference vector is used tocombine the objectives into a single scalar value for optimization. However,recent work (Hu et al., 2024) has shown linear scalarization often fails tocapture the non-convex regions of the Pareto Front, failing to recover thecomplete set of Pareto optimal solutions. In light of the above limitations,this paper focuses on Tchebycheff scalarization that optimizes for theworst-case objective. In particular, we propose an online mirror descentalgorithm for Tchebycheff scalarization, which we call OMD-TCH. We show thatOMD-TCH enjoys a convergence rate of $O(\sqrt{\log m/T})$ where $m$ is thenumber of objectives and $T$ is the number of iteration rounds. We also proposea novel adaptive online-to-batch conversion scheme that significantly improvesthe practical performance of OMD-TCH while maintaining the same convergenceguarantees. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OMD-TCH and the adaptiveconversion scheme on both synthetic problems and federated learning tasks underfairness constraints, showing state-of-the-art performance.</description><author>Meitong Liu, Xiaoyuan Zhang, Chulin Xie, Kate Donahue, Han Zhao</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:17:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21764v2</guid></item><item><title>Efficient Online Scheduling and Routing for Automated Guided Vehicles In Loop-Based Graphs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02195v3</link><description>Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are widely used in various industries, andscheduling and routing them in a conflict-free manner is crucial to theirefficient operation.
