In this work, we explorean unsupervised approach to translation direction detection based on the simplehypothesis that$p(\text{translation}|\text{original})&gt;p(\text{original}|\text{translation})$,motivated by the well-known simplification effect in translationese ormachine-translationese. In experiments with massively multilingual machinetranslation models across 20 translation directions, we confirm theeffectiveness of the approach for high-resource language pairs, achievingdocument-level accuracies of 82-96% for NMT-produced translations, and 60-81%for human translations, depending on the model used.

The prompt template, or the way the inputexamples are formatted to obtain the prompt, is an important yet oftenoverlooked aspect of in-context learning. In this work, we conduct acomprehensive study of the template format's influence on the in-contextlearning performance. We evaluate the impact of the prompt template acrossmodels (from 770M to 70B parameters) and 4 standard classification datasets. Weshow that a poor choice of the template can reduce the performance of thestrongest models and inference methods to a random guess level. Moreimportantly, the best templates do not transfer between different setups andeven between models of the same family. Our findings show that the currentlyprevalent approach to evaluation, which ignores template selection, may givemisleading results due to different templates in different works. As a firststep towards mitigating this issue, we propose Template Ensembles thataggregate model predictions across several templates. This simple test-timeaugmentation boosts average performance while being robust to the choice ofrandom set of templates.</description><author>Anton Voronov, Lena Wolf, Max Ryabinin</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 18:58:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06766v1</guid></item><item><title>Robust Peak Detection for Holter ECGs by Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02381v2</link><description>Although numerous R-peak detectors have been proposed in the literature,their robustness and performance levels may significantly deteriorate inlow-quality and noisy signals acquired from mobile electrocardiogram (ECG)sensors, such as Holter monitors. Recently, this issue has been addressed bydeep 1-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that have achievedstate-of-the-art performance levels in Holter monitors; however, they pose ahigh complexity level that requires special parallelized hardware setup forreal-time processing. On the other hand, their performance deteriorates when acompact network configuration is used instead. This is an expected outcome asrecent studies have demonstrated that the learning performance of CNNs islimited due to their strictly homogenous configuration with the sole linearneuron model. In this study, to further boost the peak detection performancealong with an elegant computational efficiency, we propose 1-D Self-OrganizedONNs (Self-ONNs) with generative neurons. The most crucial advantage of 1-DSelf-ONNs over the ONNs is their self-organization capability that voids theneed to search for the best operator set per neuron since each generativeneuron has the ability to create the optimal operator during training. Theexperimental results over the China Physiological Signal Challenge-2020 (CPSC)dataset with more than one million ECG beats show that the proposed 1-DSelf-ONNs can significantly surpass the state-of-the-art deep CNN with lesscomputational complexity. Results demonstrate that the proposed solutionachieves a 99.10% F1-score, 99.79% sensitivity, and 98.42% positivepredictivity in the CPSC dataset, which is the best R-peak detectionperformance ever achieved.</description><author>Moncef Gabbouj, Serkan Kiranyaz, Junaid Malik, Muhammad Uzair Zahid, Turker Ince, Muhammad Chowdhury, Amith Khandakar, Anas Tahir</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 18:53:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02381v2</guid></item><item><title>Seeing the roads through the trees: A benchmark for modeling spatial dependencies with aerial imagery</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06762v1</link><description>Fully understanding a complex high-resolution satellite or aerial imageryscene often requires spatial reasoning over a broad relevant context. The humanobject recognition system is able to understand object in a scene over along-range relevant context. For example, if a human observes an aerial scenethat shows sections of road broken up by tree canopy, then they will beunlikely to conclude that the road has actually been broken up into disjointpieces by trees and instead think that the canopy of nearby trees is occludingthe road. However, there is limited research being conducted to understandlong-range context understanding of modern machine learning models. In thiswork we propose a road segmentation benchmark dataset, Chesapeake Roads SpatialContext (RSC), for evaluating the spatial long-range context understanding ofgeospatial machine learning models and show how commonly used semanticsegmentation models can fail at this task. For example, we show that a U-Nettrained to segment roads from background in aerial imagery achieves an 84%recall on unoccluded roads, but just 63.5% recall on roads covered by treecanopy despite being trained to model both the same way. We further analyze howthe performance of models changes as the relevant context for a decision(unoccluded roads in our case) varies in distance.

However, the auto-regressive decoding process, which isfundamental to how most LLMs generate text, poses challenges to achieveefficient serving. In this work, we introduce a parallel auto-regressivegeneration method. By instruct-tuning on general domain data that containshierarchical structures, we enable LLMs to independently plan their generationprocess and perform auto-parallel auto-regressive (APAR) generation,significantly reducing the number of generation steps. APAR alone can achieveup to 2x speed-up, and when combined with speculative decoding, the speed-upcan reach up to 4x. In addition, APAR reduces the key-value cache consumptionand attention computation during generation. This leads to a throughputincrease of 20-70% and a latency reduce of 20-35% in high-throughput scenarios,compared to state-of-the-art serving frameworks.</description><author>Mingdao Liu, Aohan Zeng, Bowen Wang, Peng Zhang, Jie Tang, Yuxiao Dong</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 18:50:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06761v1</guid></item><item><title>Navigating the Metrics Maze: Reconciling Score Magnitudes and Accuracies</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06760v1</link><description>Ten years ago a single metric, BLEU, governed progress in machine translationresearch. For better or worse, there is no such consensus today, andconsequently it is difficult for researchers to develop and retain the kinds ofheuristic intuitions about metric deltas that drove earlier research anddeployment decisions. This paper investigates the "dynamic range" of a numberof modern metrics in an effort to provide a collective understanding of themeaning of differences in scores both within and among metrics; in other words,we ask what point difference X in metric Y is required between two systems forhumans to notice? We conduct our evaluation on a new large dataset, ToShip23,using it to discover deltas at which metrics achieve system-level differencesthat are meaningful to humans, which we measure by pairwise system accuracy. Weadditionally show that this method of establishing delta-accuracy is morestable than the standard use of statistical p-values in regards to testsetsize. Where data size permits, we also explore the effect of metric deltas andaccuracy across finer-grained features such as translation direction, domain,and system closeness.</description><author>Tom Kocmi, Vilém Zouhar, Christian Federmann, Matt Post</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 18:47:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06760v1</guid></item><item><title>Synthetic Data Generation Framework, Dataset, and Efficient Deep Model for Pedestrian Intention Prediction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06757v1</link><description>Pedestrian intention prediction is crucial for autonomous driving. Inparticular, knowing if pedestrians are going to cross in front of theego-vehicle is core to performing safe and comfortable maneuvers. Creatingaccurate and fast models that predict such intentions from sequential images ischallenging. A factor contributing to this is the lack of datasets with diversecrossing and non-crossing (C/NC) scenarios. We address this scarceness byintroducing a framework, named ARCANE, which allows programmatically generatingsynthetic datasets consisting of C/NC video clip samples. As an example, we useARCANE to generate a large and diverse dataset named PedSynth. We will show howPedSynth complements widely used real-world datasets such as JAAD and PIE, soenabling more accurate models for C/NC prediction. Considering the onboarddeployment of C/NC prediction models, we also propose a deep model namedPedGNN, which is fast and has a very low memory footprint. PedGNN is based on aGNN-GRU architecture that takes a sequence of pedestrian skeletons as input topredict crossing intentions.</description><author>Muhammad Naveed Riaz, Maciej Wielgosz, Abel Garcia Romera, Antonio M.

The solver within AI4PDEs uses tools from machine learning (ML)libraries to solve (exactly) partial differential equations (PDEs) that havebeen discretised using numerical methods. Convolutional layers can be used toexpress the discretisations as a neural network, whose weights are determinedby the numerical method, rather than by training. To solve the system, amultigrid solver is implemented through a neural network with a U-Netarchitecture. Immiscible two-phase flow is modelled by the 3D incompressibleNavier-Stokes equations with surface tension and advection of a volume fractionfield, which describes the interface between the fluids. A new compressivealgebraic volume-of-fluids method is introduced, based on a residualformulation using Petrov-Galerkin for accuracy and designed with AI4PDEs inmind. High-order finite-element based schemes are chosen to model a collapsingwater column and a rising bubble. Results compare well with experimental dataand other numerical results from the literature, demonstrating that, for thefirst time, finite element discretisations of multiphase flows can be solvedusing the neural network solver from the AI4PDEs approach. A benefit ofexpressing numerical discretisations as neural networks is that the code canrun, without modification, on CPUs, GPUs or the latest accelerators designedespecially to run AI codes.</description><author>Boyang Chen, Claire E.

However, advancements in stylometryhave provided opportunities for automatic authorship and author changedetection in multi-authored documents using style analysis techniques. Styleanalysis can serve as a primary step toward document provenance andauthentication through authorship detection. This paper investigates three keytasks of style analysis: (i) classification of single and multi-authoreddocuments, (ii) single change detection, which involves identifying the pointwhere the author switches, and (iii) multiple author-switching detection inmulti-authored documents. We formulate all three tasks as classificationproblems and propose a merit-based fusion framework that integrates severalstate-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and weightoptimization techniques. We also explore the potential of special characters,which are typically removed during pre-processing in NLP applications, on theperformance of the proposed methods for these tasks by conducting extensiveexperiments on both cleaned and raw datasets. Experimental results demonstratesignificant improvements over existing solutions for all three tasks on abenchmark dataset.</description><author>Muhammad Tayyab Zamir, Muhammad Asif Ayub, Asma Gul, Nasir Ahmad, Kashif Ahmad</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 18:36:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06752v1</guid></item><item><title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Easy Training Data for Hard Tasks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06751v1</link><description>How can we train models to perform well on hard test data when hard trainingdata is by definition difficult to label correctly? This question has beentermed the scalable oversight problem and has drawn increasing attention aslanguage models have continually improved. In this paper, we present thesurprising conclusion that current language models often generalize relativelywell from easy to hard data, even performing as well as "oracle" models trainedon hard data. We demonstrate this kind of easy-to-hard generalization usingsimple training methods like in-context learning, linear classifier heads, andQLoRA for seven different measures of datapoint hardness, including sixempirically diverse human hardness measures (like grade level) and onemodel-based measure (loss-based). Furthermore, we show that even if one caresmost about model performance on hard data, it can be better to collect andtrain on easy data rather than hard data, since hard data is generally noisierand costlier to collect. Our experiments use open models up to 70b in size andfour publicly available question-answering datasets with questions ranging indifficulty from 3rd grade science questions to college level STEM questions andgeneral-knowledge trivia. We conclude that easy-to-hard generalization in LMsis surprisingly strong for the tasks studied, suggesting the scalable oversightproblem may be easier than previously thought.

One of the key attributes of the audiospectrogram is the temporal resolution, which depends on the hop size used inthe Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Previous works generally assume thehop size should be a constant value (e.g., 10 ms). However, a fixed temporalresolution is not always optimal for different types of sound. The temporalresolution affects not only classification accuracy but also computationalcost. This paper proposes a novel method, DiffRes, that enables differentiabletemporal resolution modeling for audio classification. Given a spectrogramcalculated with a fixed hop size, DiffRes merges non-essential time frameswhile preserving important frames. DiffRes acts as a "drop-in" module betweenan audio spectrogram and a classifier and can be jointly optimized with theclassification task. We evaluate DiffRes on five audio classification tasks,using mel-spectrograms as the acoustic features, followed by off-the-shelfclassifier backbones. Compared with previous methods using the fixed temporalresolution, the DiffRes-based method can achieve the equivalent or betterclassification accuracy with at least 25% computational cost reduction. Wefurther show that DiffRes can improve classification accuracy by increasing thetemporal resolution of input acoustic features, without adding to thecomputational cost.</description><author>Haohe Liu, Xubo Liu, Qiuqiang Kong, Wenwu Wang, Mark D.

To develop dialogueagents with unique personas, models are trained to converse given a specificpersona, but hand-crafting these persona can be time-consuming, thus methodsexist to automatically extract persona information from existingcharacter-specific dialogue. However, these persona-extraction models are alsotrained on datasets derived from PersonaChat and struggle to providehigh-quality persona information from conversational settings that do not takeplace in the real world, such as the fantasy-focused dataset, LIGHT. Creatingnew data to train models on a specific setting is human-intensive, thusprohibitively expensive. To address both these issues, we introduce a naturallanguage inference method for post-hoc adapting a trained persona extractionmodel to a new setting. We draw inspiration from the literature of dialognatural language inference (NLI), and devise NLI-reranking methods to extractstructured persona information from dialogue. Compared to existing personaextraction models, our method returns higher-quality extracted persona andrequires less human annotation.</description><author>Alexandra DeLucia, Mengjie Zhao, Yoshinori Maeda, Makoto Yoda, Keiichi Yamada, Hiromi Wakaki</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 18:25:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06742v1</guid></item><item><title>A deep implicit-explicit minimizing movement method for option pricing in jump-diffusion models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06740v1</link><description>We develop a novel deep learning approach for pricing European basket optionswritten on assets that follow jump-diffusion dynamics. The option pricingproblem is formulated as a partial integro-differential equation, which isapproximated via a new implicit-explicit minimizing movement time-steppingapproach, involving approximation by deep, residual-type Artificial NeuralNetworks (ANNs) for each time step. The integral operator is discretized viatwo different approaches: a) a sparse-grid Gauss--Hermite approximationfollowing localised coordinate axes arising from singular value decompositions,and b) an ANN-based high-dimensional special-purpose quadrature rule.Crucially, the proposed ANN is constructed to ensure the asymptotic behavior ofthe solution for large values of the underlyings and also leads to consistentoutputs with respect to a priori known qualitative properties of the solution.The performance and robustness with respect to the dimension of the methods areassessed in a series of numerical experiments involving the Mertonjump-diffusion model.</description><author>Emmanuil H.

Improving autonomous tracking systems will enableunmanned aerial, surface, and underwater vehicles to better assist ininterdicting smugglers that use manned surface, semi-submersible, and aerialvessels. As unmanned drones proliferate, accurate autonomous target estimationis even more crucial for security and safety. This paper presents ConstrainedAgent-based Diffusion for Enhanced Multi-Agent Tracking (CADENCE), an approachaimed at generating comprehensive predictions of adversary locations byleveraging past sparse state information. To assess the effectiveness of thisapproach, we evaluate predictions on single-target and multi-target pursuitenvironments, employing Monte-Carlo sampling of the diffusion model to estimatethe probability associated with each generated trajectory. We propose a novelcross-attention based diffusion model that utilizes constraint-based samplingto generate multimodal track hypotheses. Our single-target model surpasses theperformance of all baseline methods on Average Displacement Error (ADE) forpredictions across all time horizons.</description><author>Sean Ye, Manisha Natarajan, Zixuan Wu, Matthew Gombolay</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 18:20:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06244v2</guid></item><item><title>Noise-adaptive (Accelerated) Stochastic Heavy-Ball Momentum</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06738v1</link><description>We analyze the convergence of stochastic heavy ball (SHB) momentum in thesmooth, strongly-convex setting. Kidambi et al. (2018) show that SHB (withsmall mini-batches) cannot attain an accelerated rate of convergence even forquadratics, and conjecture that the practical gain of SHB is a by-product ofmini-batching. We substantiate this claim by showing that SHB can obtain anaccelerated rate when the mini-batch size is larger than some threshold. Inparticular, for strongly-convex quadratics with condition number $\kappa$, weprove that SHB with the standard step-size and momentum parameters results inan $O\left(\exp(-\frac{T}{\sqrt{\kappa}}) + \sigma \right)$ convergence rate,where $T$ is the number of iterations and $\sigma^2$ is the variance in thestochastic gradients. To ensure convergence to the minimizer, we propose amulti-stage approach that results in a noise-adaptive$O\left(\exp\left(-\frac{T}{\sqrt{\kappa}} \right) + \frac{\sigma}{T}\right)$rate. For general strongly-convex functions, we use the averaginginterpretation of SHB along with exponential step-sizes to prove an$O\left(\exp\left(-\frac{T}{\kappa} \right) + \frac{\sigma^2}{T} \right)$convergence to the minimizer in a noise-adaptive manner. Finally, weempirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description><author>Anh Dang, Reza Babanezhad, Sharan Vaswani</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 18:17:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06738v1</guid></item><item><title>A finite sample analysis of the benign overfitting phenomenon for ridge function estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12882v5</link><description>Recent extensive numerical experiments in high scale machine learning haveallowed to uncover a quite counterintuitive phase transition, as a function ofthe ratio between the sample size and the number of parameters in the model.

Withthe rise of advanced generative AI models capable of tasks once reserved forhuman creativity, the study of AI's creative potential becomes imperative forits responsible development and application. In this paper, we provide atheoretical answer to the question of whether AI can be creative. We prove intheory that AI can be as creative as humans under the condition that AI can fitthe existing data generated by human creators. Therefore, the debate on AI'screativity is reduced into the question of its ability of fitting a massiveamount of data. To arrive at this conclusion, this paper first addresses thecomplexities in defining creativity by introducing a new concept calledRelative Creativity. Instead of trying to define creativity universally, weshift the focus to whether AI can match the creative abilities of ahypothetical human. This perspective draws inspiration from the Turing Test,expanding upon it to address the challenges and subjectivities inherent inassessing creativity. This methodological shift leads to a statisticallyquantifiable assessment of AI's creativity, which we term StatisticalCreativity. This concept allows for comparisons of AI's creative abilities withthose of specific human groups, and facilitates the theoretical findings ofAI's creative potential. Building on this foundation, we discuss theapplication of statistical creativity in prompt-conditioned autoregressivemodels, providing a practical means for evaluating creative abilities ofcontemporary AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs). In addition todefining and analyzing creativity, we introduce an actionable trainingguideline, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical quantification ofcreativity and practical model training.</description><author>Haonan Wang, James Zou, Michael Mozer, Anirudh Goyal, Alex Lamb, Linjun Zhang, Weijie J Su, Zhun Deng, Michael Qizhe Xie, Hannah Brown, Kenji Kawaguchi</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 18:03:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01623v3</guid></item><item><title>Relying on the Unreliable: The Impact of Language Models' Reluctance to Express Uncertainty</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06730v1</link><description>As natural language becomes the default interface for human-AI interaction,there is a critical need for LMs to appropriately communicate uncertainties indownstream applications.

We examine publiclydeployed models and find that LMs are unable to express uncertainties whenanswering questions even when they produce incorrect responses. LMs can beexplicitly prompted to express confidences, but tend to be overconfident,resulting in high error rates (on average 47%) among confident responses.

Given the capabilities of LLMs in generatinghuman-understandable text, we propose leveraging the model itself to explainits internal representations in natural language. We introduce a frameworkcalled Patchscopes and show how it can be used to answer a wide range ofquestions about an LLM's computation.

Moreover, several of their shortcomings such as failure ininspecting early layers or lack of expressivity can be mitigated byPatchscopes.

For example, such models could beused for plagiarism, disinformation, spam, or phishing. However, such abuse maybe counteracted with the ability to detect whether a piece of text was composedby a language model rather than a human. Some previous approaches to thisproblem have relied on supervised methods trained on corpora of confirmed humanand machine-written documents. Unfortunately, model under-specification posesan unavoidable challenge for neural network-based detectors, making thembrittle in the face of data shifts, such as the release of further languagemodels producing still more fluent text than the models used to train thedetectors. Other previous approaches require access to the models that may havegenerated a document in question at inference or detection time, which is oftenimpractical. In light of these challenges, we pursue a fundamentally differentapproach not relying on samples from language models of concern at trainingtime. Instead, we propose to leverage representations of writing styleestimated from human-authored text. Indeed, we find that features effective atdistinguishing among human authors are also effective at distinguishing humanfrom machine authors, including state of the art large language models likeLlama 2, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. Furthermore, given a handful of examples composedby each of several specific language models of interest, our approach affordsthe ability to predict which model generated a given document.</description><author>Rafael Rivera Soto, Kailin Koch, Aleem Khan, Barry Chen, Marcus Bishop, Nicholas Andrews</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 17:26:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06712v1</guid></item><item><title>Model-Free Approximate Bayesian Learning for Large-Scale Conversion Funnel Optimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06710v1</link><description>The flexibility of choosing the ad action as a function of the consumer stateis critical for modern-day marketing campaigns. We study the problem ofidentifying the optimal sequential personalized interventions that maximize theadoption probability for a new product. We model consumer behavior by aconversion funnel that captures the state of each consumer (e.g., interactionhistory with the firm) and allows the consumer behavior to vary as a functionof both her state and firm's sequential interventions. We show our modelcaptures consumer behavior with very high accuracy (out-of-sample AUC of over0.95) in a real-world email marketing dataset. However, it results in a verylarge-scale learning problem, where the firm must learn the state-specificeffects of various interventions from consumer interactions. We propose a novelattribution-based decision-making algorithm for this problem that we callmodel-free approximate Bayesian learning. Our algorithm inherits theinterpretability and scalability of Thompson sampling for bandits and maintainsan approximate belief over the value of each state-specific intervention. Thebelief is updated as the algorithm interacts with the consumers. Despite beingan approximation to the Bayes update, we prove the asymptotic optimality of ouralgorithm and analyze its convergence rate. We show that our algorithmsignificantly outperforms traditional approaches on extensive simulationscalibrated to a real-world email marketing dataset.</description><author>Garud Iyengar, Raghav Singal</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 17:19:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06710v1</guid></item><item><title>Reliability Analysis of Psychological Concept Extraction and Classification in User-penned Text</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06709v1</link><description>The social NLP research community witness a recent surge in the computationaladvancements of mental health analysis to build responsible AI models for acomplex interplay between language use and self-perception.

Importantly, the main aim in theory works onthe subject is to understand the extent to which convergence rates -- inlearning a common representation -- \emph{may scale with the number $N$ oftasks} (as well as the number of samples per task). First steps in this settingdemonstrate this property when both the shared representation amongst tasks,and task-specific regression functions, are linear. This linear setting readilyreveals the benefits of aggregating tasks, e.g., via averaging arguments. Inpractice, however, the representation is often highly nonlinear, introducingnontrivial biases in each task that cannot easily be averaged out as in thelinear case. In the present work, we derive theoretical guarantees formeta-learning with nonlinear representations. In particular, assuming theshared nonlinearity maps to an infinite-dimensional RKHS, we show thatadditional biases can be mitigated with careful regularization that leveragesthe smoothness of task-specific regression functions,</description><author>Dimitri Meunier, Zhu Li, Arthur Gretton, Samory Kpotufe</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 17:15:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10870v3</guid></item><item><title>Multi-Candidate Speculative Decoding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06706v1</link><description>Large language models have shown impressive capabilities across a variety ofNLP tasks, yet their generating text autoregressively is time-consuming.

To mitigate this cost, machine learningmethods, such as transfer learning, semi-supervised learning and activelearning, aim to be label-efficient: achieving high predictive performance fromrelatively few labeled examples. While obtaining the best label-efficiency inpractice often requires combinations of these techniques, existing benchmarkand evaluation frameworks do not capture a concerted combination of all suchtechniques. This paper addresses this deficiency by introducing LabelBench, anew computationally-efficient framework for joint evaluation of multiplelabel-efficient learning techniques. As an application of LabelBench, weintroduce a novel benchmark of state-of-the-art active learning methods incombination with semi-supervised learning for fine-tuning pretrained visiontransformers.

Unlike existing approaches that are based onback-propagation (BP) and chain rule gradient-based optimization (which impliesiterative execution, potentially burdensome and time-consuming in some cases),the proposed approach offers the solution for weight optimization inclosed-form by means of least squares (LS) methodology. In the case where theinput-to-output mapping is injective, the new approach optimizes the weights ina back-propagating fashion in a single iteration by jointly optimizing a set ofweights in each layer for each neuron. In the case where the input-to-outputmapping is not injective (e.g., in classification problems), the proposedsolution is easily adapted to obtain its final solution in a few iterations. Animportant advantage over the existing solutions is that these computations (forall neurons in a layer) are independent from each other; thus, they can becarried out in parallel to optimize all weights in a given layersimultaneously. Furthermore, its running time is deterministic in the sensethat one can obtain the exact number of computations necessary to optimize theweights in all network layers (per iteration, in the case of non-injectivemapping). Our simulation and empirical results show that the proposed scheme,BPLS, works well and is competitive with existing ones in terms of accuracy,but significantly surpasses them in terms of running time. To summarize, thenew method is straightforward to implement, is competitive and computationallymore efficient than the existing ones, and is well-tailored for parallelimplementation.</description><author>Slavisa Tomic, João Pedro Matos-Carvalho, Marko Beko</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 17:03:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06699v1</guid></item><item><title>An Experimental Design Framework for Label-Efficient Supervised Finetuning of Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06692v1</link><description>Supervised finetuning (SFT) on instruction datasets has played a crucial rolein achieving the remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities observed inmodern large language models (LLMs). However, the annotation efforts requiredto produce high quality responses for instructions are becoming prohibitivelyexpensive, especially as the number of tasks spanned by instruction datasetscontinues to increase. Active learning is effective in identifying usefulsubsets of samples to annotate from an unlabeled pool, but its highcomputational cost remains a barrier to its widespread applicability in thecontext of LLMs. To mitigate the annotation cost of SFT and circumvent thecomputational bottlenecks of active learning, we propose using experimentaldesign. Experimental design techniques select the most informative samples tolabel, and typically maximize some notion of uncertainty and/or diversity. Inour work, we implement a framework that evaluates several existing and novelexperimental design techniques and find that these methods consistently yieldsignificant gains in label efficiency with little computational overhead. Ongenerative tasks, our methods achieve the same generalization performance withonly $50\%$ of annotation cost required by random sampling.</description><author>Gantavya Bhatt, Yifang Chen, Arnav M.

The planogramcompliance control block utilizes sequence alignment through a modifiedNeedleman-Wunsch algorithm. This block is also working along with the objectdetection block on the same single board computers. The energy harvesting andpower management block consists of solar and RF energy harvesting modules withsuitable battery pack for operation. We tested the proposed embedded planogramcompliance control system on two different datasets to provide valuableinsights on its strengths and weaknesses.

Inspired by existing domain generalization methods,we adopt the feature alignment idea and propose a framework called SleepDG tosolve it. Considering both of local salient features and sequential featuresare important for sleep staging, we propose a Multi-level Feature Alignmentcombining epoch-level and sequence-level feature alignment to learndomain-invariant feature representations. Specifically, we design anEpoch-level Feature Alignment to align the feature distribution of each singlesleep epoch among different domains, and a Sequence-level Feature Alignment tominimize the discrepancy of sequential features among different domains.SleepDG is validated on five public datasets, achieving the state-of-the-artperformance.</description><author>Jiquan Wang, Sha Zhao, Haiteng Jiang, Shijian Li, Tao Li, Gang Pan</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 16:17:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05363v2</guid></item><item><title>Asynchronous Algorithmic Alignment with Cocycles</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15632v3</link><description>State-of-the-art neural algorithmic reasoners make use of message passing ingraph neural networks (GNNs). But typical GNNs blur the distinction between thedefinition and invocation of the message function, forcing a node to sendmessages to its neighbours at every layer, synchronously. When applying GNNs tolearn to execute dynamic programming algorithms, however, on most steps only ahandful of the nodes would have meaningful updates to send. One, hence, runsthe risk of inefficiencies by sending too much irrelevant data across thegraph. But more importantly, many intermediate GNN steps have to learn theidentity functions, which is a non-trivial learning problem. In this work, weexplicitly separate the concepts of node state update and message functioninvocation. With this separation, we obtain a mathematical formulation thatallows us to reason about asynchronous computation in both algorithms andneural networks. Our analysis yields several practical implementations ofsynchronous scalable GNN layers that are provably invariant under various formsof asynchrony.</description><author>Andrew Dudzik, Tamara von Glehn, Razvan Pascanu, Petar Veličković</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 16:13:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15632v3</guid></item><item><title>How Johnny Can Persuade LLMs to Jailbreak Them: Rethinking Persuasion to Challenge AI Safety by Humanizing LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06373v1</link><description>Most traditional AI safety research has approached AI models as machines andcentered on algorithm-focused attacks developed by security experts.

Loop optimization is centralto this technique, and several polyhedral schedulers like Feautrier, Pluto, island Tensor Scheduler have been proposed, each of them targeting a differentarchitecture, parallelism model, or application scenario. The need forscenario-specific optimization is growing due to the heterogeneity ofarchitectures. One of the most critical cases is represented by NPUs (NeuralProcessing Units) used for AI, which may require loop optimization withdifferent objectives. Another factor to be considered is the framework orcompiler in which polyhedral optimization takes place. Different scenarios,depending on the target architecture, compilation environment, and applicationdomain, may require different kinds of optimization to best exploit thearchitecture feature set. We introduce a new configurable polyhedral scheduler, PolyTOPS, that can beadjusted to various scenarios with straightforward, high-level configurations.This scheduler allows the creation of diverse scheduling strategies that can beboth scenario-specific (like state-of-the-art schedulers) and kernel-specific,breaking the concept of a one-size-fits-all scheduler approach. PolyTOPS hasbeen used with isl and CLooG as code generators and has been integrated inMindSpore AKG deep learning compiler. Experimental results in differentscenarios show good performance: a geomean speedup of 7.66x on MindSpore (forthe NPU Ascend architecture) hybrid custom operators over isl scheduling, ageomean speedup up to 1.80x on PolyBench on different multicore architecturesover Pluto scheduling.

However, most previous works relied on superficialinformation, neglecting the incorporation of contextual world knowledge (e.g.,background information derived from but beyond the given image and text pairs)and thereby restricting their ability to achieve better multimodal sentimentanalysis. In this paper, we proposed a plug-in framework named WisdoM, designedto leverage contextual world knowledge induced from the large vision-languagemodels (LVLMs) for enhanced multimodal sentiment analysis. WisdoM utilizes aLVLM to comprehensively analyze both images and corresponding sentences,simultaneously generating pertinent context. To reduce the noise in thecontext, we also introduce a training-free Contextual Fusion mechanism.Experimental results across diverse granularities of multimodal sentimentanalysis tasks consistently demonstrate that our approach has substantialimprovements (brings an average +1.89 F1 score among five advanced methods)over several state-of-the-art methods.

However, many real-worldproblems involve partial observations, formulated as partially observableMarkov decision processes (POMDPs). Previous studies have tackled RL in POMDPsby either incorporating the memory of past actions and observations or byinferring the true state of the environment from observed data. However,aggregating observed data over time becomes impractical in continuous spaces.Moreover, inference-based RL approaches often require many samples to performwell, as they focus solely on reward maximization and neglect uncertainty inthe inferred state. Active inference (AIF) is a framework formulated in POMDPsand directs agents to select actions by minimizing a function called expectedfree energy (EFE). This supplies reward-maximizing (exploitative) behaviour, asin RL, with information-seeking (exploratory) behaviour. Despite thisexploratory behaviour of AIF, its usage is limited to discrete spaces due tothe computational challenges associated with EFE. In this paper, we propose aunified principle that establishes a theoretical connection between AIF and RL,enabling seamless integration of these two approaches and overcoming theiraforementioned limitations in continuous space POMDP settings. We substantiateour findings with theoretical analysis, providing novel perspectives forutilizing AIF in the design of artificial agents. Experimental resultsdemonstrate the superior learning capabilities of our method in solvingcontinuous space partially observable tasks. Notably, our approach harnessesinformation-seeking exploration, enabling it to effectively solve reward-freeproblems and rendering explicit task reward design by an external supervisoroptional.</description><author>Parvin Malekzadeh, Konstantinos N.

However, occlusion strategies can vary significantly fromsimple mean replacement up to inpainting with state-of-the-art diffusionmodels. This ambiguity limits the usefulness of occlusion-based approaches. Forexample, PF benchmarks lead to contradicting rankings. This is amplified bycompeting PF measures: Features are either removed starting with mostinfluential first (MIF) or least influential first (LIF). This study proposestwo complementary perspectives to resolve this disagreement problem. Firstly,we address the common criticism of occlusion-based XAI, that artificial sampleslead to unreliable model evaluations. We propose to measure the reliability bythe R(eference)-Out-of-Model-Scope (OMS) score. The R-OMS score enables asystematic comparison of occlusion strategies and resolves the disagreementproblem by grouping consistent PF rankings. Secondly, we show that theinsightfulness of MIF and LIF is conversely dependent on the R-OMS score. Toleverage this, we combine the MIF and LIF measures into the symmetric relevancegain (SRG) measure. This breaks the inherent connection to the underlyingocclusion strategy and leads to consistent rankings. This resolves thedisagreement problem, which we verify for a set of 40 different occlusionstrategies.</description><author>Stefan Blücher, Johanna Vielhaben, Nils Strodthoff</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 16:01:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06654v1</guid></item><item><title>Data-Efficient Interactive Multi-Objective Optimization Using ParEGO</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06649v1</link><description>Multi-objective optimization is a widely studied problem in diverse fields,such as engineering and finance, that seeks to identify a set of non-dominatedsolutions that provide optimal trade-offs among competing objectives. However,the computation of the entire Pareto front can become prohibitively expensive,both in terms of computational resources and time, particularly when dealingwith a large number of objectives. In practical applications, decision-makers(DMs) will select a single solution of the Pareto front that aligns with theirpreferences to be implemented; thus, traditional multi-objective algorithmsinvest a lot of budget sampling solutions that are not interesting for the DM.In this paper, we propose two novel algorithms that employ Gaussian Processesand advanced discretization methods to efficiently locate the most preferredregion of the Pareto front in expensive-to-evaluate problems. Our approachinvolves interacting with the decision-maker to guide the optimization processtowards their preferred trade-offs. Our experimental results demonstrate thatour proposed algorithms are effective in finding non-dominated solutions thatalign with the decision-maker's preferences while maintaining computationalefficiency.</description><author>Arash Heidari, Sebastian Rojas Gonzalez, Tom Dhaene, Ivo Couckuyt</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 15:55:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06649v1</guid></item><item><title>Simultaneous Task Allocation and Planning for Multi-Robots under Hierarchical Temporal Logic Specifications</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04003v2</link><description>Past research into robotic planning with temporal logic specifications,notably Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), was largely based on singular formulas forindividual or groups of robots. But with increasing task complexity, LTLformulas unavoidably grow lengthy, complicating interpretation andspecification generation, and straining the computational capacities of theplanners. By leveraging the intrinsic structure of tasks, we introduced ahierarchical structure to LTL specifications with requirements on syntax andsemantics, and proved that they are more expressive than their flatcounterparts. Second, we employ a search-based approach to synthesize plans fora multi-robot system, accomplishing simultaneous task allocation and planning.The search space is approximated by loosely interconnected sub-spaces, witheach sub-space corresponding to one LTL specification. The search ispredominantly confined to a single sub-space, transitioning to anothersub-space under certain conditions, determined by the decomposition ofautomatons. Moreover, multiple heuristics are formulated to expedite the searchsignificantly. A theoretical analysis concerning completeness and optimality isconducted under mild assumptions. When compared with existing methods onservice tasks, our method outperforms in terms of execution times withcomparable solution quality.

Recent approaches to incrementally learning theclassifier by freezing the feature extractor after the first task have gainedmuch attention. In this paper, we explore prototypical networks for CIL, whichgenerate new class prototypes using the frozen feature extractor and classifythe features based on the Euclidean distance to the prototypes. In an analysisof the feature distributions of classes, we show that classification based onEuclidean metrics is successful for jointly trained features. However, whenlearning from non-stationary data, we observe that the Euclidean metric issuboptimal and that feature distributions are heterogeneous. To address thischallenge, we revisit the anisotropic Mahalanobis distance for CIL. Inaddition, we empirically show that modeling the feature covariance relations isbetter than previous attempts at sampling features from normal distributionsand training a linear classifier. Unlike existing methods, our approachgeneralizes to both many- and few-shot CIL settings, as well as todomain-incremental settings.

Despite showing impressive zero-shot capabilities, apre-defined set of categories, a.k.a. the vocabulary, is assumed at test timefor composing the textual prompts. However, such assumption can be impracticalwhen the semantic context is unknown and evolving. We thus formalize a noveltask, termed as Vocabulary-free Image Classification (VIC), where we aim toassign to an input image a class that resides in an unconstrainedlanguage-induced semantic space, without the prerequisite of a knownvocabulary. VIC is a challenging task as the semantic space is extremely large,containing millions of concepts, with hard-to-discriminate fine-grainedcategories. In this work, we first empirically verify that representing thissemantic space by means of an external vision-language database is the mosteffective way to obtain semantically relevant content for classifying theimage. We then propose Category Search from External Databases (CaSED), amethod that exploits a pre-trained vision-language model and an externalvision-language database to address VIC in a training-free manner. CaSED firstextracts a set of candidate categories from captions retrieved from thedatabase based on their semantic similarity to the image, and then assigns tothe image the best matching candidate category according to the samevision-language model. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate that CaSEDoutperforms other complex vision-language frameworks, while being efficientwith much fewer parameters, paving the way for future research in thisdirection.</description><author>Alessandro Conti, Enrico Fini, Massimiliano Mancini, Paolo Rota, Yiming Wang, Elisa Ricci</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 15:34:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00917v3</guid></item><item><title>Adversarial Examples are Misaligned in Diffusion Model Manifolds</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06637v1</link><description>In recent years, diffusion models (DMs) have drawn significant attention fortheir success in approximating data distributions, yielding state-of-the-artgenerative results.

Theexisting bounding box regression methods usually consider the geometricrelationship between the GT box and the predicted box, and calculate the lossby using the relative position and shape of the bounding boxes, while ignoringthe influence of inherent properties such as the shape and scale of thebounding boxes on bounding box regression. In order to make up for theshortcomings of existing research, this article proposes a bounding boxregression method that focuses on the shape and scale of the bounding boxitself. Firstly, we analyzed the regression characteristics of the boundingboxes and found that the shape and scale factors of the bounding boxesthemselves will have an impact on the regression results. Based on the aboveconclusions, we propose the Shape IoU method, which can calculate the loss byfocusing on the shape and scale of the bounding box itself, thereby making thebounding box regression more accurate.

Our evaluation of 23 leading large language models (LLMs), includingboth general and code-specialized models, reveals three key insights: 1) pass@ooffers a more relevant and comprehensive assessment for OOP code generation; 2)Despite excelling in FP, code-specialized LLMs like WizardCoder lag in OOPcompared to models like ChatGPT; 3) The poor performance of all advanced LLMson our OOP benchmark highlights a critical need for improvements in this field.Our benchmark and scripts are publicly released at:https://github.com/alphadl/OOP-eval.</description><author>Shuai Wang, Liang Ding, Li Shen, Yong Luo, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 15:21:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06628v1</guid></item><item><title>TransliCo: A Contrastive Learning Framework to Address the Script Barrier in Multilingual Pretrained Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06620v1</link><description>There are 293 scripts representing over 7,000 languages in the written form.Due to various reasons, many closely related languages use different scripts,which poses difficulty for multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs) inlearning crosslingual knowledge through lexical overlap. As a result, mPLMspresent a script barrier: representations from different scripts are located indifferent subspaces, which is a strong indicator of why crosslingual transferinvolving languages of different scripts shows sub-optimal performance. Toaddress this problem, we propose a simple framework TransliCo that containsTransliteration Contrastive Modeling (TCM) to fine-tune an mPLM by contrastingsentences in its training data and their transliterations in a unified script(Latn, in our case), which ensures uniformity in the representation space fordifferent scripts. Using Glot500-m, an mPLM pretrained on over 500 languages,as our source model, we find-tune it on a small portion (5\%) of its trainingdata, and refer to the resulting model as Furina. We show that Furina not onlybetter aligns representations from distinct scripts but also outperforms theoriginal Glot500-m on various crosslingual transfer tasks. Additionally, weachieve consistent improvement in a case study on the Indic group where thelanguages are highly related but use different scripts. We make our code andmodels publicly available.</description><author>Yihong Liu, Chunlan Ma, Haotian Ye, Hinrich Schütze</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 15:12:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06620v1</guid></item><item><title>Motion2VecSets: 4D Latent Vector Set Diffusion for Non-rigid Shape Reconstruction and Tracking</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06614v1</link><description>We introduce Motion2VecSets, a 4D diffusion model for dynamic surfacereconstruction from point cloud sequences. While existing state-of-the-artmethods have demonstrated success in reconstructing non-rigid objects usingneural field representations, conventional feed-forward networks encounterchallenges with ambiguous observations from noisy, partial, or sparse pointclouds. To address these challenges, we introduce a diffusion model thatexplicitly learns the shape and motion distribution of non-rigid objectsthrough an iterative denoising process of compressed latent representations.The diffusion-based prior enables more plausible and probabilisticreconstructions when handling ambiguous inputs. We parameterize 4D dynamicswith latent vector sets instead of using a global latent. This novel 4Drepresentation allows us to learn local surface shape and deformation patterns,leading to more accurate non-linear motion capture and significantly improvinggeneralizability to unseen motions and identities. For more temporal-coherentobject tracking, we synchronously denoise deformation latent sets and exchangeinformation across multiple frames. To avoid the computational overhead, wedesign an interleaved space and time attention block to alternately aggregatedeformation latents along spatial and temporal domains. Extensive comparisonsagainst the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of ourMotion2VecSets in 4D reconstruction from various imperfect observations,notably achieving a 19% improvement in Intersection over Union (IoU) comparedto CaDex for reconstructing unseen individuals from sparse point clouds on theDeformingThings4D-Animals dataset.

As the models' size increases, LMs demonstrate enhancements inmeasurable aspects and the development of new qualitative features. However,despite researchers' attention and the rapid growth in LM application, thecapabilities, limitations, and associated risks still need to be betterunderstood. To address these issues, we introduce an open Multimodal Evaluationof Russian-language Architectures (MERA), a new instruction benchmark forevaluating foundation models oriented towards the Russian language. Thebenchmark encompasses 21 evaluation tasks for generative models in 11 skilldomains and is designed as a black-box test to ensure the exclusion of dataleakage. The paper introduces a methodology to evaluate FMs and LMs in zero-and few-shot fixed instruction settings that can be extended to othermodalities. We propose an evaluation methodology, an open-source code base forthe MERA assessment, and a leaderboard with a submission system. We evaluateopen LMs as baselines and find that they are still far behind the human level.We publicly release MERA to guide forthcoming research, anticipategroundbreaking model features, standardize the evaluation procedure, andaddress potential societal drawbacks.</description><author>Alena Fenogenova, Artem Chervyakov, Nikita Martynov, Anastasia Kozlova, Maria Tikhonova, Albina Akhmetgareeva, Anton Emelyanov, Denis Shevelev, Pavel Lebedev, Leonid Sinev, Ulyana Isaeva, Katerina Kolomeytseva, Daniil Moskovskiy, Elizaveta Goncharova, Nikita Savushkin, Polina Mikhailova, Denis Dimitrov, Alexander Panchenko, Sergei Markov</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 15:04:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04531v2</guid></item><item><title>NAAQA: A Neural Architecture for Acoustic Question Answering</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06147v3</link><description>The goal of the Acoustic Question Answering (AQA) task is to answer afree-form text question about the content of an acoustic scene. It was inspiredby the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. In this paper, based on thepreviously introduced CLEAR dataset, we propose a new benchmark for AQA, namelyCLEAR2, that emphasizes the specific challenges of acoustic inputs. Theseinclude handling of variable duration scenes, and scenes built with elementarysounds that differ between training and test set. We also introduce NAAQA, aneural architecture that leverages specific properties of acoustic inputs. Theuse of 1D convolutions in time and frequency to process 2D spectro-temporalrepresentations of acoustic content shows promising results and enablesreductions in model complexity. We show that time coordinate maps augmenttemporal localization capabilities which enhance performance of the network by~17 percentage points. On the other hand, frequency coordinate maps have littleinfluence on this task. NAAQA achieves 79.5% of accuracy on the AQA task with~4 times fewer parameters than the previously explored VQA model. We evaluatethe perfomance of NAAQA on an independent data set reconstructed from DAQA.

This work proposes a coupling flow thatpreserves SE(3) and permutation equivariance by performing coordinate splitsalong additional augmented dimensions. At each layer, the flow maps atoms'positions into learned SE(3) invariant bases, where we apply standard flowtransformations, such as monotonic rational-quadratic splines, before returningto the original basis. Crucially, our flow preserves fast sampling and densityevaluation, and may be used to produce unbiased estimates of expectations withrespect to the target distribution via importance sampling. When trained on theDW4, LJ13, and QM9-positional datasets, our flow is competitive withequivariant continuous normalizing flows and diffusion models, while allowingsampling more than an order of magnitude faster. Moreover, to the best of ourknowledge, we are the first to learn the full Boltzmann distribution of alaninedipeptide by only modeling the Cartesian positions of its atoms. Lastly, wedemonstrate that our flow can be trained to approximately sample from theBoltzmann distribution of the DW4 and LJ13 particle systems using only theirenergy functions.</description><author>Laurence I.

In this work, we introduce a novel approach for changedetection that can leverage off-the-shelf, unlabeled remote sensing images inthe training process by pre-training a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model(DDPM) - a class of generative models used in image synthesis. DDPMs learn thetraining data distribution by gradually converting training images into aGaussian distribution using a Markov chain. During inference (i.e., sampling),they can generate a diverse set of samples closer to the training distribution,starting from Gaussian noise, achieving state-of-the-art image synthesisresults. However, in this work, our focus is not on image synthesis but onutilizing it as a pre-trained feature extractor for the downstream applicationof change detection. Specifically, we fine-tune a lightweight change classifierutilizing the feature representations produced by the pre-trained DDPMalongside change labels. Experiments conducted on the LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD,DSIFN-CD, and CDD datasets demonstrate that the proposed DDPM-CD methodsignificantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art change detectionmethods in terms of F1 score, IoU, and overall accuracy, highlighting thepivotal role of pre-trained DDPM as a feature extractor for downstreamapplications.

However, the problems of LLMs and RL model collaboration stillneed to be solved. In this study, we employ a teacher-student learningframework to tackle these problems, specifically by offering feedback for LLMsusing RL models and providing high-level information for RL models with LLMs ina cooperative multi-agent setting. Within this framework, the LLM acts as ateacher, while the RL model acts as a student. The two agents cooperativelyassist each other through a process of recursive help, such as "I help you helpI help." The LLM agent supplies abstract information to the RL agent, enablingefficient exploration and policy improvement. In turn, the RL agent offersfeedback to the LLM agent, providing valuable, real-time information that helpsgenerate more useful tokens. This bi-directional feedback loop promotesoptimization, exploration, and mutual improvement for both agents, enablingthem to accomplish increasingly challenging tasks.

We study the effects of competition andcooperation on this tradeoff. Suppose there are $k$ arms and two players, Aliceand Bob. In every round, each player pulls an arm, receives the resultingreward, and observes the choice of the other player but not their reward.Alice's utility is $\Gamma_A + \lambda \Gamma_B$ (and similarly for Bob), where$\Gamma_A$ is Alice's total reward and $\lambda \in [-1, 1]$ is a cooperationparameter. At $\lambda = -1$ the players are competing in a zero-sum game, at$\lambda = 1$, they are fully cooperating, and at $\lambda = 0$, they areneutral: each player's utility is their own reward. The model is related to theeconomics literature on strategic experimentation, where usually playersobserve each other's rewards. With discount factor $\beta$, the Gittins index reduces the one-playerproblem to the comparison between a risky arm, with a prior $\mu$, and apredictable arm, with success probability $p$. The value of $p$ where theplayer is indifferent between the arms is the Gittins index $g = g(\mu,\beta) &gt;m$, where $m$ is the mean of the risky arm. We show that competing players explore less than a single player: there is$p^* \in (m, g)$ so that for all $p &gt; p^*$, the players stay at the predictablearm. However, the players are not myopic: they still explore for some $p &gt; m$.On the other hand, cooperating players explore more than a single player. Wealso show that neutral players learn from each other, receiving strictly highertotal rewards than they would playing alone, for all $ p\in (p^*, g)$, where$p^*$ is the threshold from the competing case. Finally, we show that competing and neutral players eventually settle on thesame arm in every Nash equilibrium, while this can fail for cooperatingplayers.</description><author>Simina Brânzei, Yuval Peres</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 14:32:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01135v4</guid></item><item><title>Stable Nonconvex-Nonconcave Training via Linear Interpolation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13459v2</link><description>This paper presents a theoretical analysis of linear interpolation as aprincipled method for stabilizing (large-scale) neural network training.

The range of cohypomonotoneproblems in which Lookahead converges is further expanded by exploiting thatLookahead inherits the properties of the base optimizer.

For example, theAnchor algorithm applies a statistical analysis of the sensitivity of theclassifier to changes in the token. Aggregating local explanations over adataset provides a global explanation of the model. Such aggregation aims todetect words with the most impact, giving valuable insights about the model,like what it has learned in training and which adversarial examples expose itsweaknesses. However, standard aggregation methods bear a high computationalcost: a na\"ive implementation applies a costly algorithm to each token of eachdocument, and hence, it is infeasible for a simple user running in the scope ofa short analysis session. % We devise techniques for accelerating the globalaggregation of the Anchor algorithm. Specifically, our goal is to compute a setof top-$k$ words with the highest global impact according to differentaggregation functions.

It is known that SNNs areenergy-efficient but difficult to train. Consequently, many researchers haveproposed various methods to solve this problem, among which online trainingthrough time (OTTT) is a method that allows inferring at each time step whilesuppressing the memory cost. However, to compute efficiently on GPUs, OTTTrequires operations with spike trains and weighted summation of spike trainsduring forwarding. In addition, OTTT has shown a relationship with the SpikeRepresentation, an alternative training method, though theoretical agreementwith Spike Representation has yet to be proven. Our proposed method can solvethese problems; namely, SAF can halve the number of operations during theforward process, and it can be theoretically proven that SAF is consistent withthe Spike Representation and OTTT, respectively. Furthermore, we confirmed theabove contents through experiments and showed that it is possible to reducememory and training time while maintaining accuracy.</description><author>Ryuji Saiin, Tomoya Shirakawa, Sota Yoshihara, Yoshihide Sawada, Hiroyuki Kusumoto</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 13:59:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02772v4</guid></item><item><title>Multistage Collaborative Knowledge Distillation from Large Language Models for Semi-Supervised Sequence Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08640v2</link><description>We study semi-supervised sequence generation tasks where labeled data are tooscarce to effectively finetune a model and at the same time few-shot promptingof a large language model (LLM) has suboptimal performance. This happens when atask, such as parsing, is expensive to annotate and also unfamiliar to apretrained LLM. In this paper, we present a discovery that student modelsdistilled from an in-context learned LLM can often generalize better than theirteacher on such tasks. Leveraging this finding, we present a new method --multistage collaborative knowledge distillation from an LLM (MCKD) -- for suchtasks. MCKD first few-shot prompts an LLM to produce pseudolabels for unlabeleddata. At each intermediate knowledge distillation (KD) stage, a new pair ofstudents is trained on disjoint partitions of the pseudolabeled data. Eachstudent then produces new and improved pseudolabels for its unseen partition tobe used in the next stage of distillation. We demonstrate the advantage ofmultistage cross-partition labeling on several syntactic and semantic parsingtasks. On CRAFT biomedical parsing, for example, 3-stage MCKD with 50 labeledexamples outperforms the prompted LLM and vanilla KD by 7.5% and 3.7% parsingF1, respectively, and matches the performance of supervised finetuning with 500examples.</description><author>Jiachen Zhao, Wenlong Zhao, Andrew Drozdov, Benjamin Rozonoyer, Md Arafat Sultan, Jay-Yoon Lee, Mohit Iyyer, Andrew McCallum</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 13:57:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08640v2</guid></item><item><title>360DVD: Controllable Panorama Video Generation with 360-Degree Video Diffusion Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06578v1</link><description>360-degree panoramic videos recently attract more interest in both studiesand applications, courtesy of the heightened immersive experiences theyengender. Due to the expensive cost of capturing 360-degree panoramic videos,generating desirable panoramic videos by given prompts is urgently required.Recently, the emerging text-to-video (T2V) diffusion methods demonstratenotable effectiveness in standard video generation. However, due to thesignificant gap in content and motion patterns between panoramic and standardvideos, these methods encounter challenges in yielding satisfactory 360-degreepanoramic videos. In this paper, we propose a controllable panorama videogeneration pipeline named 360-Degree Video Diffusion model (360DVD) forgenerating panoramic videos based on the given prompts and motion conditions.Concretely, we introduce a lightweight module dubbed 360-Adapter and assisted360 Enhancement Techniques to transform pre-trained T2V models for 360-degreevideo generation. We further propose a new panorama dataset named WEB360consisting of 360-degree video-text pairs for training 360DVD, addressing theabsence of captioned panoramic video datasets. Extensive experimentsdemonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of 360DVD for panorama videogeneration.

Interpolation of thesetypes of time series is crucial for tasks such as root cause analysis andmedical diagnosis, as well as for smoothing out irregular or noisy data. Toaddress this challenge, we present a novel encoder-decoder architecture called"Tripletformer" for probabilistic interpolation of irregularly sampled timeseries with missing values. This attention-based model operates on sets ofobservations, where each element is composed of a triple of time, channel, andvalue. The encoder and decoder of the Tripletformer are designed with attentionlayers and fully connected layers, enabling the model to effectively processthe presented set elements. We evaluate the Tripletformer against a range ofbaselines on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets and show that itproduces more accurate and certain interpolations. Results indicate animprovement in negative loglikelihood error by up to 32% on real-world datasetsand 85% on synthetic datasets when using the Tripletformer compared to the nextbest model.</description><author>Vijaya Krishna Yalavarthi, Johannes Burchert, Lars Schmidt-thieme</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 13:43:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02091v2</guid></item><item><title>Lost in the Source Language: How Large Language Models Evaluate the Quality of Machine Translation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06568v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in the machinetranslation evaluation task, yet there remains a gap in knowledge regarding howthey utilize the provided data to conduct evaluations. This study aims toexplore how LLMs leverage source and reference information in evaluatingtranslations, with the ultimate goal of better understanding the workingmechanism of LLMs. To this end, we design the controlled experiments acrossvarious input modes and model types, and employ both coarse-grained andfine-grained prompts to discern the utility of source versus referenceinformation. Surprisingly, we find that reference information significantlyenhances the evaluation accuracy, while source information sometimes iscounterproductive, indicating a lack of cross-lingual capability when usingLLMs to evaluate translations. We further conduct a meta-evaluation fortranslation error detection of LLMs, observing a similar phenomenon.

The state space of atypical agent is finite. Our approach begins with a comprehensive review of themaximum entropy IRL problem concerning deterministic and stochastic Markovdecision processes (MDPs) in both finite and infinite-horizon scenarios.Subsequently, we formulate the maximum casual entropy IRL problem for MFGs - anon-convex optimization problem with respect to policies. Leveraging the linearprogramming formulation of MDPs, we restructure this IRL problem into a convexoptimization problem and establish a gradient descent algorithm to compute theoptimal solution with a rate of convergence. Finally, we present a newalgorithm by formulating the MFG problem as a generalized Nash equilibriumproblem (GNEP), which is capable of computing the mean-field equilibrium (MFE)for the forward RL problem. This method is employed to produce data for anumerical example.

These methods typicallyrequire that all the confounders are observed to ensure identification of theeffects. We contribute by showing how valid semiparametric inference can beobtained in the presence of unobserved confounders and high-dimensionalnuisance models. We propose uncertainty intervals which allow for unobservedconfounding, and show that the resulting inference is valid when the amount ofunobserved confounding is small relative to the sample size; the latter isformalized in terms of convergence rates.

Inthis study, we present a simple yet highly effective defense strategy, i.e.,Intention Analysis Prompting (IAPrompt). The principle behind is to triggerLLMs' inherent self-correct and improve ability through a two-stage process: 1)essential intention analysis, and 2) policy-aligned response. Notably, IAPromptis an inference-only method, thus could enhance the safety of LLMs withoutcompromising their helpfulness. Extensive experiments on SAP200 and DANbenchmarks across Vicuna, ChatGLM, MPT, DeepSeek, and GPT-3.5 show thatIAPrompt could consistently and significantly reduce the harmfulness inresponse (averagely -46.5% attack success rate) and maintain the generalhelpfulness.

To mitigate the problem, a line of methods propose toreplay the data of experienced tasks when learning new tasks. These methodsusually adopt an extra memory to store the data for replay. However, it is notexpected in practice considering the memory constraint or data privacy issue.As a replacement, data-free data replay methods are proposed by invertingsamples from the classification model. Though achieving good results, thesemethods still suffer from the inconsistency of the inverted and real trainingdata, which is neglected in the inversion stage in recent works. To thateffect, we propose to measure the data consistency quantitatively by somesimplification and assumptions. Using the measurement, we analyze existingtechniques for inverting samples and get some insightful information thatinspires a novel loss function to reduce the inconsistency. Specifically, theloss minimizes the KL divergence of the distributions of inverted and real dataunder the tied multivariate Gaussian assumption, which is easy to implement incontinual learning. In addition, we observe that the norms of old class weightsturn to decrease continually as learning progresses. We thus analyze theunderlying reasons and propose a simple regularization term to balance theclass weights so that the samples of old classes are more distinguishable.

To achieve theoptimal balance among these points, this paper proposes a lightweightfull-convolutional Siamese tracker called LightFC. LightFC employs a novelefficient cross-correlation module (ECM) and a novel efficient rep-center head(ERH) to improve the feature representation of the convolutional trackingpipeline. The ECM uses an attention-like module design, which conducts spatialand channel linear fusion of fused features and enhances the nonlinearity ofthe fused features. Additionally, it refers to successful factors of currentlightweight trackers and introduces skip-connections and reuse of search areafeatures. The ERH reparameterizes the feature dimensional stage in the standardcenter-head and introduces channel attention to optimize the bottleneck of keyfeature flows. Comprehensive experiments show that LightFC achieves the optimalbalance between performance, parameters, Flops and FPS. The precision score ofLightFC outperforms MixFormerV2-S on LaSOT and TNL2K by 3.7 % and 6.5 %,respectively, while using 5x fewer parameters and 4.6x fewer Flops. Besides,LightFC runs 2x faster than MixFormerV2-S on CPUs. In addition, ahigher-performance version named LightFC-vit is proposed by replacing a morepowerful backbone network.
