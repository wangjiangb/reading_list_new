Numerous previous works train their modelsusing the well-established connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss.During the inference stage, the CTC-based models typically take the entire signvideo as input to make predictions. This type of inference scheme is referredto as offline recognition. In contrast, while mature speech recognition systemscan efficiently recognize spoken words on the fly, sign language recognitionstill falls short due to the lack of practical online solutions. In this work,we take the first step towards filling this gap. Our approach comprises threephases: 1) developing a sign language dictionary encompassing all glossespresent in a target sign language dataset; 2) training an isolated signlanguage recognition model on augmented signs using both conventionalclassification loss and our novel saliency loss; 3) employing a sliding windowapproach on the input sign sequence and feeding each sign clip to thewell-optimized model for online recognition. Furthermore, our onlinerecognition model can be extended to boost the performance of any offlinemodel, and to support online translation by appending a gloss-to-text networkonto the recognition model. By integrating our online framework with thepreviously best-performing offline model, TwoStream-SLR, we achieve newstate-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks: Phoenix-2014, Phoenix-2014T,and CSL-Daily.

Based on a user-provided textual descriptionand a 2D bounding box in a reference viewpoint, InseRF generates new objects in3D scenes. Recently, methods for 3D scene editing have been profoundlytransformed, owing to the use of strong priors of text-to-image diffusionmodels in 3D generative modeling. Existing methods are mostly effective inediting 3D scenes via style and appearance changes or removing existingobjects. Generating new objects, however, remains a challenge for such methods,which we address in this study. Specifically, we propose grounding the 3Dobject insertion to a 2D object insertion in a reference view of the scene. The2D edit is then lifted to 3D using a single-view object reconstruction method.The reconstructed object is then inserted into the scene, guided by the priorsof monocular depth estimation methods. We evaluate our method on various 3Dscenes and provide an in-depth analysis of the proposed components. Ourexperiments with generative insertion of objects in several 3D scenes indicatethe effectiveness of our method compared to the existing methods. InseRF iscapable of controllable and 3D-consistent object insertion without requiringexplicit 3D information as input.

To bridge this gap, we present URHand, the first universalrelightable hand model that generalizes across viewpoints, poses,illuminations, and identities. Our model allows few-shot personalization usingimages captured with a mobile phone, and is ready to be photorealisticallyrendered under novel illuminations. To simplify the personalization processwhile retaining photorealism, we build a powerful universal relightable priorbased on neural relighting from multi-view images of hands captured in a lightstage with hundreds of identities. The key challenge is scaling thecross-identity training while maintaining personalized fidelity and sharpdetails without compromising generalization under natural illuminations. Tothis end, we propose a spatially varying linear lighting model as the neuralrenderer that takes physics-inspired shading as input feature. By removingnon-linear activations and bias, our specifically designed lighting modelexplicitly keeps the linearity of light transport. This enables single-stagetraining from light-stage data while generalizing to real-time rendering underarbitrary continuous illuminations across diverse identities. In addition, weintroduce the joint learning of a physically based model and our neuralrelighting model, which further improves fidelity and generalization. Extensiveexperiments show that our approach achieves superior performance over existingmethods in terms of both quality and generalizability. We also demonstratequick personalization of URHand from a short phone scan of an unseen identity.</description><author>Zhaoxi Chen, Gyeongsik Moon, Kaiwen Guo, Chen Cao, Stanislav Pidhorskyi, Tomas Simon, Rohan Joshi, Yuan Dong, Yichen Xu, Bernardo Pires, He Wen, Lucas Evans, Bo Peng, Julia Buffalini, Autumn Trimble, Kevyn McPhail, Melissa Schoeller, Shoou-I Yu, Javier Romero, Michael Zollhöfer, Yaser Sheikh, Ziwei Liu, Shunsuke Saito</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:59:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05334v1</guid></item><item><title>KirchhoffNet: A Circuit Bridging Message Passing and Continuous-Depth Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15872v2</link><description>In this paper, we exploit a fundamental principle of analog electroniccircuitry, Kirchhoff's current law, to introduce a unique class of neuralnetwork models that we refer to as KirchhoffNet. KirchhoffNet establishes closeconnections with message passing neural networks and continuous-depth networks.We demonstrate that even in the absence of any traditional layers (such asconvolution, pooling, or linear layers), KirchhoffNet attains 98.86% testaccuracy on the MNIST dataset, comparable with state of the art (SOTA) results.What makes KirchhoffNet more intriguing is its potential in the realm ofhardware. Contemporary deep neural networks are conventionally deployed onGPUs. In contrast, KirchhoffNet can be physically realized by an analogelectronic circuit. Moreover, we justify that irrespective of the number ofparameters within a KirchhoffNet, its forward calculation can always becompleted within 1/f seconds, with f representing the hardware's clockfrequency. This characteristic introduces a promising technology forimplementing ultra-large-scale neural networks.</description><author>Zhengqi Gao, Fan-Keng Sun, Duane S.

Consider students in schools,cells in patients, or cities in states. In such settings, unit-level variables(e.g. each school's budget) may affect subunit-level variables (e.g. the testscores of each student in each school) and vice versa. To address causalquestions with hierarchical data, we propose hierarchical causal models, whichextend structural causal models and causal graphical models by adding innerplates. We develop a general graphical identification technique forhierarchical causal models that extends do-calculus. We find many situations inwhich hierarchical data can enable causal identification even when it would beimpossible with non-hierarchical data, that is, if we had only unit-levelsummaries of subunit-level variables (e.g. the school's average test score,rather than each student's score). We develop estimation techniques forhierarchical causal models, using methods including hierarchical Bayesianmodels. We illustrate our results in simulation and via a reanalysis of theclassic "eight schools" study.</description><author>Eli N. Weinstein, David M.

Yet, for them to be accepted bycustomers, trust in their punctuality is vital. Many pilot initiatives operatewithout a fixed schedule, thus enhancing the importance of reliable arrivaltime (AT) predictions. This study presents an AT prediction system forautonomous shuttles, utilizing separate models for dwell and running timepredictions, validated on real-world data from five cities. Alongsideestablished methods such as XGBoost, we explore the benefits of integratingspatial data using graph neural networks (GNN). To accurately handle the caseof a shuttle bypassing a stop, we propose a hierarchical model combining arandom forest classifier and a GNN. The results for the final AT prediction arepromising, showing low errors even when predicting several stops ahead. Yet, nosingle model emerges as universally superior, and we provide insights into thecharacteristics of pilot sites that influence the model selection process.Finally, we identify dwell time prediction as the key determinant in overall ATprediction accuracy when autonomous shuttles are deployed in low-traffic areasor under regulatory speed limits. This research provides insights into thecurrent state of autonomous public transport prediction models and paves theway for more data-informed decision-making as the field advances.</description><author>Carolin Schmidt, Mathias Tygesen, Filipe Rodrigues</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:41:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05322v1</guid></item><item><title>Leveraging Print Debugging to Improve Code Generation in Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05319v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in codegeneration tasks, but their performance in tackling programming problems withcomplex data structures and algorithms remains suboptimal. To address thisissue, we propose an in-context learning approach that guides LLMs to debug byusing a "print debugging" method, which involves inserting print statements totrace and analysing logs for fixing the bug.

Yet, FL inevitably introduces inefficiencies compared tocentralized model training, which will further increase the already high energyusage and associated carbon emissions of machine learning in the future. Oneidea to reduce FL's carbon footprint is to schedule training jobs based on theavailability of renewable excess energy that can occur at certain times andplaces in the grid. However, in the presence of such volatile and unreliableresources, existing FL schedulers cannot always ensure fast, efficient, andfair training. We propose FedZero, an FL system that operates exclusively on renewableexcess energy and spare capacity of compute infrastructure to effectivelyreduce a training's operational carbon emissions to zero. Using energy and loadforecasts, FedZero leverages the spatio-temporal availability of excessresources by selecting clients for fast convergence and fair participation. Ourevaluation, based on real solar and load traces, shows that FedZero convergessignificantly faster than existing approaches under the mentioned constraintswhile consuming less energy. Furthermore, it is robust to forecasting errorsand scalable to tens of thousands of clients.</description><author>Philipp Wiesner, Ramin Khalili, Dennis Grinwald, Pratik Agrawal, Lauritz Thamsen, Odej Kao</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:37:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15092v3</guid></item><item><title>ANIM-400K: A Large-Scale Dataset for Automated End-To-End Dubbing of Video</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05314v1</link><description>The Internet's wealth of content, with up to 60% published in English,starkly contrasts the global population, where only 18.8% are English speakers,and just 5.1% consider it their native language, leading to disparities inonline information access. Unfortunately, automated processes for dubbing ofvideo - replacing the audio track of a video with a translated alternative -remains a complex and challenging task due to pipelines, necessitating precisetiming, facial movement synchronization, and prosody matching. While end-to-enddubbing offers a solution, data scarcity continues to impede the progress ofboth end-to-end and pipeline-based methods. In this work, we introduceAnim-400K, a comprehensive dataset of over 425K aligned animated video segmentsin Japanese and English supporting various video-related tasks, includingautomated dubbing, simultaneous translation, guided video summarization, andgenre/theme/style classification. Our dataset is made publicly available forresearch purposes at https://github.com/davidmchan/Anim400K.</description><author>Kevin Cai, Chonghua Liu, David M.

This diversity not onlyenhances the training accuracy of FL models but also hastens their convergence.Yet, applying FL in these expansive networks presents notable challenges,particularly the significant non-IIDness in client data distributions. Suchdata heterogeneity often results in slower convergence rates and reducedeffectiveness in model training performance. Our study introduces a clientselection strategy tailored to address this issue, leveraging user networktraffic behaviour. This strategy involves the prediction and classification ofclients based on their network usage patterns while prioritizing user privacy.By strategically selecting clients whose data exhibit similar patterns forparticipation in FL training, our approach fosters a more uniform andrepresentative data distribution across the network. Our simulationsdemonstrate that this targeted client selection methodology significantlyreduces the training loss of FL models in HAPS networks, thereby effectivelytackling a crucial challenge in implementing large-scale FL systems.</description><author>Amin Farajzadeh, Animesh Yadav, Halim Yanikomeroglu</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:22:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05308v1</guid></item><item><title>Can Probabilistic Feedback Drive User Impacts in Online Platforms?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05304v1</link><description>A common explanation for negative user impacts of content recommender systemsis misalignment between the platform's objective and user welfare. In thiswork, we show that misalignment in the platform's objective is not the onlypotential cause of unintended impacts on users: even when the platform'sobjective is fully aligned with user welfare, the platform's learning algorithmcan induce negative downstream impacts on users. The source of these userimpacts is that different pieces of content may generate observable userreactions (feedback information) at different rates; these feedback rates maycorrelate with content properties, such as controversiality or demographicsimilarity of the creator, that affect the user experience. Since differencesin feedback rates can impact how often the learning algorithm engages withdifferent content, the learning algorithm may inadvertently promote contentwith certain such properties. Using the multi-armed bandit framework withprobabilistic feedback, we examine the relationship between feedback rates anda learning algorithm's engagement with individual arms for different no-regretalgorithms. We prove that no-regret algorithms can exhibit a wide range ofdependencies: if the feedback rate of an arm increases, some no-regretalgorithms engage with the arm more, some no-regret algorithms engage with thearm less, and other no-regret algorithms engage with the arm approximately thesame number of times. From a platform design perspective, our results highlightthe importance of looking beyond regret when measuring an algorithm'sperformance, and assessing the nature of a learning algorithm's engagement withdifferent types of content as well as their resulting downstream impacts.</description><author>Jessica Dai, Bailey Flanigan, Nika Haghtalab, Meena Jagadeesan, Chara Podimata</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:12:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05304v1</guid></item><item><title>Theory of Mind abilities of Large Language Models in Human-Robot Interaction : An Illusion?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05302v1</link><description>Large Language Models have shown exceptional generative abilities in variousnatural language and generation tasks. However, possible anthropomorphizationand leniency towards failure cases have propelled discussions on emergentabilities of Large Language Models especially on Theory of Mind (ToM) abilitiesin Large Language Models. While several false-belief tests exists to verify theability to infer and maintain mental models of another entity, we study aspecial application of ToM abilities that has higher stakes and possiblyirreversible consequences : Human Robot Interaction. In this work, we explorethe task of Perceived Behavior Recognition, where a robot employs a LargeLanguage Model (LLM) to assess the robot's generated behavior in a mannersimilar to human observer. We focus on four behavior types, namely -explicable, legible, predictable, and obfuscatory behavior which have beenextensively used to synthesize interpretable robot behaviors. The LLMs goal is,therefore to be a human proxy to the agent, and to answer how a certain agentbehavior would be perceived by the human in the loop, for example "Given arobot's behavior X, would the human observer find it explicable?". We conduct ahuman subject study to verify that the users are able to correctly answer sucha question in the curated situations (robot setting and plan) across fivedomains. A first analysis of the belief test yields extremely positive resultsinflating ones expectations of LLMs possessing ToM abilities. We then proposeand perform a suite of perturbation tests which breaks this illusion, i.e.Inconsistent Belief, Uninformative Context and Conviction Test. We concludethat, the high score of LLMs on vanilla prompts showcases its potential use inHRI settings, however to possess ToM demands invariance to trivial orirrelevant perturbations in the context which LLMs lack.</description><author>Mudit Verma, Siddhant Bhambri, Subbarao Kambhampati</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:09:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05302v1</guid></item><item><title>I am a Strange Dataset: Metalinguistic Tests for Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05300v1</link><description>Statements involving metalinguistic self-reference ("This paper has sixsections.") are prevalent in many domains. Can large language models (LLMs)handle such language? In this paper, we present "I am a Strange Dataset", a newdataset for addressing this question. There are two subtasks: generation andverification. In generation, models continue statements like "The penultimateword in this sentence is" (where a correct continuation is "is"). Inverification, models judge the truth of statements like "The penultimate wordin this sentence is sentence." (false). We also provide minimally differentmetalinguistic non-self-reference examples to complement the main dataset byprobing for whether models can handle metalinguistic language at all. Thedataset is hand-crafted by experts and validated by non-expert annotators. Wetest a variety of open-source LLMs (7B to 70B parameters) as well asclosed-source LLMs through APIs. All models perform close to chance across bothsubtasks and even on the non-self-referential metalinguistic control data,though we find some steady improvement with model scale. GPT 4 is the onlymodel to consistently do significantly better than chance, and it is still onlyin the 60% range, while our untrained human annotators score well in the 89-93%range.

However, thepresence of heterogeneous devices in federated learning, such as mobile phonesand IoT devices with varying memory capabilities, would limit the scale andhence the performance of the model could be trained. The mainstream approachesto address memory limitations focus on width-slimming techniques, wheredifferent clients train subnetworks with reduced widths locally and then theserver aggregates the subnetworks. The global model produced from these methodssuffers from performance degradation due to the negative impact of the actionstaken to handle the varying subnetwork widths in the aggregation phase. In thispaper, we introduce a memory-adaptive depth-wise learning solution in FL calledFeDepth, which adaptively decomposes the full model into blocks according tothe memory budgets of each client and trains blocks sequentially to obtain afull inference model. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,achieving 5% and more than 10% improvements in top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 andCIFAR-100, respectively. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of depth-wisefine-tuning on ViT.

Inparticular, attenuation and volume measures of muscle and fat are associatedwith important clinical outcomes, such as cardiovascular events, fractures, anddeath. This study evaluates the reliability of an Internal tool for thesegmentation of muscle and fat (subcutaneous and visceral) as compared to thewell-established public TotalSegmentator tool. Methods: We assessed the tools across 900 CT series from the publiclyavailable SAROS dataset, focusing on muscle, subcutaneous fat, and visceralfat. The Dice score was employed to assess accuracy in subcutaneous fat andmuscle segmentation. Due to the lack of ground truth segmentations for visceralfat, Cohen's Kappa was utilized to assess segmentation agreement between thetools. Results: Our Internal tool achieved a 3% higher Dice (83.8 vs. 80.8) forsubcutaneous fat and a 5% improvement (87.6 vs. 83.2) for muscle segmentationrespectively. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed that our results werestatistically different with p&lt;0.01. For visceral fat, the Cohen's kappa scoreof 0.856 indicated near-perfect agreement between the two tools. Our internaltool also showed very strong correlations for muscle volume (R^2=0.99), muscleattenuation (R^2=0.93), and subcutaneous fat volume (R^2=0.99) with a moderatecorrelation for subcutaneous fat attenuation (R^2=0.45). Conclusion: Our findings indicated that our Internal tool outperformedTotalSegmentator in measuring subcutaneous fat and muscle. The high Cohen'sKappa score for visceral fat suggests a reliable level of agreement between thetwo tools. These results demonstrate the potential of our tool in advancing theaccuracy of body composition analysis.</description><author>Benjamin Hou, Tejas Sudharshan Mathai, Jianfei Liu, Christopher Parnell, Ronald M.

Smart sensors are equipped withboth sensing and computation, and can either send raw measurements or processthem prior to transmission. Constrained agent resources raise a fundamentallatency-accuracy trade-off. On the one hand, raw measurements are inaccuratebut fast to produce. On the other hand, data processing on resource-constrainedplatforms generates accurate measurements at the cost of non-negligiblecomputation latency. Further, if processed data are also compressed, latencycaused by wireless communication might be higher for raw measurements. Hence,it is challenging to decide when and where sensors in the network shouldtransmit raw measurements or leverage time-consuming local processing. Totackle this design problem, we propose a Reinforcement Learning approach tolearn an efficient policy that dynamically decides when measurements are to beprocessed at each sensor. Effectiveness of our proposed approach is validatedthrough a numerical simulation with case study on smart sensing motivated bythe Internet of Drones.</description><author>Luca Ballotta, Giovanni Peserico, Francesco Zanini</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 17:50:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00703v5</guid></item><item><title>Bidirectional End-to-End Learning of Retriever-Reader Paradigm for Entity Linking</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12245v3</link><description>Entity Linking (EL) is a fundamental task for Information Extraction andKnowledge Graphs. The general form of EL (i.e., end-to-end EL) aims to firstfind mentions in the given input document and then link the mentions tocorresponding entities in a specific knowledge base. Recently, the paradigm ofretriever-reader promotes the progress of end-to-end EL, benefiting from theadvantages of dense entity retrieval and machine reading comprehension.However, the existing study only trains the retriever and the reader separatelyin a pipeline manner, which ignores the benefit that the interaction betweenthe retriever and the reader can bring to the task.

In thispaper, we develop Cheetah, a massively multilingual NLG language model forAfrican languages. Cheetah supports 517 African languages and languagevarieties, allowing us to address the scarcity of NLG resources and provide asolution to foster linguistic diversity. We demonstrate the effectiveness ofCheetah through comprehensive evaluations across six generation downstreamtasks. In five of the six tasks, Cheetah significantly outperforms othermodels, showcasing its remarkable performance for generating coherent andcontextually appropriate text in a wide range of African languages. Weadditionally conduct a detailed human evaluation to delve deeper into thelinguistic capabilities of Cheetah. The introduction of Cheetah hasfar-reaching benefits for linguistic diversity.

These are frequently used for security tasks and to port legacycode. However, they regularly generate difficult-to-read programs and require alarge amount of engineering effort to support new programming languages andISAs. Recent interest in neural approaches has produced portable tools thatgenerate readable code. However, to-date such techniques are usually restrictedto synthetic programs without optimization, and no models have evaluated theirportability. Furthermore, while the code generated may be more readable, it isusually incorrect. This paper presents SLaDe, a Small Language model Decompilerbased on a sequence-to-sequence transformer trained over real-world code. Wedevelop a novel tokenizer and exploit no-dropout training to producehigh-quality code. We utilize type-inference to generate programs that are morereadable and accurate than standard analytic and recent neural approaches.Unlike standard approaches, SLaDe can infer out-of-context types and unlikeneural approaches, it generates correct code. We evaluate SLaDe on over 4,000functions from AnghaBench on two ISAs and at two optimizations levels. SLaDe isup to 6 times more accurate than Ghidra, a state-of-the-art,industrial-strength decompiler and up to 4 times more accurate than the largelanguage model ChatGPT and generates significantly more readable code thanboth.</description><author>Jordi Armengol-Estapé, Jackson Woodruff, Chris Cummins, Michael F.

VQA Accuracy has beeneffective so far in the IID evaluation setting. However, our community isundergoing a shift towards open-ended generative models and OOD evaluation. Inthis new paradigm, the existing VQA Accuracy metric is overly stringent andunderestimates the performance of VQA systems. Thus, there is a need to developmore robust automatic VQA metrics that serve as a proxy for human judgment. Inthis work, we propose to leverage the in-context learning capabilities ofinstruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) to build a better VQA metric. Weformulate VQA evaluation as an answer-rating task where the LLM is instructedto score the accuracy of a candidate answer given a set of reference answers.We demonstrate the proposed metric better correlates with human judgmentcompared to existing metrics across several VQA models and benchmarks. We hopewide adoption of our metric will contribute to better estimating the researchprogress on the VQA task.

Despite the incessant exploration in this field, existing language agentsystems still struggle with costly, non-reproducible data reliance and face thechallenge of compelling a single model for multiple functions. To this end, weintroduce AutoAct, an automatic agent learning framework that does not rely onlarge-scale annotated data and synthetic trajectories from closed-source models(e.g., GPT-4). Given limited data with a tool library, AutoAct firstautomatically synthesizes planning trajectories without any assistance fromhumans or strong closed-source models. Then, AutoAct leverages adivision-of-labor strategy to automatically differentiate based on the targettask information and synthesized trajectories, producing a sub-agent group tocomplete the task. We conduct comprehensive experiments with different LLMs,which demonstrates that AutoAct yields better or parallel performance comparedto various strong baselines. We even notice that AutoAct, when using theLlama-2-13b model, can achieve performance comparable to that of theGPT-3.5-Turbo agent.

A major drawback ofsub-symbolic AI is that it acts as a "black box", meaning that predictions aredifficult to explain, making the testing &amp; evaluation (T&amp;E) and validation &amp;verification (V&amp;V) processes of a system that uses sub-symbolic AI a challenge.Since neurosymbolic AI combines the advantages of both symbolic andsub-symbolic AI, this survey explores how neurosymbolic applications can easethe V&amp;V process. This survey considers two taxonomies of neurosymbolic AI,evaluates them, and analyzes which algorithms are commonly used as the symbolicand sub-symbolic components in current applications. Additionally, an overviewof current techniques for the T&amp;E and V&amp;V processes of these components isprovided. Furthermore, it is investigated how the symbolic part is used for T&amp;Eand V&amp;V purposes in current neurosymbolic applications. Our research shows thatneurosymbolic AI as great potential to ease the T&amp;E and V&amp;V processes ofsub-symbolic AI by leveraging the possibilities of symbolic AI. Additionally,the applicability of current T&amp;E and V&amp;V methods to neurosymbolic AI isassessed, and how different neurosymbolic architectures can impact thesemethods is explored. It is found that current T&amp;E and V&amp;V techniques are partlysufficient to test, evaluate, verify, or validate the symbolic and sub-symbolicpart of neurosymbolic applications independently, while some of them useapproaches where current T&amp;E and V&amp;V methods are not applicable by default, andadjustments or even new approaches are needed.

Bayesian model comparison, i.e. the computation ofBayes factors or evidence ratios, can be cast as an optimization problem.Though the Bayesian interpretation of optimal classification is well-known,here we change perspective and present classes of loss functions that result infast, amortized neural estimators that directly estimate convenient functionsof the Bayes factor. This mitigates numerical inaccuracies associated withestimating individual model probabilities. We introduce the leaky parity-oddpower (l-POP) transform, leading to the novel ``l-POP-Exponential'' lossfunction. We explore neural density estimation for data probability indifferent models, showing it to be less accurate and scalable than EvidenceNetworks. Multiple real-world and synthetic examples illustrate that EvidenceNetworks are explicitly independent of dimensionality of the parameter spaceand scale mildly with the complexity of the posterior probability densityfunction. This simple yet powerful approach has broad implications for modelinference tasks. As an application of Evidence Networks to real-world data wecompute the Bayes factor for two models with gravitational lensing data of theDark Energy Survey.

This paper examines the differences between Twitter (X)in the United States and Sina Weibo posts in China on two primary dimensions ofaffect - valence and arousal. We study the difference in the functionalrelationship between arousal and valence (so-called V-shaped) among individualsin the US and China and explore the associated content differences.Furthermore, we correlate word usage and topics in both platforms to interprettheir differences. We observe that for Twitter users, the variation inemotional intensity is less distinct between negative and positive emotionscompared to Weibo users, and there is a sharper escalation in arousalcorresponding with heightened emotions. From language features, we discoverthat affective expressions are associated with personal life and feelings onTwitter, while on Weibo such discussions are about socio-political topics inthe society. These results suggest a West-East difference in the V-shapedrelationship between valence and arousal of affective expressions on socialmedia influenced by content differences.

In computer vision, CAM (Class Activation Map)-basedmethods and LRP (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation) method are two commonexplanation methods. However, since most CAM-based methods can only generateglobal weights, they can only generate coarse-grained explanations at a deeplayer. LRP and its variants, on the other hand, can generate fine-grainedexplanations. But the faithfulness of the explanations is too low. To addressthese challenges, in this paper, we propose FG-CAM (Fine-Grained CAM), whichextends CAM-based methods to enable generating fine-grained andhigh-faithfulness explanations. FG-CAM uses the relationship between twoadjacent layers of feature maps with resolution differences to graduallyincrease the explanation resolution, while finding the contributing pixels andfiltering out the pixels that do not contribute. Our method not only solves theshortcoming of CAM-based methods without changing their characteristics, butalso generates fine-grained explanations that have higher faithfulness than LRPand its variants. We also present FG-CAM with denoising, which is a variant ofFG-CAM and is able to generate less noisy explanations with almost no change inexplanation faithfulness. Experimental results show that the performance ofFG-CAM is almost unaffected by the explanation resolution. FG-CAM outperformsexisting CAM-based methods significantly in both shallow and intermediatelayers, and outperforms LRP and its variations significantly in the inputlayer.

However, their unique combination of graphicalelements (e.g., bars, lines) and textual components (e.g., labels, legends)poses challenges for general-purpose multimodal models. While vision-languagemodels trained on chart data excel in comprehension, they struggle withgeneralization and require task-specific fine-tuning. To address thesechallenges, we propose ChartAssistant, a chart-based vision-language model foruniversal chart comprehension and reasoning. ChartAssistant leverages ChartSFT,a comprehensive dataset covering diverse chart-related tasks with basic andspecialized chart types. It undergoes a two-stage training process, startingwith pre-training on chart-to-table parsing to align chart and text, followedby multitask instruction-following fine-tuning. This approach enablesChartAssistant to achieve competitive performance across various chart taskswithout task-specific fine-tuning.

To facilitate automatic controllerparametrization, this work presents a novel approach using deep reinforcementlearning (DRL) with N-dimensional B-spline geometries (BSGs). We focus on thecontrol of parameter-variant systems, a class of systems with complex behaviorwhich depends on the operating conditions. For this system class,gain-scheduling control structures are widely used in applications acrossindustries due to well-known design principles. Facilitating the expensivecontroller parametrization task regarding these control structures, we deployan DRL agent. Based on control system observations, the agent autonomouslydecides how to adapt the controller parameters. We make the adaptation processmore efficient by introducing BSGs to map the controller parameters which maydepend on numerous operating conditions. To preprocess time-series data andextract a fixed-length feature vector, we use a long short-term memory (LSTM)neural networks. Furthermore, this work contributes actor regularizations thatare relevant to real-world environments which differ from training.Accordingly, we apply dropout layer normalization to the actor and criticnetworks of the truncated quantile critic (TQC) algorithm.

However, existing approaches often havelimitations; some focus only on ranking patients by survivability, neglectingto estimate the actual event time, while others treat the problem as aclassification task, ignoring the inherent time-ordered structure of theevents. Furthermore, the effective utilization of censored samples - trainingdata points where the exact event time is unknown - is essential for improvingthe predictive accuracy of the model. In this paper, we introduce CenTime, anovel approach to survival analysis that directly estimates the time to event.Our method features an innovative event-conditional censoring mechanism thatperforms robustly even when uncensored data is scarce. We demonstrate that ourapproach forms a consistent estimator for the event model parameters, even inthe absence of uncensored data. Furthermore, CenTime is easily integrated withdeep learning models with no restrictions on batch size or the number ofuncensored samples. We compare our approach with standard survival analysismethods, including the Cox proportional-hazard model and DeepHit.

To tackle this task, existing worksoften train a classifier on data annotated by humans. However, annotating datais laborious, and annotations are often inconsistent due to subjectivecriteria. Motivated by the probability of sufficiency (PS) definition in thecausal literature, we propose CASA, a zero-shot causality-driven argumentsufficiency assessment framework. PS measures how likely introducing thepremise event would lead to the conclusion, when both the premise andconclusion events are absent. To estimate this probability, we propose to uselarge language models (LLMs) to generate contexts that are inconsistent withthe premise and conclusion, and revise them by injecting the premise event.Experiments on two logical fallacy detection datasets demonstrate that CASAaccurately identifies insufficient arguments.

However, this framework still requires acentralized global model to consolidate individual models into one, and thedevices train synchronously, which both can be potential bottlenecks for usingfederated learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method of asynchronousdecentralized federated lifelong learning (ADFLL) method that inherits themerits of federated learning and can train on multiple tasks simultaneouslywithout the need for a central node or synchronous training. Thus, overcomingthe potential drawbacks of conventional federated learning. We demonstrateexcellent performance on the brain tumor segmentation (BRATS) dataset forlocalizing the left ventricle on multiple image sequences and imageorientation. Our framework allows agents to achieve the best performance with amean distance error of 7.81, better than the conventional all-knowing agent'smean distance error of 11.78, and significantly (p=0.01) better than aconventional lifelong learning agent with a distance error of 15.17 after eightrounds of training.

The proposedstrategy combines the superior sampling of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methodwith computationally efficient gradient evaluations using Hamiltonian neuralnetworks. This combination is especially advantageous because the neuralnetwork architecture conserves the Hamiltonian, which defines the acceptancecriteria of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. Hence, this strategy achieveshigh acceptance rates at low computational cost. Our approach estimates smallfailure probabilities using Subset Simulations. However, in low-probabilitysample regions, the gradient evaluation is particularly challenging. Theremarkable accuracy of the proposed strategy is demonstrated on differentreliability problems, and its efficiency is compared to the traditionalHamiltonian Monte Carlo method. We note that this approach can reach itslimitations for gradient estimations in low-probability regions of complex andhigh-dimensional distributions. Thus, we propose techniques to improve gradientprediction in these particular situations and enable accurate estimations ofthe probability of failure. The highlight of this study is the reliabilityanalysis of a system whose parameter distributions must be inferred withBayesian inference problems. In such a case, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methodrequires a full model evaluation for each gradient evaluation and, therefore,comes at a very high cost. However, using Hamiltonian neural networks in thisframework replaces the expensive model evaluation, resulting in tremendousimprovements in computational efficiency.</description><author>Denny Thaler, Somayajulu L.

Our analysis offers fresh perspectives on the roles ofpessimism and optimism in off-line and on-line RL, and highlights theconnection between off-line RL and transfer learning.</description><author>Yaqi Duan, Martin J.

Oneway to obtain such models is to compress models, e.g. quantization. Another wayis a neural architecture search that automatically discovers new, moreefficient solutions. We propose a novel quantization-aware procedure, theQuantNAS that combines pros of these two approaches. To make QuantNAS work, theprocedure looks for quantization-friendly super-resolution models. The approachutilizes entropy regularization, quantization noise, and Adaptive Deviation forQuantization (ADQ) module to enhance the search procedure. The entropyregularization technique prioritizes a single operation within each block ofthe search space. Adding quantization noise to parameters and activationsapproximates model degradation after quantization, resulting in a morequantization-friendly architectures. ADQ helps to alleviate problems caused byBatch Norm blocks in super-resolution models. Our experimental results showthat the proposed approximations are better for search procedure than directmodel quantization. QuantNAS discovers architectures with better PSNR/BitOpstrade-off than uniform or mixed precision quantization of fixed architectures.We showcase the effectiveness of our method through its application to twosearch spaces inspired by the state-of-the-art SR models and RFDN. Thus, anyonecan design a proper search space based on an existing architecture and applyour method to obtain better quality and efficiency.

Furthermore, modality-specific encoders achieveimpressive performances in their respective domains. This raises a centralquestion: does an alignment exist between uni-modal vision and languageencoders since they fundamentally represent the same physical world? Analyzingthe latent spaces structure of vision and language models on image-captionbenchmarks using the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), we find that therepresentation spaces of unaligned and aligned encoders are semanticallysimilar. In the absence of statistical similarity in aligned encoders likeCLIP, we show that a possible matching of unaligned encoders exists without anytraining. We frame this as a seeded graph-matching problem exploiting thesemantic similarity between graphs and propose two methods - a Fast QuadraticAssignment Problem optimization, and a novel localized CKA metric-basedmatching/retrieval.

One type of solution is using detection models to detect tablecomponents, such as columns and rows, then applying a rule-basedpost-processing method to convert detection results into HTML sequences.However, existing detection-based models usually cannot perform as well asother types of solutions regarding cell-level TSR metrics, such as TEDS, andthe underlying reasons limiting the performance of these models on the TSR taskare also not well-explored. Therefore, we revisit existing detection-basedmodels comprehensively and explore the underlying reasons hindering thesemodels' performance, including the improper problem definition, the mismatchissue of detection and TSR metrics, the characteristics of detection models,and the impact of local and long-range features extraction. Based on ouranalysis and findings, we apply simple methods to tailor a typical two-stagedetection model, Cascade R-CNN, for the TSR task. The experimental results showthat the tailored Cascade R-CNN based model can improve the base Cascade R-CNNmodel by 16.35\% on the FinTabNet dataset regarding the structure-only TEDS,outperforming other types of state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that ourfindings can be a guideline for improving detection-based TSR models and that apurely detection-based solution is competitive with other types of solutions,such as graph-based and image-to-sequence solutions.</description><author>Bin Xiao, Murat Simsek, Burak Kantarci, Ala Abu Alkheir</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 15:51:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00699v2</guid></item><item><title>Optimizing Ego Vehicle Trajectory Prediction: The Graph Enhancement Approach</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13104v2</link><description>Predicting the trajectory of an ego vehicle is a critical component ofautonomous driving systems.

As isknown, 2D feature extraction and matching have already achieved great success.Unfortunately, in the field of 3D, the current methods may fail to support theextensive application of 3D LiDAR sensors in robotic vision tasks due to theirpoor descriptiveness and inefficiency. To address this limitation, we propose anovel 3D feature representation method: Linear Keypoints representation for 3DLiDAR point cloud, called LinK3D. The novelty of LinK3D lies in that it fullyconsiders the characteristics (such as the sparsity and complexity) of LiDARpoint clouds and represents the keypoint with its robust neighbor keypoints,which provide strong constraints in the description of the keypoint. Theproposed LinK3D has been evaluated on three public datasets, and theexperimental results show that our method achieves great matching performance.More importantly, LinK3D also shows excellent real-time performance, fasterthan the sensor frame rate at 10 Hz of a typical rotating LiDAR sensor. LinK3Donly takes an average of 30 milliseconds to extract features from the pointcloud collected by a 64-beam LiDAR and takes merely about 20 milliseconds tomatch two LiDAR scans when executed on a computer with an Intel Core i7processor. Moreover, our method can be extended to LiDAR odometry task, andshows good scalability.

Our main assumptionis that the candidate variables are observed in different environments whichmay, for example, correspond to different settings of a machine or differenttime intervals in a dynamical process. Under certain assumptions differentenvironments can be regarded as interventions on the observed system. We assumea linear relationship between target and covariates, which can be different ineach environment with the only restriction that the causal structure isinvariant across environments. This is an extension of the ICP($\textbf{I}$nvariant $\textbf{C}$ausal $\textbf{P}$rediction) principle byPeters et al. [2016], who assumed a fixed linear relationship across allenvironments. Within our proposed setting we provide sufficient conditions foridentifiability of the causal parents and introduce a practical method calledLoLICaP ($\textbf{Lo}$cally $\textbf{L}$inear $\textbf{I}$nvariant$\textbf{Ca}$usal $\textbf{P}$rediction), which is based on a hypothesis testfor parent identification using a ratio of minimum and maximum statistics. Wethen show in a simplified setting that the statistical power of LoLICaPconverges exponentially fast in the sample size, and finally we analyze thebehavior of LoLICaP experimentally in more general settings.</description><author>Alexander Mey, Rui Manuel Castro</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 15:34:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05218v1</guid></item><item><title>Exploring Vulnerabilities of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment Models: A Query-Based Black-Box Method</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05217v1</link><description>No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) aims to predict image qualityscores consistent with human perception without relying on pristine referenceimages, serving as a crucial component in various visual tasks. Ensuring therobustness of NR-IQA methods is vital for reliable comparisons of differentimage processing techniques and consistent user experiences in recommendations.The attack methods for NR-IQA provide a powerful instrument to test therobustness of NR-IQA. However, current attack methods of NR-IQA heavily rely onthe gradient of the NR-IQA model, leading to limitations when the gradientinformation is unavailable. In this paper, we present a pioneering query-basedblack box attack against NR-IQA methods. We propose the concept of \emph{scoreboundary} and leverage an adaptive iterative approach with multiple scoreboundaries. Meanwhile, the initial attack directions are also designed toleverage the characteristics of the Human Visual System (HVS). Experiments showour attack method outperforms all compared state-of-the-art methods and is farahead of previous black-box methods. The effective DBCNN model suffers aSpearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SROCC) decline of $0.6972$attacked by our method, revealing the vulnerability of NR-IQA to black-boxattacks.

However,imputation combined with dimensionality reduction can be computationallyexpensive, especially with the increasing size of datasets. To address thisissue, we propose a Blockwise principal component analysis Imputation (BPI)framework for dimensionality reduction and imputation of monotone missing data.The framework conducts Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the observed partof each monotone block of the data and then imputes on merging the obtainedprincipal components using a chosen imputation technique. BPI can work withvarious imputation techniques and can significantly reduce imputation timecompared to conducting dimensionality reduction after imputation. This makes ita practical and efficient approach for large datasets with monotone missingdata. Our experiments validate the improvement in speed. In addition, ourexperiments also show that while applying MICE imputation directly on missingdata may not yield convergence, applying BPI with MICE for the data may lead toconvergence.</description><author>Tu T.

Recognizingtheir importance, the field of explainable AI (XAI) provides several techniquesto generate these explanations. Yet, there is relatively little emphasis on theuser (the explainee) in this growing body of work and most XAI techniquesgenerate "one-size-fits-all" explanations. To bridge this gap and achieve astep closer towards human-centered XAI, we present I-CEE, a framework thatprovides Image Classification Explanations tailored to User Expertise. Informedby existing work, I-CEE explains the decisions of image classification modelsby providing the user with an informative subset of training data (i.e.,example images), corresponding local explanations, and model decisions.However, unlike prior work, I-CEE models the informativeness of the exampleimages to depend on user expertise, resulting in different examples fordifferent users. We posit that by tailoring the example set to user expertise,I-CEE can better facilitate users' understanding and simulatability of themodel. To evaluate our approach, we conduct detailed experiments in bothsimulation and with human participants (N = 100) on multiple datasets.Experiments with simulated users show that I-CEE improves users' ability toaccurately predict the model's decisions (simulatability) compared tobaselines, providing promising preliminary results.

In order to address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel genericframework to learn the representation of spatial networks that are embedded innon-Euclidean manifold space. Specifically, a novel message-passing-basedneural network is proposed to combine graph topology and spatial geometry,where spatial geometry is extracted as messages on the edges.

In contrast to establishednumerical approximation schemes such as Runge-Kutta methods, the estimation ofthe error of the NN-based approximations proves to be difficult. In this work,we propose to use the NN's predictions in a high-order implicit Runge-Kutta(IRK) method. The residuals in the implicit system of equations can be relatedto the NN's prediction error, hence, we can provide an error estimate atseveral points along a trajectory. We find that this error estimate highlycorrelates with the NN's prediction error and that increasing the order of theIRK method improves this estimate.

In particular, LiDARprovides the opportunity to map forest leaf area with unprecedented accuracy,while leaf area has remained an important source of uncertainty affectingmodels of gas exchanges between the vegetation and the atmosphere. UnmannedAerial Vehicles (UAV) are easy to mobilize and therefore allow frequentrevisits to track the response of vegetation to climate change. However,miniature sensors embarked on UAVs usually provide point clouds of limiteddensity, which are further affected by a strong decrease in density from top tobottom of the canopy due to progressively stronger occlusion. In such acontext, discriminating leaf points from wood points presents a significantchallenge due in particular to strong class imbalance and spatially irregularsampling intensity. Here we introduce a neural network model based on thePointnet ++ architecture which makes use of point geometry only (excluding anyspectral information). To cope with local data sparsity, we propose aninnovative sampling scheme which strives to preserve local important geometricinformation. We also propose a loss function adapted to the severe classimbalance. We show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives onUAV point clouds.

Data-driven short-term load forecasting (STLF), although promising,has suffered from a lack of open, large-scale datasets with high buildingdiversity. This has hindered exploring the pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm forSTLF. To help address this, we present BuildingsBench, which consists of: 1)Buildings-900K, a large-scale dataset of 900K simulated buildings representingthe U.S. building stock; and 2) an evaluation platform with over 1,900 realresidential and commercial buildings from 7 open datasets. BuildingsBenchbenchmarks two under-explored tasks: zero-shot STLF, where a pretrained modelis evaluated on unseen buildings without fine-tuning, and transfer learning,where a pretrained model is fine-tuned on a target building. The main findingof our benchmark analysis is that synthetically pretrained models generalizesurprisingly well to real commercial buildings. An exploration of the effect ofincreasing dataset size and diversity on zero-shot commercial buildingperformance reveals a power-law with diminishing returns. We also show thatfine-tuning pretrained models on real commercial and residential buildingsimproves performance for a majority of target buildings. We hope thatBuildingsBench encourages and facilitates future research on generalizableSTLF.

For the ground truth, we showed that a thoughtful merging of thescores of the observers could improve intra-observer reliability and agreement.We showed that including multiple locomotion traits improves the classificationaccuracy from 76.6% with only one trait to 79.9% with the three most importanttraits and to 80.1% with all six locomotion traits.</description><author>Helena Russello, Rik van der Tol, Menno Holzhauer, Eldert J. van Henten, Gert Kootstra</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 14:56:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05202v1</guid></item><item><title>A Unified Framework for U-Net Design and Analysis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19638v2</link><description>U-Nets are a go-to, state-of-the-art neural architecture across numeroustasks for continuous signals on a square such as images and PartialDifferential Equations (PDE), however their design and architecture isunderstudied.

In settings where there is a significant overheadto deploying adaptive algorithms -- for example, when the execution of the datacollection policies is required to be distributed, or a human in the loop isneeded to implement these policies -- producing in advance a set of policiesfor data collection is paramount. We study the setting where a large dataset ofcontexts but not rewards is available and may be used by the learner to designan effective data collection strategy. Although when rewards are linear thisproblem has been well studied, results are still missing for more complexreward models. In this work we propose two experiment planning strategiescompatible with function approximation. The first is an eluder planning andsampling procedure that can recover optimality guarantees depending on theeluder dimension of the reward function class. For the second, we show that auniform sampler achieves competitive optimality rates in the setting where thenumber of actions is small. We finalize our results introducing a statisticalgap fleshing out the fundamental differences between planning and adaptivelearning and provide results for planning with model selection.</description><author>Aldo Pacchiano, Jonathan N.

However, current works all process data uniformly without consideringthe problem-solving difficulty, which means an excessive focus on simplequestions while insufficient to intricate ones. To address this challenge, weinspired by humans using heuristic strategies to categorize tasks and handlethem individually, propose to apply the Divide and Conquer to LLMs reasoning.First, we divide questions into different subsets based on the statisticalconfidence score ($\mathcal{CS}$), then fix nearly resolved sets and conquerdemanding nuanced process ones with elaborately designed methods, includingPrior Knowledge based Reasoning (PKR) and Filter Choices based Reasoning (FCR),as well as their integration variants. Our experiments demonstrate that thisproposed strategy significantly boosts the models' reasoning abilities acrossnine datasets involving arithmetic, commonsense, and logic tasks. For instance,compared to baseline, we make a striking improvement on low confidence subsetsof 8.72\% for AQuA, 15.07\% for ARC Challenge and 7.71\% for RiddleSense. Inaddition, through extensive analysis on length of rationale and number ofoptions, we verify that longer reasoning paths in PKR could prevent models fromreferring infer-harmful shortcuts, and also find that removing irrelevantchoices in FCR would substantially avoid models' confusion.

Machine Learning (ML) shows great potential fortrust evaluation owing to its learning capabilities. In recent years, GraphNeural Networks (GNNs), as a new ML paradigm, have demonstrated superiority indealing with graph data. This has motivated researchers to explore their use intrust evaluation, as trust relationships among entities can be modeled as agraph. However, current trust evaluation methods that employ GNNs fail to fullysatisfy the dynamic nature of trust, overlook the adverse effects oftrust-related attacks, and cannot provide convincing explanations on evaluationresults. To address these problems, we propose TrustGuard, a GNN-based accuratetrust evaluation model that supports trust dynamicity, is robust againsttypical attacks, and provides explanations through visualization. Specifically,TrustGuard is designed with a layered architecture that contains a snapshotinput layer, a spatial aggregation layer, a temporal aggregation layer, and aprediction layer. Among them, the spatial aggregation layer adopts a defensemechanism to robustly aggregate local trust, and the temporal aggregation layerapplies an attention mechanism for effective learning of temporal patterns.Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that TrustGuardoutperforms state-of-the-art GNN-based trust evaluation models with respect totrust prediction across single-timeslot and multi-timeslot, even in thepresence of attacks. In addition, TrustGuard can explain its evaluation resultsby visualizing both spatial and temporal views.</description><author>Jie Wang, Zheng Yan, Jiahe Lan, Elisa Bertino, Witold Pedrycz</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 14:26:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13339v3</guid></item><item><title>Can ChatGPT Rival Neural Machine Translation?

Due to the absence ofhigh-resolution MS images, available deep-learning-based methods usually followthe paradigm of training at reduced resolution and testing at both reduced andfull resolution. When taking original MS and PAN images as inputs, they alwaysobtain sub-optimal results due to the scale variation. In this paper, wepropose to explore the self-supervised representation of pansharpening bydesigning a cross-predictive diffusion model, named CrossDiff. It has two-stagetraining. In the first stage, we introduce a cross-predictive pretext task topre-train the UNet structure based on conditional DDPM, while in the secondstage, the encoders of the UNets are frozen to directly extract spatial andspectral features from PAN and MS, and only the fusion head is trained to adaptfor pansharpening task. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness andsuperiority of the proposed model compared with state-of-the-art supervised andunsupervised methods. Besides, the cross-sensor experiments also verify thegeneralization ability of proposed self-supervised representation learners forother satellite's datasets. We will release our code for reproducibility.</description><author>Yinghui Xing, Litao Qu, ShiZhou Zhang, Xiuwei Zhang, Yanning Zhang</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 13:32:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05153v1</guid></item><item><title>Federated Unlearning: A Survey on Methods, Design Guidelines, and Evaluation Metrics</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05146v1</link><description>Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of a Machine Learning(ML) model across multiple parties, facilitating the preservation of users' andinstitutions' privacy by keeping data stored locally. Instead of centralizingraw data, FL exchanges locally refined model parameters to build a global modelincrementally. While FL is more compliant with emerging regulations such as theEuropean General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ensuring the right to beforgotten in this context - allowing FL participants to remove their datacontributions from the learned model - remains unclear. In addition, it isrecognized that malicious clients may inject backdoors into the global modelthrough updates, e.g. to generate mispredictions on specially crafted dataexamples. Consequently, there is the need for mechanisms that can guaranteeindividuals the possibility to remove their data and erase maliciouscontributions even after aggregation, without compromising the already acquired"good" knowledge. This highlights the necessity for novel Federated Unlearning(FU) algorithms, which can efficiently remove specific clients' contributionswithout full model retraining. This survey provides background concepts,empirical evidence, and practical guidelines to design/implement efficient FUschemes. Our study includes a detailed analysis of the metrics for evaluatingunlearning in FL and presents an in-depth literature review categorizingstate-of-the-art FU contributions under a novel taxonomy.

However,this information is unavailable in the real world. Therefore, we focus on amore realistic and challenging setting, named hard-label attack, in which theattacker can only query the model and obtain a discrete prediction label.Existing hard-label attack algorithms tend to initialize adversarial examplesby random substitution and then utilize complex heuristic algorithms tooptimize the adversarial perturbation. These methods require a lot of modelqueries and the attack success rate is restricted by adversary initialization.In this paper, we propose a novel hard-label attack algorithm named LimeAttack,which leverages a local explainable method to approximate word importanceranking, and then adopts beam search to find the optimal solution. Extensiveexperiments show that LimeAttack achieves the better attacking performancecompared with existing hard-label attack under the same query budget. Inaddition, we evaluate the effectiveness of LimeAttack on large language models,and results indicate that adversarial examples remain a significant threat tolarge language models. The adversarial examples crafted by LimeAttack arehighly transferable and effectively improve model robustness in adversarialtraining.</description><author>Hai Zhu, Zhaoqing Yang, Weiwei Shang, Yuren Wu</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 13:26:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00319v2</guid></item><item><title>Machine Learning to Promote Translational Research: Predicting Patent and Clinical Trial Inclusion in Dementia Research</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05145v1</link><description>Projected to impact 1.6 million people in the UK by 2040 and costing{\pounds}25 billion annually, dementia presents a growing challenge to society.This study, a pioneering effort to predict the translational potential ofdementia research using machine learning, hopes to address the slow translationof fundamental discoveries into practical applications despite dementia'ssignificant societal and economic impact.

Traditionally, DR is monitored using Color FundusPhotography (CFP), a widespread 2-D imaging modality. However, DRclassifications based on CFP have poor predictive power, resulting insuboptimal DR management. Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is arecent 3-D imaging modality offering enhanced structural and functionalinformation (blood flow) with a wider field of view. This paper investigatesautomatic DR severity assessment using 3-D OCTA. A straightforward solution tothis task is a 3-D neural network classifier. However, 3-D architectures havenumerous parameters and typically require many training samples. A lightersolution consists in using 2-D neural network classifiers processing 2-Den-face (or frontal) projections and/or 2-D cross-sectional slices. Such anapproach mimics the way ophthalmologists analyze OCTA acquisitions: 1) en-faceflow maps are often used to detect avascular zones and neovascularization, and2) cross-sectional slices are commonly analyzed to detect macular edemas, forinstance. However, arbitrary data reduction or selection might result ininformation loss. Two complementary strategies are thus proposed to optimallysummarize OCTA volumes with 2-D images: 1) a parametric en-face projectionoptimized through deep learning and 2) a cross-sectional slice selectionprocess controlled through gradient-based attribution. The full summarizationand DR classification pipeline is trained from end to end. The automatic 2-Dsummary can be displayed in a viewer or printed in a report to support thedecision. We show that the proposed 2-D summarization and classificationpipeline outperforms direct 3-D classification with the advantage of improvedinterpretability.</description><author>Mostafa El Habib Daho, Yihao Li, Rachid Zeghlache, Hugo Le Boité, Pierre Deman, Laurent Borderie, Hugang Ren, Niranchana Mannivanan, Capucine Lepicard, Béatrice Cochener, Aude Couturier, Ramin Tadayoni, Pierre-Henri Conze, Mathieu Lamard, Gwenolé Quellec</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 13:06:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05137v1</guid></item><item><title>Deep learning in medical image registration: introduction and survey</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00727v2</link><description>Image registration (IR) is a process that deforms images to align them withrespect to a reference space, making it easier for medical practitioners toexamine various medical images in a standardized reference frame, such ashaving the same rotation and scale.

We propose a newsemi-supervised learning method, Semantic Positives via Pseudo-Labels (SemPPL),that combines labelled and unlabelled data to learn informativerepresentations. Our method extends self-supervised contrastive learning --where representations are shaped by distinguishing whether two samplesrepresent the same underlying datum (positives) or not (negatives) -- with anovel approach to selecting positives. To enrich the set of positives, weleverage the few existing ground-truth labels to predict the missing onesthrough a $k$-nearest neighbours classifier by using the learned embeddings ofthe labelled data. We thus extend the set of positives with datapoints havingthe same pseudo-label and call these semantic positives. We jointly learn therepresentation and predict bootstrapped pseudo-labels. This creates areinforcing cycle. Strong initial representations enable better pseudo-labelpredictions which then improve the selection of semantic positives and lead toeven better representations. SemPPL outperforms competing semi-supervisedmethods setting new state-of-the-art performance of $68.5\%$ and $76\%$ top-$1$accuracy when using a ResNet-$50$ and training on $1\%$ and $10\%$ of labels onImageNet, respectively.

Towards Multi-modal Medical Consultation Concern Summary Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05134v1</link><description>Over the past few years, the use of the Internet for healthcare-related taskshas grown by leaps and bounds, posing a challenge in effectively managing andprocessing information to ensure its efficient utilization. During moments ofemotional turmoil and psychological challenges, we frequently turn to theinternet as our initial source of support, choosing this over discussing ourfeelings with others due to the associated social stigma. In this paper, wepropose a new task of multi-modal medical concern summary (MMCS) generation,which provides a short and precise summary of patients' major concerns broughtup during the consultation. Nonverbal cues, such as patients' gestures andfacial expressions, aid in accurately identifying patients' concerns. Doctorsalso consider patients' personal information, such as age and gender, in orderto describe the medical condition appropriately. Motivated by the potentialefficacy of patients' personal context and visual gestures, we propose atransformer-based multi-task, multi-modal intent-recognition, and medicalconcern summary generation (IR-MMCSG) system. Furthermore, we propose amultitasking framework for intent recognition and medical concern summarygeneration for doctor-patient consultations. We construct the first multi-modalmedical concern summary generation (MM-MediConSummation) corpus, which includespatient-doctor consultations annotated with medical concern summaries, intents,patient personal information, doctor's recommendations, and keywords. Ourexperiments and analysis demonstrate (a) the significant role of patients'expressions/gestures and their personal information in intent identificationand medical concern summary generation, and (b) the strong correlation betweenintent recognition and patients' medical concern summary generation The dataset and source code are available at https://github.com/NLP-RL/MMCSG.</description><author>Abhisek Tiwari, Shreyangshu Bera, Sriparna Saha, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Samrat Ghosh</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 12:56:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05134v1</guid></item><item><title>Neural Population Learning beyond Symmetric Zero-sum Games</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05133v1</link><description>We study computationally efficient methods for finding equilibria in n-playergeneral-sum games, specifically ones that afford complex visuomotor skills.

A popular approach to the task are name-based methods,i.e. those identifying the most appropriate name in the KB for a given mention,either via dense retrieval or autoregressive modeling. However, as thesemethods directly return KB names, they cannot cope with homonyms, i.e.different KB entities sharing the exact same name. This significantly affectstheir performance, especially for KBs where homonyms account for a large amountof entity mentions (e.g. UMLS and NCBI Gene). We therefore present BELHD(Biomedical Entity Linking with Homonym Disambiguation), a new name-basedmethod that copes with this challenge. Specifically, BELHD builds upon theBioSyn (Sung et al.,2020) model introducing two crucial extensions. First, itperforms a preprocessing of the KB in which it expands homonyms with anautomatically chosen disambiguating string, thus enforcing unique linkingdecisions. Second, we introduce candidate sharing, a novel strategy to selectcandidates for contrastive learning that enhances the overall training signal.Experiments with 10 corpora and five entity types show that BELHD improves uponstate-of-the-art approaches, achieving the best results in 6 out 10 corporawith an average improvement of 4.55pp recall@1. Furthermore, the KBpreprocessing is orthogonal to the core prediction model and thus can alsoimprove other methods, which we exemplify for GenBioEL (Yuan et al, 2022), agenerative name-based BEL approach.

In particular, with the exponentially increasingsizes of ML models, photonics-based accelerators are getting special attentionas a sustainable solution because they can perform ML inferences with multipleorders of magnitude higher energy efficiency than CMOS-based accelerators.However, recent studies have shown that hardware manufacturing andinfrastructure contribute significantly to the carbon footprint of computingdevices, even surpassing the emissions generated during their use. For example,the manufacturing process accounts for 74% of the total carbon emissions fromApple in 2019. This prompts us to ask -- if we consider both the embodied(manufacturing) and operational carbon cost of photonics, is it indeed a viableavenue for a sustainable future? So, in this paper, we build a carbon footprintmodel for photonic chips and investigate the sustainability of photonics-basedaccelerators by conducting a case study on ADEPT, a photonics-based acceleratorfor deep neural network inference.

The current alignment of AI systems primarilyfocuses on passively aligning LLMs through human intervention. However, agentspossess characteristics like receiving environmental feedback andself-evolution, rendering the LLM alignment methods inadequate. In response, wepropose an evolutionary framework for agent evolution and alignment, namedEvolutionaryAgent, which transforms agent alignment into a process of evolutionand selection under the principle of survival of the fittest. In an environmentwhere social norms continuously evolve, agents better adapted to the currentsocial norms will have a higher probability of survival and proliferation,while those inadequately aligned dwindle over time. Experimental resultsassessing the agents from multiple perspectives in aligning with social normsdemonstrate that EvolutionaryAgent possesses the capability to alignprogressively better with the evolving social norms while maintaining itsproficiency in general tasks. Effectiveness tests conducted on various open andclosed-source LLMs as the foundation for agents also prove the applicability ofour approach.</description><author>Shimin Li, Tianxiang Sun, Xipeng Qiu</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 12:30:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04620v2</guid></item><item><title>Unpacking Human-AI interactions: From interaction primitives to a design space</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05115v1</link><description>This paper aims to develop a semi-formal design space for Human-AIinteractions, by building a set of interaction primitives which specify thecommunication between users and AI systems during their interaction. We showhow these primitives can be combined into a set of interaction patterns whichcan provide an abstract specification for exchanging messages between humansand AI/ML models to carry out purposeful interactions. The motivation behindthis is twofold: firstly, to provide a compact generalisation of existingpractices, that highlights the similarities and differences between systems interms of their interaction behaviours; and secondly, to support the creation ofnew systems, in particular by opening the space of possibilities forinteractions with models. We present a short literature review on frameworks,guidelines and taxonomies related to the design and implementation of HAIinteractions, including human-in-the-loop, explainable AI, as well as hybridintelligence and collaborative learning approaches. From the literature review,we define a vocabulary for describing information exchanges in terms ofproviding and requesting particular model-specific data types. Based on thisvocabulary, a message passing model for interactions between humans and modelsis presented, which we demonstrate can account for existing systems andapproaches. Finally, we build this into design patterns as mid-level constructsthat capture common interactional structures. We discuss how this approach canbe used towards a design space for Human-AI interactions that creates newpossibilities for designs as well as keeping track of implementation issues andconcerns.</description><author>Kostas Tsiakas, Dave Murray-Rust</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 12:27:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05115v1</guid></item><item><title>A Theoretical View of Linear Backpropagation and Its Convergence</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11018v2</link><description>Backpropagation (BP) is widely used for calculating gradients in deep neuralnetworks (DNNs). Applied often along with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) orits variants, BP is considered as a de-facto choice in a variety of machinelearning tasks including DNN training and adversarial attack/defense. Recently,a linear variant of BP named LinBP was introduced for generating moretransferable adversarial examples for performing black-box attacks, by Guo etal. Although it has been shown empirically effective in black-box attacks,theoretical studies and convergence analyses of such a method is lacking. Thispaper serves as a complement and somewhat an extension to Guo et al.'s paper,by providing theoretical analyses on LinBP in neural-network-involved learningtasks, including adversarial attack and model training. We demonstrate that,somewhat surprisingly, LinBP can lead to faster convergence in these tasks inthe same hyper-parameter settings, compared to BP.

This requiresactor-specific pose estimation (e.g., humans vs. animals), leading tocumbersome model design complexity and high maintenance costs. Moreover, theyoften focus on learning the visual modality alone and single-labelclassification whilst neglecting other available information sources (e.g.,class name text) and the concurrent occurrence of multiple actions. To overcomethese limitations, we propose a new approach called 'actor-agnostic multi-modalmulti-label action recognition,' which offers a unified solution for varioustypes of actors, including humans and animals. We further formulate a novelMulti-modal Semantic Query Network (MSQNet) model in a transformer-based objectdetection framework (e.g., DETR), characterized by leveraging visual andtextual modalities to represent the action classes better. The elimination ofactor-specific model designs is a key advantage, as it removes the need foractor pose estimation altogether. Extensive experiments on five publiclyavailable benchmarks show that our MSQNet consistently outperforms the priorarts of actor-specific alternatives on human and animal single- and multi-labelaction recognition tasks by up to 50%.
