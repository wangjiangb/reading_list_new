Following themost popular and effective paradigm in this field, which incorporates a neuralradiance field (NeRF) into the generator of a generative adversarial network(GAN), we build a well-structured codebase, dubbed Carver, through modularizingthe generation process. Such a design allows researchers to develop and replaceeach module independently, and hence offers an opportunity to fairly comparevarious approaches and recognize their contributions from the moduleperspective. The reproduction of a range of cutting-edge algorithmsdemonstrates the availability of our modularized codebase. We also perform avariety of in-depth analyses, such as the comparison across different types ofpoint feature, the necessity of the tailing upsampler in the generator, thereliance on the camera pose prior, etc., which deepen our understanding ofexisting methods and point out some further directions of the research work.

We focus on occupation-related gender biases, inspiredby Winograd and Winogender schemas, where each image is associated with acaption containing a pronoun relationship of subjects and objects in the scene.VisoGender is balanced by gender representation in professional roles,supporting bias evaluation in two ways: i) resolution bias, where we evaluatethe difference between gender resolution accuracies for men and women and ii)retrieval bias, where we compare ratios of male and female professionalsretrieved for a gender-neutral search query. We benchmark severalstate-of-the-art vision-language models and find that they lack the reasoningabilities to correctly resolve gender in complex scenes. While the directionand magnitude of gender bias depends on the task and the model being evaluated,captioning models generally are more accurate and less biased than CLIP-likemodels.

However, theresultant 3D models exhibit two limitations: (a) quality concerns such assaturated color and the Janus problem; (b) extremely low diversity comparing totext-guided image synthesis. In this paper, we show that the conflict betweenNeRF optimization process and uniform timestep sampling in score distillationis the main reason for these limitations. To resolve this conflict, we proposeto prioritize timestep sampling with monotonically non-increasing functions,which aligns NeRF optimization with the sampling process of diffusion model.Extensive experiments show that our simple redesign significantly improvestext-to-3D content creation with higher quality and diversity.</description><author>Yukun Huang, Jianan Wang, Yukai Shi, Xianbiao Qi, Zheng-Jun Zha, Lei Zhang</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 18:59:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12422v1</guid></item><item><title>LMFlow: An Extensible Toolkit for Finetuning and Inference of Large Foundation Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12420v1</link><description>Large foundation models have demonstrated a great ability to achieve generalhuman-level intelligence far beyond traditional approaches. As the techniquekeeps attracting attention from the AI community, more and more largefoundation models have become publically available. However, most of thosemodels exhibit a major deficiency in specialized-task applications, where thestep of finetuning is still required for obtaining satisfactory performance. Asthe number of available models and specialized tasks keeps growing, the job ofgeneral finetuning becomes highly nontrivial. In this paper, we take the firststep to address this issue. We introduce an extensible and lightweight toolkit,LMFlow, which aims to simplify the finetuning and inference of general largefoundation models. LMFlow offers a complete finetuning workflow for a largefoundation model to support personalized training with limited computingresources. Furthermore, it supports continuous pretraining, instruction tuning,parameter-efficient finetuning, alignment tuning, and large model inference,along with carefully designed and extensible APIs. This toolkit has beenthoroughly tested and is available at https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow.</description><author>Shizhe Diao, Rui Pan, Hanze Dong, Ka Shun Shum, Jipeng Zhang, Wei Xiong, Tong Zhang</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 18:58:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12420v1</guid></item><item><title>The False Dawn: Reevaluating Google's Reinforcement Learning for Chip Macro Placement</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09633v3</link><description>Reinforcement learning (RL) for physical design of silicon chips in a Google2021 Nature paper stirred controversy due to poorly documented claims thatraised eyebrows and attracted critical media coverage.

This paper is motivated by the specific case ofcollisions between two rigid or deformable bodies and the intrinsic nature ofthat discontinuity. The impulse response to a collision is discontinuous withthe lack of any response when no collision occurs, which causes difficultiesfor numerical approaches that require differentiability which are typical inmachine learning, inverse problems, and control. We theoretically andnumerically demonstrate that the derivative of the collision time with respectto the parameters becomes infinite as one approaches the barrier separatingcolliding from not colliding, and use lifting to complexify the solution spaceso that solutions on the other side of the barrier are directly attainable asprecise values. Subsequently, we mollify the barrier posed by the unboundedderivatives, so that one can tunnel back and forth in a smooth and reliablefashion facilitating the use of standard numerical approaches. Moreover, weillustrate that standard approaches fail in numerous ways mostly due to a lackof understanding of the mathematical nature of the problem (e.g. typicalbackpropagation utilizes many rules of differentiation, but ignores L'Hopital'srule).</description><author>Daniel Johnson, Ronald Fedkiw</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 18:51:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12413v1</guid></item><item><title>PATCorrect: Non-autoregressive Phoneme-augmented Transformer for ASR Error Correction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05040v2</link><description>Speech-to-text errors made by automatic speech recognition (ASR) systemsnegatively impact downstream models.

We demonstrate that PATCorrect consistentlyoutperforms state-of-the-art NAR method on English corpus across differentupstream ASR systems, with an overall 11.62% WER reduction (WERR) compared to9.46% WERR achieved by other methods using text only modality.

The clients exchange the trained parameterswith their corresponding edge servers, which update the locally aggregatedmodel. This model is then transmitted to all the clients in the local cluster.The edge servers communicate to the central cloud server for global modelaggregation. The goal of each client is to converge to the global model, whilemaintaining timeliness of the clients, i.e., having optimum training iterationtime. We investigate the convergence criteria for such a system with denseclusters. Our analysis shows that for a system of $n$ clients with fixedaverage timeliness, the convergence in finite time is probabilisticallyguaranteed, if the nodes are divided into $O(1)$ number of clusters, that is,if the system is built as a sparse set of edge servers with dense client baseseach.</description><author>Purbesh Mitra, Sennur Ulukus</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 18:39:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12400v1</guid></item><item><title>Multi-Task Consistency for Active Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12398v1</link><description>Learning-based solutions for vision tasks require a large amount of labeledtraining data to ensure their performance and reliability. In single-taskvision-based settings, inconsistency-based active learning has proven to beeffective in selecting informative samples for annotation. However, there is alack of research exploiting the inconsistency between multiple tasks inmulti-task networks. To address this gap, we propose a novel multi-task activelearning strategy for two coupled vision tasks: object detection and semanticsegmentation. Our approach leverages the inconsistency between them to identifyinformative samples across both tasks. We propose three constraints thatspecify how the tasks are coupled and introduce a method for determining thepixels belonging to the object detected by a bounding box, to later quantifythe constraints as inconsistency scores. To evaluate the effectiveness of ourapproach, we establish multiple baselines for multi-task active learning andintroduce a new metric, mean Detection Segmentation Quality (mDSQ), tailoredfor the multi-task active learning comparison that addresses the performance ofboth tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on the nuImages and A9 datasets,demonstrating that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methodsby up to 3.4% mDSQ on nuImages. Our approach achieves 95% of the fully-trainedperformance using only 67% of the available data, corresponding to 20% fewerlabels compared to random selection and 5% fewer labels compared tostate-of-the-art selection strategy. Our code will be made publicly availableafter the review process.</description><author>Aral Hekimoglu, Philipp Friedrich, Walter Zimmer, Michael Schmidt, Alvaro Marcos-Ramiro, Alois C.

Their full potential has not yet been reached as most arechallenging to learn and exist in isolation. Recently, large-language models(LLMs) have shown strong performance in tasks across domains, but struggle withchemistry-related problems. Moreover, these models lack access to externalknowledge sources, limiting their usefulness in scientific applications. Inthis study, we introduce ChemCrow, an LLM chemistry agent designed toaccomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materialsdesign. By integrating 17 expert-designed tools, ChemCrow augments the LLMperformance in chemistry, and new capabilities emerge. Our agent autonomouslyplanned the syntheses of an insect repellent, three organocatalysts, as well asother relevant molecules. Our evaluation, including both LLM and expertassessments, demonstrates ChemCrow's effectiveness in automating a diverse setof chemical tasks. Surprisingly, we find that GPT-4 as an evaluator cannotdistinguish between clearly wrong GPT-4 completions and Chemcrow's performance.There is a significant risk of misuse of tools like ChemCrow, and we discusstheir potential harms. Employed responsibly, our work not only aids expertchemists and lowers barriers for non-experts, but also fosters scientificadvancement by bridging the gap between experimental and computationalchemistry.

Weinfer the 3D mesh of each object in the environment using shape warping, atechnique for aligning point clouds across object instances. Then, we representmanipulation actions as keypoints on objects, which can be warped with theshape of the object.

Theprioritization process offers a parity among the requirements based on multiplecharacteristics, including end-users' preferences, cost to implement, andtechnical dependencies. This paper presents an interactive method torequirements prioritization that leverages the pairwise comparisons and aconstraint solver. Our method employs an interactive accumulation of knowledgefrom the requirements analyst when the relative priority among the requirementscannot be determined based on the existing knowledge from the requirementsdocuments. The final ranking of the requirements is produced via the constraintsolver and interactive pairwise comparisons. We evaluate the proposed methodusing the requirements from a real healthcare project. The proposedprioritization method relying on a constraint solver outperformsstate-of-the-art interactive prioritization methods in terms of effectivenessand robustness to analyst's errors.</description><author>Jonathan Winton, Francis Palma</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 18:24:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12391v1</guid></item><item><title>MARBLE: Music Audio Representation Benchmark for Universal Evaluation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10548v2</link><description>In the era of extensive intersection between art and Artificial Intelligence(AI), such as image generation and fiction co-creation, AI for music remainsrelatively nascent, particularly in music understanding. This is evident in thelimited work on deep music representations, the scarcity of large-scaledatasets, and the absence of a universal and community-driven benchmark. Toaddress this issue, we introduce the Music Audio Representation Benchmark foruniversaL Evaluation, termed MARBLE. It aims to provide a benchmark for variousMusic Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks by defining a comprehensive taxonomywith four hierarchy levels, including acoustic, performance, score, andhigh-level description. We then establish a unified protocol based on 14 taskson 8 public-available datasets, providing a fair and standard assessment ofrepresentations of all open-sourced pre-trained models developed on musicrecordings as baselines. Besides, MARBLE offers an easy-to-use, extendable, andreproducible suite for the community, with a clear statement on copyrightissues on datasets. Results suggest recently proposed large-scale pre-trainedmusical language models perform the best in most tasks, with room for furtherimprovement.

In this paper, we show that game optimization shares dynamicproperties with particle systems subject to multiple forces, and one canleverage tools from physics to improve optimization dynamics. Inspired by thephysical framework, we propose LEAD, an optimizer for min-max games. Next,using Lyapunov stability theory and spectral analysis, we study LEAD'sconvergence properties in continuous and discrete time settings for a class ofquadratic min-max games to demonstrate linear convergence to the Nashequilibrium.

Elastic full waveforminversion (FWI) is widely applied for characterizing reservoir properties. Inthis paper, we introduce $\mathbf{\mathbb{E}^{FWI}}$, a comprehensive benchmarkdataset that is specifically designed for elastic FWI.$\mathbf{\mathbb{E}^{FWI}}$ encompasses 8 distinct datasets that cover diversesubsurface geologic structures (flat, curve, faults, etc). The benchmarkresults produced by three different deep learning methods are provided. Incontrast to our previously presented dataset (pressure recordings) for acousticFWI (referred to as OpenFWI), the seismic dataset in$\mathbf{\mathbb{E}^{FWI}}$ has both vertical and horizontal components.Moreover, the velocity maps in $\mathbf{\mathbb{E}^{FWI}}$ incorporate both P-and S-wave velocities. While the multicomponent data and the added S-wavevelocity make the data more realistic, more challenges are introduced regardingthe convergence and computational cost of the inversion. We conductcomprehensive numerical experiments to explore the relationship between P-waveand S-wave velocities in seismic data. The relation between P- and S-wavevelocities provides crucial insights into the subsurface properties such aslithology, porosity, fluid content, etc. We anticipate that$\mathbf{\mathbb{E}^{FWI}}$ will facilitate future research on multiparameterinversions and stimulate endeavors in several critical research topics ofcarbon-zero and new energy exploration.

However, arecurrence-free variant of Transformer can obtain mixed comparisons with LSTM,producing the same Kling-Gupta efficiency coefficient (KGE), along with othermetrics. The lack of advantages for the Transformer is linked to the Markoviannature of the hydrologic prediction problem. Similar to LSTM, the Transformercan also merge multiple forcing dataset to improve model performance. While theTransformer results are not higher than current state-of-the-art, we stilllearned some valuable lessons: (1) the vanilla Transformer architecture is notsuitable for hydrologic modeling; (2) the proposed recurrence-free modificationcan improve Transformer performance so future work can continue to test more ofsuch modifications; and (3) the prediction limits on the dataset should beclose to the current state-of-the-art model. As a non-recurrent model, theTransformer may bear scale advantages for learning from bigger datasets andstoring knowledge. This work serves as a reference point for futuremodifications of the model.</description><author>Jiangtao Liu, Yuchen Bian, Chaopeng Shen</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 18:06:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12384v1</guid></item><item><title>Sample Complexity for Quadratic Bandits: Hessian Dependent Bounds and Optimal Algorithms</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12383v1</link><description>In stochastic zeroth-order optimization, a problem of practical relevance isunderstanding how to fully exploit the local geometry of the underlyingobjective function. We consider a fundamental setting in which the objectivefunction is quadratic, and provide the first tight characterization of theoptimal Hessian-dependent sample complexity. Our contribution is twofold.First, from an information-theoretic point of view, we prove tight lower boundson Hessian-dependent complexities by introducing a concept called energyallocation, which captures the interaction between the searching algorithm andthe geometry of objective functions. A matching upper bound is obtained bysolving the optimal energy spectrum. Then, algorithmically, we show theexistence of a Hessian-independent algorithm that universally achieves theasymptotic optimal sample complexities for all Hessian instances. The optimalsample complexities achieved by our algorithm remain valid for heavy-tailednoise distributions, which are enabled by a truncation method.</description><author>Qian Yu, Yining Wang, Baihe Huang, Qi Lei, Jason D.

Existing methodsupdate the source model by (re-)training on each target domain. Whileeffective, re-training is sensitive to the amount and order of the data and thehyperparameters for optimization. We instead update the target data, byprojecting all test inputs toward the source domain with a generative diffusionmodel. Our diffusion-driven adaptation method, DDA, shares its models forclassification and generation across all domains. Both models are trained onthe source domain, then fixed during testing. We augment diffusion with imageguidance and self-ensembling to automatically decide how much to adapt. Inputadaptation by DDA is more robust than prior model adaptation approaches acrossa variety of corruptions, architectures, and data regimes on the ImageNet-Cbenchmark. With its input-wise updates, DDA succeeds where model adaptationdegrades on too little data in small batches, dependent data in non-uniformorder, or mixed data with multiple corruptions.</description><author>Jin Gao, Jialing Zhang, Xihui Liu, Trevor Darrell, Evan Shelhamer, Dequan Wang</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 17:57:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03442v2</guid></item><item><title>On the Validation of Gibbs Algorithms: Training Datasets, Test Datasets and their Aggregation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12380v1</link><description>The dependence on training data of the Gibbs algorithm (GA) is analyticallycharacterized.

Various types of neuromorphic computation can be realizedusing spintronic oscillators, where the DC current induces magnetizationprecession, which turns into an AC voltage generator. However, in spintronics,synchronization of two oscillators using a DC signal is still a challengingproblem because it requires a certain degree of similarity between devices thatare to be synchronized, which may be difficult to achieve due to deviceparameter distribution during the fabrication process. In this work, we presentexperimental results on the mechanisms of synchronization of spin-torqueoscillators. Devices are based on magnetic tunnel junction with aperpendicularly magnetized free layer and take advantage of a uniformmagnetization precision in the presence of the magnetic field and a DC bias.

Activelearning attempts to minimize the need for large annotated samples by activelysampling the most informative examples for annotation. These examplescontribute significantly to improving the performance of supervised machinelearning models, and thus, active learning can play an essential role inselecting the most appropriate information in deep learning-based diagnosis,clinical assessments, and treatment planning. Although some existing works haveproposed methods for sampling the best examples for annotation in medical imageanalysis, they are not task-agnostic and do not use multimodal auxiliaryinformation in the sampler, which has the potential to increase robustness.Therefore, in this work, we propose a Multimodal Variational Adversarial ActiveLearning (M-VAAL) method that uses auxiliary information from additionalmodalities to enhance the active sampling. We applied our method to twodatasets: i) brain tumor segmentation and multi-label classification using theBraTS2018 dataset, and ii) chest X-ray image classification using theCOVID-QU-Ex dataset. Our results show a promising direction towarddata-efficient learning under limited annotations.</description><author>Bidur Khanal, Binod Bhattarai, Bishesh Khanal, Danail Stoyanov, Cristian A.

To tackle real-world domains, these systems often use neuralnetworks to learn policies directly from pixels or other high-dimensionalsensory input. By contrast, much theory of RL has focused on discrete statespaces or worst-case analysis, and fundamental questions remain about thedynamics of policy learning in high-dimensional settings. Here, we propose asolvable high-dimensional model of RL that can capture a variety of learningprotocols, and derive its typical dynamics as a set of closed-form ordinarydifferential equations (ODEs). We derive optimal schedules for the learningrates and task difficulty - analogous to annealing schemes and curricula duringtraining in RL - and show that the model exhibits rich behaviour, includingdelayed learning under sparse rewards; a variety of learning regimes dependingon reward baselines; and a speed-accuracy trade-off driven by rewardstringency. Experiments on variants of the Procgen game "Bossfight" and ArcadeLearning Environment game "Pong" also show such a speed-accuracy trade-off inpractice. Together, these results take a step towards closing the gap betweentheory and practice in high-dimensional RL.</description><author>Nishil Patel, Sebastian Lee, Stefano Sarao Mannelli, Sebastian Goldt, Adrew Saxe</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 17:38:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10404v2</guid></item><item><title>WHAT, WHEN, and HOW to Ground: Designing User Persona-Aware Conversational Agents for Engaging Dialogue</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03361v2</link><description>This paper presents a method for building a personalized open-domain dialoguesystem to address the $\textit{WWH}$ ($\textit{WHAT}$, $\textit{WHEN}$, and$\textit{HOW}$) problem for natural response generation in a commercialsetting, where personalized dialogue responses are heavily interleaved withcasual response turns.

How should we explore an unknown dynamical systemsuch that the estimated model allows us to solve multiple downstream tasks in azero-shot manner? In this paper, we address this challenge, by developing analgorithm -- OPAX -- for active exploration. OPAX uses well-calibratedprobabilistic models to quantify the epistemic uncertainty about the unknowndynamics. It optimistically -- w.r.t. to plausible dynamics -- maximizes theinformation gain between the unknown dynamics and state observations. We showhow the resulting optimization problem can be reduced to an optimal controlproblem that can be solved at each episode using standard approaches. Weanalyze our algorithm for general models, and, in the case of Gaussian processdynamics, we give a sample complexity bound and show that the epistemicuncertainty converges to zero. In our experiments, we compare OPAX with otherheuristic active exploration approaches on several environments.

Multiple deep learning-based structures havebeen proposed for MRI reconstruction using CS, both in the k-space and imagedomains as well as using unrolled optimization methods. However, the drawbackof these structures is that they are not fully utilizing the information fromboth domains (k-space and image). Herein, we propose a deep learning-basedattention hybrid variational network that performs learning in both the k-spaceand image domain. We evaluate our method on a well-known open-source MRIdataset and a clinical MRI dataset of patients diagnosed with strokes from ourinstitution to demonstrate the performance of our network. In addition toquantitative evaluation, we undertook a blinded comparison of image qualityacross networks performed by a subspecialty trained radiologist.

To overcome this restrictionand circumvent the need to linearize the system, we propose a derivative-freeUnknown Input Sigma-point Kalman Filter (SPKF-nUI) where the SPKF isinterconnected with a general nonlinear UI estimator that can be implementedvia nonlinear optimization and data-driven approaches. The nonlinear UIestimator uses the posterior state estimate which is less susceptible to stateprediction error. In addition, we introduce a joint sigma-point transformationscheme to incorporate both the state and UI uncertainties in the estimation ofSPKF-nUI. An in-depth stochastic stability analysis proves that the proposedSPKF-nUI yields exponentially converging estimation error bounds underreasonable assumptions. Finally, two case studies are carried out on asimulation-based rigid robot and a physical soft robot, i.e., robots made ofsoft materials with complex dynamics to validate effectiveness of the proposedfilter on nonlinear dynamic systems.

Today, visualization methods form the foundationof our knowledge about the internal workings of neural networks, as a type ofmechanistic interpretability. Here we ask: How reliable are featurevisualizations? We start our investigation by developing network circuits thattrick feature visualizations into showing arbitrary patterns that arecompletely disconnected from normal network behavior on natural input. We thenprovide evidence for a similar phenomenon occurring in standard, unmanipulatednetworks: feature visualizations are processed very differently from standardinput, casting doubt on their ability to "explain" how neural networks processnatural images. We underpin this empirical finding by theory proving that theset of functions that can be reliably understood by feature visualization isextremely small and does not include general black-box neural networks.Therefore, a promising way forward could be the development of networks thatenforce certain structures in order to ensure more reliable featurevisualizations.</description><author>Robert Geirhos, Roland S.

We address this lack of fastsimulators using neural PDE surrogates, data-driven neural network-basedsurrogate models trained using solutions generated with a classical numericalmethod. The surrogate approximates a time-stepping operator that evolves thefull spatial solution of a reference physics-based model over time. We useDIV1D, a 1D dynamic model of the divertor plasma, as reference model togenerate data. DIV1D's domain covers a 1D heat flux tube from the X-point(upstream) to the target. We simulate a realistic TCV divertor plasma withdynamics induced by upstream density ramps and provide an exploratory outlooktowards fast transients. State-of-the-art neural PDE surrogates are evaluatedin a common framework and extended for properties of the DIV1D data. Weevaluate (1) the speed-accuracy trade-off; (2) recreating non-linear behavior;(3) data efficiency; and (4) parameter inter- and extrapolation.

However, many real-world graphs are heterophilous, challenging thehomophily assumption of classical GNNs. To solve the universality problem, manystudies deepen networks or concatenate intermediate representations, which doesnot inherently change neighbor aggregation and introduces noise. Recent studiespropose new metrics to characterize the homophily, but rarely consider thecorrelation of the proposed metrics and models. In this paper, we first designa new metric, Neighborhood Homophily (\textit{NH}), to measure the labelcomplexity or purity in node neighborhoods. Furthermore, we incorporate themetric into the classical graph convolutional network (GCN) architecture andpropose \textbf{N}eighborhood \textbf{H}omophily-based \textbf{G}raph\textbf{C}onvolutional \textbf{N}etwork (\textbf{NHGCN}). In this framework,neighbors are grouped by estimated \textit{NH} values and aggregated fromdifferent channels, and the resulting node predictions are then used in turn toestimate and update \textit{NH} values. The two processes of metric estimationand model inference are alternately optimized to achieve better nodeclassification. NHGCN achieves top overall performance on both homophilous andheterophilous benchmarks, with an improvement of up to 7.4\% compared to thecurrent SOTA methods.</description><author>Shengbo Gong, Jiajun Zhou, Chenxuan Xie, Qi Xuan</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 16:44:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09851v2</guid></item><item><title>Exploring Vision-Language Models for Imbalanced Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01457v2</link><description>Vision-Language models (VLMs) that use contrastive language-imagepre-training have shown promising zero-shot classification performance.However, their performance on imbalanced dataset is relatively poor, where thedistribution of classes in the training dataset is skewed, leading to poorperformance in predicting minority classes.

The recent work Local Implicit Image Function (LIIF)has achieved satisfactory performance for continuous image representation,where pixel values are inferred from a neural network in a continuous spatialdomain. However, the computational cost of such implicit arbitrary-scalesuper-resolution (SR) methods increases rapidly as the scale factor increases,which makes arbitrary-scale SR time-consuming. In this paper, we proposeDynamic Implicit Image Function (DIIF), which is a fast and efficient method torepresent images with arbitrary resolution. Instead of taking an imagecoordinate and the nearest 2D deep features as inputs to predict its pixelvalue, we propose a coordinate grouping and slicing strategy, which enables theneural network to perform decoding from coordinate slices to pixel valueslices. We further propose a Coarse-to-Fine Multilayer Perceptron (C2F-MLP) toperform decoding with dynamic coordinate slicing, where the number ofcoordinates in each slice varies as the scale factor varies. With dynamiccoordinate slicing, DIIF significantly reduces the computational cost whenencountering arbitrary-scale SR. Experimental results demonstrate that DIIF canbe integrated with implicit arbitrary-scale SR methods and achieves SOTA SRperformance with significantly superior computational efficiency, therebyopening a path for real-time arbitrary-scale image representation.

This is commonly achieved by copyingpretrained weights from the source policy to the target policy prior totraining, under the constraint that they use the same model architecture.However, not only does this require a robust representation learned over a widedistribution of states -- often failing to transfer between specialist modelstrained over single tasks -- but it is largely uninterpretable and provideslittle indication of what knowledge is transferred. In this work, we propose analternative approach to transfer learning between tasks based on actionadvising, in which a teacher trained in a source task actively guides astudent's exploration in a target task.

We propose "StructuredCooperative Learning (SCooL)", in which a cooperation graph across devices isgenerated by a graphical model prior to automatically coordinate mutuallearning between devices. By choosing graphical models enforcing differentstructures, we can derive a rich class of existing and novel decentralizedlearning algorithms via variational inference. In particular, we show threeinstantiations of SCooL that adopt Dirac distribution, stochastic block model(SBM), and attention as the prior generating cooperation graphs. These EM-typealgorithms alternate between updating the cooperation graph and cooperativelearning of local models. They can automatically capture the cross-taskcorrelations among devices by only monitoring their model updating in order tooptimize the cooperation graph. We evaluate SCooL and compare it with existingdecentralized learning methods on an extensive set of benchmarks, on whichSCooL always achieves the highest accuracy of personalized models andsignificantly outperforms other baselines on communication efficiency.

Nevertheless, thereexists no large-scale survey that evaluates recent SOTA methods on diverse,realistic, and challenging benchmark tasks in a systematic manner. To provide aclear picture of the current state of BDL research, we evaluate modern BDLalgorithms on real-world datasets from the WILDS collection containingchallenging classification and regression tasks, with a focus on generalizationcapability and calibration under distribution shift. We compare the algorithmson a wide range of large, convolutional and transformer-based neural networkarchitectures. In particular, we investigate a signed version of the expectedcalibration error that reveals whether the methods are over- orunder-confident, providing further insight into the behavior of the methods.Further, we provide the first systematic evaluation of BDL for fine-tuninglarge pre-trained models, where training from scratch is prohibitivelyexpensive. Finally, given the recent success of Deep Ensembles, we extendpopular single-mode posterior approximations to multiple modes by the use ofensembles. While we find that ensembling single-mode approximations generallyimproves the generalization capability and calibration of the models by asignificant margin, we also identify a failure mode of ensembles whenfinetuning large transformer-based language models.

However, among the many configurations introduced in theliterature, the arrays that provide the largest hole-free co-array are the mostsusceptible to sensor failures. We propose here two machine learning (ML)methods to mitigate the effect of sensor failures and maintain the DOAestimation performance and resolution.

However, exploiting suchadvice poses challenges due to its potential inaccuracy. To address this issue,we propose a framework that enhances online resource allocation decisions withpotentially unreliable machine-learned (ML) advice. We assume here that thisadvice is represented by a general convex uncertainty set for the demandvector. We introduce a parameterized class of Pareto optimal online resourceallocation algorithms that strike a balance between consistent and robustratios. The consistent ratio measures the algorithm's performance (compared tothe optimal hindsight solution) when the ML advice is accurate, while therobust ratio captures performance under an adversarial demand process when theadvice is inaccurate. Specifically, in a C-Pareto optimal setting, we maximizethe robust ratio while ensuring that the consistent ratio is at least C. Ourproposed C-Pareto optimal algorithm is an adaptive protection level algorithm,which extends the classical fixed protection level algorithm introduced inLittlewood (2005) and Ball and Queyranne (2009). Solving a complex non-convexcontinuous optimization problem characterizes the adaptive protection levelalgorithm. To complement our algorithms, we present a simple method forcomputing the maximum achievable consistent ratio, which serves as an estimatefor the maximum value of the ML advice. Additionally, we present numericalstudies to evaluate the performance of our algorithm in comparison to benchmarkalgorithms. The results demonstrate that by adjusting the parameter C, ouralgorithms effectively strike a balance between worst-case and averageperformance, outperforming the benchmark algorithms.</description><author>Negin Golrezaei, Patrick Jaillet, Zijie Zhou</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 15:09:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12282v1</guid></item><item><title>SIFTER: A Task-specific Alignment Strategy for Enhancing Sentence Embeddings</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12280v1</link><description>The paradigm of pre-training followed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks hasbecome the mainstream method in natural language processing tasks. Althoughpre-trained models have the advantage of generalization, their performance maystill vary significantly across different domain tasks. This is because thedata distribution in different domains varies. For example, the different partsof the sentence 'He married Smt. Dipali Ghosh in 1947 and led a very happymarried life' may have different impact for downstream tasks. For similaritycalculations, words such as 'led' and 'life' are more important. On the otherhand, for sentiment analysis, the word 'happy' is crucial. This indicates thatdifferent downstream tasks have different levels of sensitivity to sentencecomponents. Our starting point is to scale information of the model and dataaccording to the specifics of downstream tasks, enhancing domain information ofrelevant parts for these tasks and reducing irrelevant elements for differentdomain tasks, called SIFTER. In the experimental part, we use the SIFTER toimprove SimCSE by constructing positive sample pairs based on enhancing thesentence stem and reducing the unimportant components in the sentence, andmaximize the similarity between three sentences. Similarly, SIFTER can improvethe gate mechanism of the LSTM model by short-circuiting the input gate ofimportant words so that the LSTM model remembers the important parts of thesentence. Our experiments demonstrate that SIFTER outperforms the SimCSE andLSTM baselines.</description><author>Chao Yu, Wenhao Zhu, Chaoming Liu, Xiaoyu Zhang, Qiuhong zhai</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 15:08:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12280v1</guid></item><item><title>Input Augmentation with SAM: Boosting Medical Image Segmentation with Segmentation Foundation Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11332v2</link><description>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a recently developed large model forgeneral-purpose segmentation for computer vision tasks. SAM was trained using11 million images with over 1 billion masks and can produce segmentationresults for a wide range of objects in natural scene images. SAM can be viewedas a general perception model for segmentation (partitioning images intosemantically meaningful regions). Thus, how to utilize such a large foundationmodel for medical image segmentation is an emerging research target. This papershows that although SAM does not immediately give high-quality segmentation formedical image data, its generated masks, features, and stability scores areuseful for building and training better medical image segmentation models. Inparticular, we demonstrate how to use SAM to augment image input forcommonly-used medical image segmentation models (e.g., U-Net).

This paperprovides a software utility to help realize this potential, extending theapplicability of GPTs to continuous-time sequences of complex events withinternal dependencies, such as medical record datasets. Despite theirpotential, the adoption of foundation models in these domains has been hamperedby the lack of suitable tools for model construction and evaluation. To bridgethis gap, we introduce Event Stream GPT (ESGPT), an open-source librarydesigned to streamline the end-to-end process for building GPTs forcontinuous-time event sequences. ESGPT allows users to (1) build flexible,foundation-model scale input datasets by specifying only a minimalconfiguration file, (2) leverage a Hugging Face compatible modeling API forGPTs over this modality that incorporates intra-event causal dependencystructures and autoregressive generation capabilities, and (3) evaluate modelsvia standardized processes that can assess few and even zero-shot performanceof pre-trained models on user-specified fine-tuning tasks.</description><author>Matthew B.

These models are typically trained in specialized clusters featuringfast, homogeneous interconnects and using carefully designed software systemsthat support both data parallelism and model/pipeline parallelism. Suchdedicated clusters can be costly and difficult to obtain. Can we insteadleverage the much greater amount of decentralized, heterogeneous, andlower-bandwidth interconnected compute? Previous works examining theheterogeneous, decentralized setting focus on relatively small models that canbe trained in a purely data parallel manner.

Once the committor is computed, the transition channels and thetransition rate can be readily found.

The exoplanet signals can only beidentified when combining several observations with dedicated detectionalgorithms. In contrast to most of existing methods, we propose to learn amodel of the spatial, temporal and spectral characteristics of the nuisance,directly from the observations. In a pre-processing step, a statistical modelof their correlations is built locally, and the data are centered and whitenedto improve both their stationarity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Wikidata statements are annotated with qualifier-valuepairs that are used to depict information, such as the validity context of thestatement, its causality, provenances, etc. Handling the qualifiers inreasoning is a challenging problem. When defining inference rules (inparticular, rules on ontological properties (x subclass of y, z instance of x,etc.)), one must consider the qualifiers, as most of them participate in thesemantics of the statements. This poses a complex problem because a) there is amassive number of qualifiers, and b) the qualifiers of the inferred statementare often a combination of the qualifiers in the rule condition. In this work,we propose to address this problem by a) defining a categorization of thequalifiers b) formalizing the Wikidata model with a many-sorted logicallanguage; the sorts of this language are the qualifier categories. We couplethis logic with an algebraic specification that provides a means foreffectively handling qualifiers in inference rules. Using Wikidata ontologicalproperties, we show how to use the MSL and specification to reason onqualifiers. Finally, we discuss the methodology for practically implementingthe work and present a prototype implementation. The work can be naturallyextended, thanks to the extensibility of the many-sorted algebraicspecification, to cover more qualifiers in the specification, such as uncertaintime, recurring events, geographic locations, and others.</description><author>Sahar Aljalbout, Gilles Falquet, Didier Buchs</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 14:12:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03375v2</guid></item><item><title>Knowledge-based Multimodal Music Similarity</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12249v1</link><description>Music similarity is an essential aspect of music retrieval, recommendationsystems, and music analysis.

Our approach is inspired by the factthat human actions are usually driven by their intentions or desires, and areinfluenced by environmental factors such as the spatial relationships withsurrounding objects. In this paper, we introduce a set of spatial-temporallogic rules as knowledge to explain human actions. These rules will beautomatically discovered from observational data. To learn the model parametersand the rule content, we design an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm,which treats the rule content as latent variables. The EM algorithm alternatesbetween the E-step and M-step: in the E-step, the posterior distribution overthe latent rule content is evaluated; in the M-step, the rule generator andmodel parameters are jointly optimized by maximizing the current expectedlog-likelihood. Our model may have a wide range of applications in areas suchas sports analytics, robotics, and autonomous cars, where understanding humanmovements are essential.

Consequently, clinical decision making iscentered on accurate knowledge of timing and often requires a radiologist tointerpret Computed Tomography (CT) of the brain to confirm the occurrence andage of an event. These tasks are particularly challenging due to the subtleexpression of acute ischemic lesions and the dynamic nature of theirappearance. Automation efforts have not yet applied deep learning to estimatelesion age and treated these two tasks independently, so, have overlooked theirinherent complementary relationship. To leverage this, we propose a novelend-to-end multi-task transformer-based network optimized for concurrentsegmentation and age estimation of cerebral ischemic lesions. By utilizinggated positional self-attention and CT-specific data augmentation, the proposedmethod can capture long-range spatial dependencies while maintaining itsability to be trained from scratch under low-data regimes commonly found inmedical imaging. Furthermore, to better combine multiple predictions, weincorporate uncertainty by utilizing quantile loss to facilitate estimating aprobability density function of lesion age. The effectiveness of our model isthen extensively evaluated on a clinical dataset consisting of 776 CT imagesfrom two medical centers.

It has been shown that under specific conditions, DSTis able to outperform dense models. The key components of this framework arethe pruning and growing criteria, which are repeatedly applied during thetraining process to adjust the network's sparse connectivity. While the growingcriterion's impact on DST performance is relatively well studied, the influenceof the pruning criterion remains overlooked. To address this issue, we designand perform an extensive empirical analysis of various pruning criteria tobetter understand their effect on the dynamics of DST solutions. Surprisingly,we find that most of the studied methods yield similar results. The differencesbecome more significant in the low-density regime, where the best performanceis predominantly given by the simplest technique: magnitude-based pruning.

ExistingCNN models act as black boxes, not ensuring to the physicians that importantdiagnostic features are used by the model. Building on top of successfullyexisting techniques such as multi-task learning, domain adversarial trainingand concept-based interpretability, this paper addresses the challenge ofintroducing diagnostic factors in the training objectives. Here we show thatour architecture, by learning end-to-end an uncertainty-based weightingcombination of multi-task and adversarial losses, is encouraged to focus onpathology features such as density and pleomorphism of nuclei, e.g. variationsin size and appearance, while discarding misleading features such as stainingdifferences.

Recently,data-driven approaches to RUL predictions are becoming prevalent overmodel-based approaches since no underlying physical knowledge of theengineering system is required. Yet, this just replaces required expertise ofthe underlying physics with machine learning (ML) expertise, which is oftenalso not available. Automated machine learning (AutoML) promises to buildend-to-end ML pipelines automatically enabling domain experts without MLexpertise to create their own models. This paper introduces AutoRUL, anAutoML-driven end-to-end approach for automatic RUL predictions. AutoRULcombines fine-tuned standard regression methods to an ensemble with highpredictive power. By evaluating the proposed method on eight real-world andsynthetic datasets against state-of-the-art hand-crafted models, we show thatAutoML provides a viable alternative to hand-crafted data-driven RULpredictions. Consequently, creating RUL predictions can be made more accessiblefor domain experts using AutoML by eliminating ML expertise from data-drivenmodel construction.</description><author>Marc-André Zöller, Fabian Mauthe, Peter Zeiler, Marius Lindauer, Marco F.

The list of LLM successes is long and varied. Nevertheless,several recent papers provide empirical evidence that LLMs fail to captureimportant aspects of linguistic meaning. Focusing on universal quantification,we provide a theoretical foundation for these empirical findings by provingthat LLMs cannot learn certain fundamental semantic properties includingsemantic entailment and consistency as they are defined in formal semantics.More generally, we show that LLMs are unable to learn concepts beyond the firstlevel of the Borel Hierarchy, which imposes severe limits on the ability ofLMs, both large and small, to capture many aspects of linguistic meaning. Thismeans that LLMs will continue to operate without formal guarantees on tasksthat require entailments and deep linguistic understanding.</description><author>Nicholas Asher, Swarnadeep Bhar, Akshay Chaturvedi, Julie Hunter, Soumya Paul</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 13:11:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12213v1</guid></item><item><title>MimiC: Combating Client Dropouts in Federated Learning by Mimicking Central Updates</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12212v1</link><description>Federated learning (FL) is a promising framework for privacy-preservingcollaborative learning. In FL, the model training tasks are distributed toclients and only the model updates need to be collected at a central server.However, when being deployed at the mobile edge network, clients (e.g.,smartphones and wearables) may have unpredictable availability and randomlydrop out of any training iteration, which hinders FL from achieving theconvergence. This paper tackles such a critical challenge of FL. In particular,we first investigate the convergence of the classical FedAvg algorithm witharbitrary client dropouts. We find that with the common choice of a decayinglearning rate, FedAvg can only oscillate within the neighborhood of astationary point of the global loss function, which is caused by the divergencebetween the aggregated update and the desired central update. Motivated by thisnew observation, we then design a novel training algorithm named MimiC, wherethe server modifies each received model update based on the previous ones. Theproposed modification of the received model updates is able to mimic theimaginary central update irrespective of the dropout clients. The theoreticalanalysis of MimiC shows that the divergence between the aggregated update andthe central update diminishes with a proper choice of the learning rates,leading to its convergence. Simulation results further demonstrate that MimiCmaintains stable convergence performance in the presence of client dropouts andlearns better models than the baseline methods.</description><author>Yuchang Sun, Yuyi Mao, Jun Zhang</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 13:11:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12212v1</guid></item><item><title>Equivariant Differentially Private Deep Learning: Why DP-SGD Needs Sparser Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13104v2</link><description>Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) limits the amountof private information deep learning models can memorize during training. Thisis achieved by clipping and adding noise to the model's gradients, and thusnetworks with more parameters require proportionally stronger perturbation. Asa result, large models have difficulties learning useful information, renderingtraining with DP-SGD exceedingly difficult on more challenging training tasks.Recent research has focused on combating this challenge through trainingadaptations such as heavy data augmentation and large batch sizes. However,these techniques further increase the computational overhead of DP-SGD andreduce its practical applicability. In this work, we propose using theprinciple of sparse model design to solve precisely such complex tasks withfewer parameters, higher accuracy, and in less time, thus serving as apromising direction for DP-SGD. We achieve such sparsity by design byintroducing equivariant convolutional networks for model training withDifferential Privacy. Using equivariant networks, we show that small andefficient architecture design can outperform current state-of-the-art modelswith substantially lower computational requirements. On CIFAR-10, we achieve anincrease of up to $9\%$ in accuracy while reducing the computation time by morethan $85\%$.

Ideally, when models are pre-trainedon large amount of data, they are expected to gain implicit knowledge. In thispaper, we investigate the ability of pre-trained language models to generalizeto different non-language tasks. In particular, we test them on tasks fromdifferent domains such as computer vision, reasoning on hierarchical data, andprotein fold prediction. The four pre-trained models that we used, T5, BART,BERT, and GPT-2 achieve outstanding results. They all have similar performanceand they outperform transformers that are trained from scratch by a largemargin. For instance, pre-trained language models perform better on the Listopsdataset, with an average accuracy of 58.7\%, compared to transformers trainedfrom scratch, which have an average accuracy of 29.0\%. The significantimprovement demonstrated across three types of datasets suggests thatpre-training on language helps the models to acquire general knowledge,bringing us a step closer to general AI. We also showed that reducing thenumber of parameters in pre-trained language models does not have a greatimpact as the performance drops slightly when using T5-Small instead ofT5-Base. In fact, when using only 2\% of the parameters, we achieved a greatimprovement compared to training from scratch. Finally, in contrast to priorwork, we find out that using pre-trained embeddings for the input layer isnecessary to achieve the desired results.</description><author>Mohamad Ballout, Ulf Krumnack, Gunther Heidemann, Kai-Uwe Kühnberger</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 12:55:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12205v1</guid></item><item><title>Polygon Detection for Room Layout Estimation using Heterogeneous Graphs and Wireframes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12203v1</link><description>This paper presents a neural network based semantic plane detection methodutilizing polygon representations.

Two differentmethods for this last step are investigated, where the most promising method isbuilt on a heterogeneous graph transformer. The final output is in all cases aprojection of the semantic planes in 2D. The methods are evaluated on theStructured 3D dataset and we investigate the performance both using sampled andestimated wireframes. The experiments show the potential of the graph-basedmethod by outperforming state of the art methods in Room Layout estimation inthe 2D metrics using synthetic wireframe detections.</description><author>David Gillsjö, Gabrielle Flood, Kalle Åström</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 12:55:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12203v1</guid></item><item><title>Opening the Black Box: Analyzing Attention Weights and Hidden States in Pre-trained Language Models for Non-language Tasks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12198v1</link><description>Investigating deep learning language models has always been a significantresearch area due to the ``black box" nature of most advanced models. With therecent advancements in pre-trained language models based on transformers andtheir increasing integration into daily life, addressing this issue has becomemore pressing. In order to achieve an explainable AI model, it is essential tocomprehend the procedural steps involved and compare them with human thoughtprocesses. Thus, in this paper, we use simple, well-understood non-languagetasks to explore these models' inner workings. Specifically, we apply apre-trained language model to constrained arithmetic problems with hierarchicalstructure, to analyze their attention weight scores and hidden states. Theinvestigation reveals promising results, with the model addressing hierarchicalproblems in a moderately structured manner, similar to human problem-solvingstrategies. Additionally, by inspecting the attention weights layer by layer,we uncover an unconventional finding that layer 10, rather than the model'sfinal layer, is the optimal layer to unfreeze for the least parameter-intensiveapproach to fine-tune the model. We support these findings with entropyanalysis and token embeddings similarity analysis. The attention analysisallows us to hypothesize that the model can generalize to longer sequences inListOps dataset, a conclusion later confirmed through testing on sequenceslonger than those in the training set. Lastly, by utilizing a straightforwardtask in which the model predicts the winner of a Tic Tac Toe game, we identifylimitations in attention analysis, particularly its inability to capture 2Dpatterns.</description><author>Mohamad Ballout, Ulf Krumnack, Gunther Heidemann, Kai-Uwe Kühnberger</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 12:48:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12198v1</guid></item><item><title>Split Learning in 6G Edge Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12194v1</link><description>With the proliferation of distributed edge computing resources, the 6G mobilenetwork will evolve into a network for connected intelligence. Along this line,the proposal to incorporate federated learning into the mobile edge has gainedconsiderable interest in recent years. However, the deployment of federatedlearning faces substantial challenges as massive resource-limited IoT devicescan hardly support on-device model training. This leads to the emergence ofsplit learning (SL) which enables servers to handle the major training workloadwhile still enhancing data privacy. In this article, we offer a brief overviewof key advancements in SL and articulate its seamless integration with wirelessedge networks. We begin by illustrating the tailored 6G architecture to supportedge SL. Then, we examine the critical design issues for edge SL, includinginnovative resource-efficient learning frameworks and resource managementstrategies under a single edge server. Additionally, we expand the scope tomulti-edge scenarios, exploring multi-edge collaboration and mobilitymanagement from a networking perspective. Finally, we discuss open problems foredge SL, including convergence analysis, asynchronous SL and U-shaped SL.</description><author>Zheng Lin, Guanqiao Qu, Xianhao Chen, Kaibin Huang</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 12:42:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12194v1</guid></item><item><title>Quantifying lottery tickets under label noise: accuracy, calibration, and complexity</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12190v1</link><description>Pruning deep neural networks is a widely used strategy to alleviate thecomputational burden in machine learning. Overwhelming empirical evidencesuggests that pruned models retain very high accuracy even with a tiny fractionof parameters. However, relatively little work has gone into characterising thesmall pruned networks obtained, beyond a measure of their accuracy. In thispaper, we use the sparse double descent approach to identify univocally andcharacterise pruned models associated with classification tasks. We observeempirically that, for a given task, iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) tends toconverge to networks of comparable sizes even when starting from full networkswith sizes ranging over orders of magnitude. We analyse the best pruned modelsin a controlled experimental setup and show that their number of parametersreflects task difficulty and that they are much better than full networks atcapturing the true conditional probability distribution of the labels. On realdata, we similarly observe that pruned models are less prone to overconfidentpredictions. Our results suggest that pruned models obtained via IMP not onlyhave advantageous computational properties but also provide a betterrepresentation of uncertainty in learning.</description><author>Viplove Arora, Daniele Irto, Sebastian Goldt, Guido Sanguinetti</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 12:35:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12190v1</guid></item><item><title>Annotating Ambiguous Images: General Annotation Strategy for Image Classification with Real-World Biomedical Validation on Vertebral Fracture Diagnosis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12189v1</link><description>While numerous methods exist to solve classification problems within curateddatasets, these solutions often fall short in biomedical applications due tothe biased or ambiguous nature of the data.

The standard method torepresent facial expressions for 3D characters is by blendshapes, a vector ofweights representing the avatar's neutral shape and its variations under facialexpressions, e.g., smile, puff, blinking. Datasets of paired frames withblendshape vectors are rare, and labeling can be laborious, time-consuming, andsubjective. In this work, we developed an approach that handles the lack ofappropriate datasets. Instead, we used a synthetic dataset of only onecharacter. To generalize various characters, we re-represented each frame toface landmarks. We developed a unique deep-learning architecture that groupslandmarks for each facial organ and connects them to relevant blendshapeweights. Additionally, we incorporated complementary methods for facialexpressions that landmarks did not represent well and gave special attention toeye expressions. We have demonstrated the superiority of our approach toprevious research in qualitative and quantitative metrics. Our approachachieved a higher MOS of 68% and a lower MSE of 44.2% when tested on videoswith various users and expressions.</description><author>Ariel Larey, Omri Asraf, Adam Kelder, Itzik Wilf, Ofer Kruzel, Nati Daniel</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 12:35:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12188v1</guid></item><item><title>Multimodal Sentiment Analysis: A Survey</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07611v2</link><description>Multimodal sentiment analysis has become an important research area in thefield of artificial intelligence.

Whilecurrent car detection systems are capable of good detection, reliable detectioncan still be challenging due to factors such as proximity between the car,light intensity, and environmental visibility. To address these issues, wepropose cross-domain Car Detection Model with integrated convolutional blockAttention mechanism(CDMA) that we apply to car recognition for autonomousdriving and other areas. CDMA includes several novelties: 1)Building a completecross-domain target detection framework. 2)Developing an unpaired target domainpicture generation module with an integrated convolutional attention mechanismwhich specifically emphasizes the car headlights feature. 3)AdoptingGeneralized Intersection over Union (GIOU) as the loss function of the targetdetection framework. 4)Designing an object detection model integrated withtwo-headed Convolutional Block Attention Module(CBAM). 5)Utilizing an effectivedata enhancement method.

DNN surgery, which partitions DNNprocessing between mobile devices and multi-access edge computing (MEC)servers, can enable real-time inference despite the computational limitationsof mobile devices. However, DNN surgery faces a critical challenge: determiningthe optimal computing resource demand from the server and the correspondingpartition strategy, while considering both inference latency and MEC serverusage costs. This problem is compounded by two factors: (1) the finitecomputing capacity of the MEC server, which is shared among multiple devices,leading to inter-dependent demands, and (2) the shift in modern DNNarchitecture from chains to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which complicatespotential solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel Decentralized DNN Surgery (DDS)framework. We formulate the partition strategy as a min-cut and propose aresource allocation game to adaptively schedule the demands of mobile devicesin an MEC environment. We prove the existence of a Nash Equilibrium (NE), anddevelop an iterative algorithm to efficiently reach the NE for each device. Ourextensive experiments demonstrate that DDS can effectively handle varying MECscenarios, achieving up to 1.25$\times$ acceleration compared to thestate-of-the-art algorithm.</description><author>Xiang Yang, Dezhi Chen, Qi Qi, Jingyu Wang, Haifeng Sun, Jianxin Liao, Song Guo</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 12:32:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12185v1</guid></item><item><title>BayLing: Bridging Cross-lingual Alignment and Instruction Following through Interactive Translation for Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10968v2</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable prowess in languageunderstanding and generation. Advancing from foundation LLMs toinstructionfollowing LLMs, instruction tuning plays a vital role in aligningLLMs to human preferences. However, the existing LLMs are usually focused onEnglish, leading to inferior performance in non-English languages. In order toimprove the performance for non-English languages, it is necessary to collectlanguage-specific training data for foundation LLMs and constructlanguage-specific instructions for instruction tuning, both of which are heavyloads. To minimize human workload, we propose to transfer the capabilities oflanguage generation and instruction following from English to other languagesthrough an interactive translation task. We have developed BayLing, aninstruction-following LLM by utilizing LLaMA as the foundation LLM andautomatically constructing interactive translation instructions for instructingtuning. Extensive assessments demonstrate that BayLing achieves comparableperformance to GPT-3.5-turbo, despite utilizing a considerably smallerparameter size of only 13 billion. Experimental results on translation tasksshow that BayLing achieves 95% of single-turn translation capability comparedto GPT-4 with automatic evaluation and 96% of interactive translationcapability compared to GPT-3.5-turbo with human evaluation. To estimate theperformance on general tasks, we created a multi-turn instruction test setcalled BayLing-80. The experimental results on BayLing-80 indicate that BayLingachieves 89% of performance compared to GPT-3.5-turbo. BayLing alsodemonstrates outstanding performance on knowledge assessment of Chinese GaoKaoand English SAT, second only to GPT-3.5-turbo among a multitude ofinstruction-following LLMs. Demo, homepage, code and models of BayLing areavailable.</description><author>Shaolei Zhang, Qingkai Fang, Zhuocheng Zhang, Zhengrui Ma, Yan Zhou, Langlin Huang, Mengyu Bu, Shangtong Gui, Yunji Chen, Xilin Chen, Yang Feng</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 12:31:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10968v2</guid></item><item><title>Adaptive Learning Path Navigation Based on Knowledge Tracing and Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04475v2</link><description>This paper introduces the Adaptive Learning Path Navigation (ALPN) system, anovel approach for enhancing E-learning platforms by providing highly adaptivelearning paths for students.

The perception module takes anRGBD image to perform semantic segmentation and bird's eye view (BEV) semanticmapping along with providing their encoded features. Meanwhile, the controllermodule processes these features with the measurement of GNSS locations andangular speed to estimate waypoints that come with latent features. Then, twodifferent agents are used to translate waypoints and latent features into a setof navigational controls to drive the vehicle. The model is evaluated bypredicting driving records and performing automated driving under variousconditions in real environments.

In interpretability research, getting to gripswith feature interactions is increasingly recognised as an important challenge,because interacting features are key to the success of neural networks. Featureinteractions allow a model to build up hierarchical representations for itsinput, and might provide an ideal starting point for the investigation intolinguistic structure in language models. However, uncovering the exact rolethat these interactions play is also difficult, and a diverse range ofinteraction attribution methods has been proposed. In this paper, we focus onthe question which of these methods most faithfully reflects the inner workingsof the target models. We work out a grey box methodology, in which we trainmodels to perfection on a formal language classification task, using PCFGs. Weshow that under specific configurations, some methods are indeed able touncover the grammatical rules acquired by a model. Based on these findings weextend our evaluation to a case study on language models, providing novelinsights into the linguistic structure that these models have acquired.</description><author>Jaap Jumelet, Willem Zuidema</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 12:24:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12181v1</guid></item><item><title>SGEM: Test-Time Adaptation for Automatic Speech Recognition via Sequential-Level Generalized Entropy Minimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01981v4</link><description>Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models are frequently exposed to datadistribution shifts in many real-world scenarios, leading to erroneouspredictions. To tackle this issue, an existing test-time adaptation (TTA)method has recently been proposed to adapt the pre-trained ASR model onunlabeled test instances without source data. Despite decent performance gain,this work relies solely on naive greedy decoding and performs adaptation acrosstimesteps at a frame level, which may not be optimal given the sequentialnature of the model output. Motivated by this, we propose a novel TTAframework, dubbed SGEM, for general ASR models. To treat the sequential output,SGEM first exploits beam search to explore candidate output logits and selectsthe most plausible one. Then, it utilizes generalized entropy minimization andnegative sampling as unsupervised objectives to adapt the model. SGEM achievesstate-of-the-art performance for three mainstream ASR models under variousdomain shifts.</description><author>Changhun Kim, Joonhyung Park, Hajin Shim, Eunho Yang</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 12:13:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01981v4</guid></item></channel></rss>
