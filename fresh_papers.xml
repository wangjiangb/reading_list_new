Existing cloth simulatorsproduce realistic cloth deformations that obey different types of boundaryconditions. Nevertheless, their operational principle remains limited inseveral ways: They operate on explicit surface representations with a fixedspatial resolution, perform a series of discretised updates (which bounds theirtemporal resolution), and require comparably large amounts of storage.Moreover, back-propagating gradients through the existing solvers is often notstraightforward, which poses additional challenges when integrating them intomodern neural architectures. In response to the limitations mentioned above,this paper takes a fundamentally different perspective on physically-plausiblecloth simulation and re-thinks this long-standing problem: We proposeNeuralClothSim, i.e., a new cloth simulation approach using thin shells, inwhich surface evolution is encoded in neural network weights. Ourmemory-efficient and differentiable solver operates on a new continuouscoordinate-based representation of dynamic surfaces, i.e., neural deformationfields (NDFs); it supervises NDF evolution with the rules of the non-linearKirchhoff-Love shell theory. NDFs are adaptive in the sense that they 1)allocate their capacity to the deformation details as the latter arise duringthe cloth evolution and 2) allow surface state queries at arbitrary spatial andtemporal resolutions without retraining. We show how to train ourNeuralClothSim solver while imposing hard boundary conditions and demonstratemultiple applications, such as material interpolation and simulation editing.The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our formulation and itspotential impact.</description><author>Navami Kairanda, Marc Habermann, Christian Theobalt, Vladislav Golyanik</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 18:59:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12970v1</guid></item><item><title>ROAM: Robust and Object-aware Motion Generation using Neural Pose Descriptors</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12969v1</link><description>Existing automatic approaches for 3D virtual character motion synthesissupporting scene interactions do not generalise well to new objects outsidetraining distributions, even when trained on extensive motion capture datasetswith diverse objects and annotated interactions. This paper addresses thislimitation and shows that robustness and generalisation to novel scene objectsin 3D object-aware character synthesis can be achieved by training a motionmodel with as few as one reference object. We leverage an implicit featurerepresentation trained on object-only datasets, which encodes anSE(3)-equivariant descriptor field around the object. Given an unseen objectand a reference pose-object pair, we optimise for the object-aware pose that isclosest in the feature space to the reference pose. Finally, we use l-NSM,i.e., our motion generation model that is trained to seamlessly transition fromlocomotion to object interaction with the proposed bidirectional pose blendingscheme. Through comprehensive numerical comparisons to state-of-the-art methodsand in a user study, we demonstrate substantial improvements in 3D virtualcharacter motion and interaction quality and robustness to scenarios withunseen objects.

However, existing methods require expensive per-sceneoptimization from many views hence limiting their application to real-worldunbounded urban settings where the objects of interest or backgrounds areobserved from very few views. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce a newapproach called NeO 360, Neural fields for sparse view synthesis of outdoorscenes. NeO 360 is a generalizable method that reconstructs 360{\deg} scenesfrom a single or a few posed RGB images. The essence of our approach is incapturing the distribution of complex real-world outdoor 3D scenes and using ahybrid image-conditional triplanar representation that can be queried from anyworld point. Our representation combines the best of both voxel-based andbird's-eye-view (BEV) representations and is more effective and expressive thaneach. NeO 360's representation allows us to learn from a large collection ofunbounded 3D scenes while offering generalizability to new views and novelscenes from as few as a single image during inference. We demonstrate ourapproach on the proposed challenging 360{\deg} unbounded dataset, called NeRDS360, and show that NeO 360 outperforms state-of-the-art generalizable methodsfor novel view synthesis while also offering editing and compositioncapabilities.

The challenges of this task lie inthe complexity of the scenes, the unique features of anime style, and the lackof high-quality datasets to bridge the domain gap. Despite promising attempts,previous efforts are still incompetent in achieving satisfactory results withconsistent semantic preservation, evident stylization, and fine details. Inthis study, we propose Scenimefy, a novel semi-supervised image-to-imagetranslation framework that addresses these challenges. Our approach guides thelearning with structure-consistent pseudo paired data, simplifying the pureunsupervised setting. The pseudo data are derived uniquely from asemantic-constrained StyleGAN leveraging rich model priors like CLIP. Wefurther apply segmentation-guided data selection to obtain high-quality pseudosupervision. A patch-wise contrastive style loss is introduced to improvestylization and fine details. Besides, we contribute a high-resolution animescene dataset to facilitate future research. Our extensive experimentsdemonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines interms of both perceptual quality and quantitative performance.</description><author>Yuxin Jiang, Liming Jiang, Shuai Yang, Chen Change Loy</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 18:59:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12968v1</guid></item><item><title>Qwen-VL: A Frontier Large Vision-Language Model with Versatile Abilities</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12966v1</link><description>We introduce the Qwen-VL series, a set of large-scale vision-language modelsdesigned to perceive and understand both text and images.

This makes the results useful for downstream tasks likehuman action recognition or 3D graphics. Yet, no regressor is perfect, andaccuracy can be affected by ambiguous image evidence or by poses and appearancethat are unseen during training. Most current HPS regressors, however, do notreport the confidence of their outputs, meaning that downstream tasks cannotdifferentiate accurate estimates from inaccurate ones. To address this, wedevelop POCO, a novel framework for training HPS regressors to estimate notonly a 3D human body, but also their confidence, in a single feed-forward pass.Specifically, POCO estimates both the 3D body pose and a per-sample variance.The key idea is to introduce a Dual Conditioning Strategy (DCS) for regressinguncertainty that is highly correlated to pose reconstruction quality. The POCOframework can be applied to any HPS regressor and here we evaluate it bymodifying HMR, PARE, and CLIFF. In all cases, training the network to reasonabout uncertainty helps it learn to more accurately estimate 3D pose. Whilethis was not our goal, the improvement is modest but consistent. Our mainmotivation is to provide uncertainty estimates for downstream tasks; wedemonstrate this in two ways: (1) We use the confidence estimates to bootstrapHPS training. Given unlabelled image data, we take the confident estimates of aPOCO-trained regressor as pseudo ground truth. Retraining with thisautomatically-curated data improves accuracy. (2) We exploit uncertainty invideo pose estimation by automatically identifying uncertain frames (e.g. dueto occlusion) and inpainting these from confident frames.

To address this, we proposeDenseDiffusion, a training-free method that adapts a pre-trained text-to-imagemodel to handle such dense captions while offering control over the scenelayout. We first analyze the relationship between generated images' layouts andthe pre-trained model's intermediate attention maps. Next, we develop anattention modulation method that guides objects to appear in specific regionsaccording to layout guidance. Without requiring additional fine-tuning ordatasets, we improve image generation performance given dense captionsregarding both automatic and human evaluation scores. In addition, we achievesimilar-quality visual results with models specifically trained with layoutconditions.</description><author>Yunji Kim, Jiyoung Lee, Jin-Hwa Kim, Jung-Woo Ha, Jun-Yan Zhu</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 18:59:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12964v1</guid></item><item><title>MapPrior: Bird's-Eye View Map Layout Estimation with Generative Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12963v1</link><description>Despite tremendous advancements in bird's-eye view (BEV) perception, existingmodels fall short in generating realistic and coherent semantic map layouts,and they fail to account for uncertainties arising from partial sensorinformation (such as occlusion or limited coverage).

Our MapPrior delivers predictions with better accuracy,realism, and uncertainty awareness. We evaluate our model on the large-scalenuScenes benchmark.

This suggests that the random masking strategy that isinherited from the image MAE is less effective for video MAE. This motivatesthe design of a novel masking algorithm that can more efficiently make use ofvideo saliency. Specifically, we propose a motion-guided masking algorithm(MGM) which leverages motion vectors to guide the position of each mask overtime. Crucially, these motion-based correspondences can be directly obtainedfrom information stored in the compressed format of the video, which makes ourmethod efficient and scalable. On two challenging large-scale video benchmarks(Kinetics-400 and Something-Something V2), we equip video MAE with our MGM andachieve up to +$1.3\%$ improvement compared to previous state-of-the-artmethods. Additionally, our MGM achieves equivalent performance to previousvideo MAE using up to $66\%$ fewer training epochs. Lastly, we show that MGMgeneralizes better to downstream transfer learning and domain adaptation taskson the UCF101, HMDB51, and Diving48 datasets, achieving up to +$4.9\%$improvement compared to baseline methods.</description><author>David Fan, Jue Wang, Shuai Liao, Yi Zhu, Vimal Bhat, Hector Santos-Villalobos, Rohith MV, Xinyu Li</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 18:58:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12962v1</guid></item><item><title>Less is More: Towards Efficient Few-shot 3D Semantic Segmentation via Training-free Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12961v1</link><description>To reduce the reliance on large-scale datasets, recent works in 3Dsegmentation resort to few-shot learning. Current 3D few-shot semanticsegmentation methods first pre-train the models on `seen' classes, and thenevaluate their generalization performance on `unseen' classes. However, theprior pre-training stage not only introduces excessive time overhead, but alsoincurs a significant domain gap on `unseen' classes. To tackle these issues, wepropose an efficient Training-free Few-shot 3D Segmentation netwrok, TFS3D, anda further training-based variant, TFS3D-T. Without any learnable parameters,TFS3D extracts dense representations by trigonometric positional encodings, andachieves comparable performance to previous training-based methods. Due to theelimination of pre-training, TFS3D can alleviate the domain gap issue and savea substantial amount of time. Building upon TFS3D, TFS3D-T only requires totrain a lightweight query-support transferring attention (QUEST), whichenhances the interaction between the few-shot query and support data.Experiments demonstrate TFS3D-T improves previous state-of-the-art methods by+6.93% and +17.96% mIoU respectively on S3DIS and ScanNet, while reducing thetraining time by -90%, indicating superior effectiveness and efficiency.</description><author>Xiangyang Zhu, Renrui Zhang, Bowei He, Ziyu Guo, Jiaming Liu, Hao Dong, Peng Gao</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 18:58:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12961v1</guid></item><item><title>Halo: Estimation and Reduction of Hallucinations in Open-Source Weak Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11764v2</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing(NLP).

Despite the success, most traditional VLMs-basedmethods are restricted by the assumption of partial source supervision or idealvocabularies, which rarely satisfy the open-world scenario. In this paper, weaim at a more challenging setting, Realistic Zero-Shot Classification, whichassumes no annotation but instead a broad vocabulary. To address thischallenge, we propose the Self Structural Semantic Alignment (S^3A) framework,which extracts the structural semantic information from unlabeled data whilesimultaneously self-learning. Our S^3A framework adopts a uniqueCluster-Vote-Prompt-Realign (CVPR) algorithm, which iteratively groupsunlabeled data to derive structural semantics for pseudo-supervision. Our CVPRprocess includes iterative clustering on images, voting within each cluster toidentify initial class candidates from the vocabulary, generatingdiscriminative prompts with large language models to discern confusingcandidates, and realigning images and the vocabulary as structural semanticalignment. Finally, we propose to self-learn the CLIP image encoder with bothindividual and structural semantic alignment through a teacher-student learningstrategy. Our comprehensive experiments across various generic and fine-grainedbenchmarks demonstrate that the S^3A method offers substantial improvementsover existing VLMs-based approaches, achieving a more than 15% accuracyimprovement over CLIP on average.

Knowledge distillation is well recognized as the essentialprocedure in model compression. However, existing knowledge distillationtechniques lack an in-depth investigation and analysis of VLP, and practicalguidelines for VLP-oriented distillation are still not yet explored. In thispaper, we present DLIP, a simple yet efficient Distilling Language-ImagePre-training framework, through which we investigate how to distill a light VLPmodel. Specifically, we dissect the model distillation from multipledimensions, such as the architecture characteristics of different modules andthe information transfer of different modalities. We conduct comprehensiveexperiments and provide insights on distilling a light but performant VLPmodel. Experimental results reveal that DLIP can achieve a state-of-the-artaccuracy/efficiency trade-off across diverse cross-modal tasks, e.g.,image-text retrieval, image captioning and visual question answering. Forexample, DLIP compresses BLIP by 1.9x, from 213M to 108M parameters, whileachieving comparable or better performance. Furthermore, DLIP succeeds inretaining more than 95% of the performance with 22.4% parameters and 24.8%FLOPs compared to the teacher model and accelerates inference speed by 2.7x.</description><author>Huafeng Kuang, Jie Wu, Xiawu Zheng, Ming Li, Xuefeng Xiao, Rui Wang, Min Zheng, Rongrong Ji</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 18:50:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12956v1</guid></item><item><title>Differentiable Microscopy Designs an All Optical Phase Retrieval Microscope</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14944v4</link><description>Since the late 16th century, scientists have continuously innovated anddeveloped new microscope types for various applications.

Despite its popularity in theseareas, the effectiveness of AA in classical machine learning classifiers hasnot been thoroughly studied. Tabular data, in particular, presents a uniquechallenge for deep learning models, and classical machine learning models areknown to perform better in these scenarios. However, the convergence analysisof these models has received limited attention. To address this gap inresearch, we implement a support vector machine (SVM) classifier variant thatincorporates AA to speed up convergence. We evaluate the performance of our SVMwith and without Anderson acceleration on several datasets from the biologydomain and demonstrate that the use of AA significantly improves convergenceand reduces the training loss as the number of iterations increases. Ourfindings provide a promising perspective on the potential of Andersonacceleration in the training of simple machine learning classifiers andunderscore the importance of further research in this area. By showing theeffectiveness of AA in this setting, we aim to inspire more studies thatexplore the applications of AA in classical machine learning.</description><author>Sarwan Ali, Prakash Chourasia, Murray Patterson</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 18:42:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00347v2</guid></item><item><title>BridgeData V2: A Dataset for Robot Learning at Scale</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12952v1</link><description>We introduce BridgeData V2, a large and diverse dataset of roboticmanipulation behaviors designed to facilitate research on scalable robotlearning.

LiDAR generated occupancygrid maps (L-OGMs) offer a robust bird's eye-view scene representation thatfacilitates joint scene predictions without relying on manual labeling unlikecommonly used trajectory prediction frameworks. Prior approaches have optimizeddeterministic L-OGM prediction architectures directly in grid cell space. Whilethese methods have achieved some degree of success in prediction, theyoccasionally grapple with unrealistic and incorrect predictions. We claim thatthe quality and realism of the forecasted occupancy grids can be enhanced withthe use of generative models. We propose a framework that decouples occupancyprediction into: representation learning and stochastic prediction within thelearned latent space. Our approach allows for conditioning the model on otheravailable sensor modalities such as RGB-cameras and high definition maps.

In this study, we present FIESTA (FIbErSegmentation in Tractography using Autoencoders), a reliable and robust, fullyautomated, and easily semi-automatically calibrated pipeline based on deepautoencoders that can dissect and fully populate white matter bundles. Thispipeline is built upon previous works that demonstrated how autoencoders can beused successfully for streamline filtering, bundle segmentation, and streamlinegeneration in tractography. Our proposed method improves bundle segmentationcoverage by recovering hard-to-track bundles with generative sampling throughthe latent space seeding of the subject bundle and the atlas bundle. A latentspace of streamlines is learned using autoencoder-based modeling combined withcontrastive learning. Using an atlas of bundles in standard space (MNI), ourproposed method segments new tractograms using the autoencoder latent distancebetween each tractogram streamline and its closest neighbor bundle in the atlasof bundles. Intra-subject bundle reliability is improved by recoveringhard-to-track streamlines, using the autoencoder to generate new streamlinesthat increase the spatial coverage of each bundle while remaining anatomicallycorrect. Results show that our method is more reliable than state-of-the-artautomated virtual dissection methods such as RecoBundles, RecoBundlesX,TractSeg, White Matter Analysis and XTRACT. Our framework allows for thetransition from one anatomical bundle definition to another with marginalcalibration efforts. Overall, these results show that our framework improvesthe practicality and usability of current state-of-the-art bundle segmentationframework.</description><author>Félix Dumais, Jon Haitz Legarreta, Carl Lemaire, Philippe Poulin, François Rheault, Laurent Petit, Muhamed Barakovic, Stefano Magon, Maxime Descoteaux, Pierre-Marc Jodoin</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 18:29:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00143v3</guid></item><item><title>Perspective-aware Convolution for Monocular 3D Object Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12938v1</link><description>Monocular 3D object detection is a crucial and challenging task forautonomous driving vehicle, while it uses only a single camera image to infer3D objects in the scene.

Recently, the widespread adoption of ambulatory BPmeasurement devices has been driven predominantly by the increased prevalenceof hypertension and its associated risks and clinical conditions. Recentguidelines advocate for regular BP monitoring as part of regular clinicalvisits or even at home. This increased utilization of BP measurementtechnologies has brought up significant concerns, regarding the accuracy ofreported BP values across settings. In this survey, focusing mainly on cuff-based BP monitoring technologies, wehighlight how BP measurements can demonstrate substantial biases and variancesdue to factors such as measurement and device errors, demographics, and bodyhabitus. With these inherent biases, the development of a new generation ofcuff-based BP devices which use artificial-intelligence (AI) has significantpotential. We present future avenues where AI-assisted technologies canleverage the extensive clinical literature on BP-related studies together withthe large collections of BP records available in electronic health records.These resources can be combined with machine learning approaches, includingdeep learning and Bayesian inference, to remove BP measurement biases and toprovide individualized BP-related cardiovascular risk indexes.</description><author>Seyedeh Somayyeh Mousavi, Matthew A.

Several distinct challenges surface when modelling low-count timeseries, particularly low signal-to-noise ratios (when anomaly signatures areprovably undetectable), and non-uniform performance (when average metrics arenot representative of local behaviour). The time series anomaly detectioncommunity currently lacks explicit tooling and processes to model and reliablydetect anomalies in these settings. We address this gap by introducing a novelgenerative procedure for creating benchmark datasets comprising of low-counttime series with anomalous segments. Via a mixture of theoretical and empiricalanalysis, our work explains how widely-used algorithms struggle with thedistribution overlap between normal and anomalous segments. In order tomitigate this shortcoming, we then leverage our findings to demonstrate howanomaly score smoothing consistently improves performance.

Conventionallytrained using the task-specific objective, i.e., cross-entropy loss, promptstend to overfit downstream data distributions and find it challenging tocapture task-agnostic general features from the frozen CLIP. This leads to theloss of the model's original generalization capability. To address this issue,our work introduces a self-regularization framework for prompting calledPromptSRC (Prompting with Self-regulating Constraints). PromptSRC guides theprompts to optimize for both task-specific and task-agnostic generalrepresentations using a three-pronged approach by: (a) regulating promptedrepresentations via mutual agreement maximization with the frozen model, (b)regulating with self-ensemble of prompts over the training trajectory to encodetheir complementary strengths, and (c) regulating with textual diversity tomitigate sample diversity imbalance with the visual branch. To the best of ourknowledge, this is the first regularization framework for prompt learning thatavoids overfitting by jointly attending to pre-trained model features, thetraining trajectory during prompting, and the textual diversity. PromptSRCexplicitly steers the prompts to learn a representation space that maximizesperformance on downstream tasks without compromising CLIP generalization. Weperform extensive experiments on 4 benchmarks where PromptSRC overall performsfavorably well compared to the existing methods.

Although some previous studies have explored the unsupervisedfine-tuning of CLIP, they often rely on prior knowledge in the form of classnames associated with ground truth labels. In this paper, we delve into arealistic unsupervised fine-tuning scenario by assuming that the unlabeled datamight contain out-of-distribution samples from unknown classes. Furthermore, weemphasize the importance of simultaneously enhancing out-of-distributiondetection capabilities alongside the recognition of instances associated withpredefined class labels. To tackle this problem, we present a simple, efficient, and effectivefine-tuning approach called Universal Entropy Optimization (UEO). UEO leveragessample-level confidence to approximately minimize the conditional entropy ofconfident instances and maximize the marginal entropy of less confidentinstances. Apart from optimizing the textual prompts, UEO also incorporatesoptimization of channel-wise affine transformations within the visual branch ofCLIP. Through extensive experiments conducted across 15 domains and 4 differenttypes of prior knowledge, we demonstrate that UEO surpasses baseline methods interms of both generalization and out-of-distribution detection.</description><author>Jian Liang, Lijun Sheng, Zhengbo Wang, Ran He, Tieniu Tan</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 17:47:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12919v1</guid></item><item><title>Evaluating the Vulnerabilities in ML systems in terms of adversarial attacks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12918v1</link><description>There have been recent adversarial attacks that are difficult to find.

Severalcloud providers and other enterprises have made substantial plans of growth intheir datacenters to support these new workloads. One of the key bottleneckresources in datacenters is power, and given the increasing model sizes ofLLMs, they are becoming increasingly power intensive. In this paper, we showthat there is a significant opportunity to oversubscribe power in LLM clusters.Power oversubscription improves the power efficiency of these datacenters,allowing more deployable servers per datacenter, and reduces the deploymenttime, since building new datacenters is slow. We extensively characterize the power consumption patterns of a variety ofLLMs and their configurations. We identify the differences between theinference and training power consumption patterns. Based on our analysis ofthese LLMs, we claim that the average and peak power utilization in LLMclusters for inference should not be very high. Our deductions align with thedata from production LLM clusters, revealing that inference workloads offersubstantial headroom for power oversubscription. However, the stringent set oftelemetry and controls that GPUs offer in a virtualized environment, makes itchallenging to have a reliable and robust power oversubscription mechanism. We propose POLCA, our framework for power oversubscription that is robust,reliable, and readily deployable for GPU clusters.

As asimple solution, blur guidance improves the suitability of intermediate samplesfor their fine-scale information and structures, enabling diffusion models togenerate higher quality samples with a moderate guidance scale. Improving uponthis, Self-Attention Guidance (SAG) uses the intermediate self-attention mapsof diffusion models to enhance their stability and efficacy. Specifically, SAGadversarially blurs only the regions that diffusion models attend to at eachiteration and guides them accordingly.

Thenaive focal length assumptions can harm this task with the incorrectlyformulated projection matrices. To solve this, we propose Zolly, the first3DHMR method focusing on perspective-distorted images. Our approach begins withanalysing the reason for perspective distortion, which we find is mainly causedby the relative location of the human body to the camera center. We propose anew camera model and a novel 2D representation, termed distortion image, whichdescribes the 2D dense distortion scale of the human body. We then estimate thedistance from distortion scale features rather than environment contextfeatures. Afterwards, we integrate the distortion feature with image featuresto reconstruct the body mesh.

However, there have been few endeavors dedicated to theexploration of 1) whether essential linguistic knowledge (e.g., semantics andsyntax) can be extracted during VLP, and 2) how such linguistic knowledgeimpact or enhance the multimodal alignment. In response, here we aim toelucidate the impact of comprehensive linguistic knowledge, including semanticexpression and syntactic structure, on multimodal alignment. Specifically, wedesign and release the SNARE, the first large-scale multimodal alignmentprobing benchmark, to detect the vital linguistic components, e.g., lexical,semantic, and syntax knowledge, containing four tasks: Semantic structure,Negation logic, Attribute ownership, and Relationship composition. Based on ourproposed probing benchmarks, our holistic analyses of five advanced VLP modelsillustrate that the VLP model: i) shows insensitivity towards complex syntaxstructures and relies on content words for sentence comprehension; ii)demonstrates limited comprehension of combinations between sentences andnegations; iii) faces challenges in determining the presence of actions orspatial relationships within visual information and struggles with verifyingthe correctness of triple combinations.

With superb power in modeling the interaction among multimodalinformation, multimodal image synthesis and editing has become a hot researchtopic in recent years. Instead of providing explicit guidance for networktraining, multimodal guidance offers intuitive and flexible means for imagesynthesis and editing. On the other hand, this field is also facing severalchallenges in alignment of multimodal features, synthesis of high-resolutionimages, faithful evaluation metrics, etc. In this survey, we comprehensivelycontextualize the advance of the recent multimodal image synthesis and editingand formulate taxonomies according to data modalities and model types. We startwith an introduction to different guidance modalities in image synthesis andediting, and then describe multimodal image synthesis and editing approachesextensively according to their model types. After that, we describe benchmarkdatasets and evaluation metrics as well as corresponding experimental results.Finally, we provide insights about the current research challenges and possibledirections for future research.

Modern approaches tend to introduce class embeddingsinto semantic segmentation for deeply utilizing category semantics, and regardsupervised class masks as final predictions. In this paper, we explore themechanism of class embeddings and have an insight that more explicit andmeaningful class embeddings can be generated based on class masks purposely.Following this observation, we propose ECENet, a new segmentation paradigm, inwhich class embeddings are obtained and enhanced explicitly during interactingwith multi-stage image features.

LLMs are often applied inFew-Shot Learning (FSL) contexts, where tasks are executed with minimaltraining data. FSL has become popular in many Artificial Intelligence (AI)subdomains, including AI for health. Rare diseases, affecting a small fractionof the population, inherently require FSL techniques due to limited dataavailability, though manual data collection and annotation is costly andtime-consuming. In this paper, we propose Models-Vote Prompting (MVP), aflexible prompting approach for improving the performance of LLM queries in FSLsettings. MVP works by prompting numerous LLMs to perform the same tasks andthen conducting a majority vote on the resulting outputs. This method achievesimproved results to any one model in the ensemble on one-shot rare diseaseidentification and classification tasks. We also release a novel rare diseasedataset for FSL, available to those who agreed to the MIMIC-IV Data UseAgreement (DUA). Furthermore, in using MVP, each model is prompted multipletimes, substantially increasing the time needed for manual annotation, and toaddress this, we assess the feasibility of using JSON for automating generativeLLM evaluation.</description><author>David Oniani, Jordan Hilsman, Hang Dong, Fengyi Gao, Shiven Verma, Yanshan Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 17:09:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12890v1</guid></item><item><title>Inducing Causal Structure for Abstractive Text Summarization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12888v1</link><description>The mainstream of data-driven abstractive summarization models tends toexplore the correlations rather than the causal relationships. Among suchcorrelations, there can be spurious ones which suffer from the language priorlearned from the training corpus and therefore undermine the overalleffectiveness of the learned model. To tackle this issue, we introduce aStructural Causal Model (SCM) to induce the underlying causal structure of thesummarization data. We assume several latent causal factors and non-causalfactors, representing the content and style of the document and summary.Theoretically, we prove that the latent factors in our SCM can be identified byfitting the observed training data under certain conditions. On the basis ofthis, we propose a Causality Inspired Sequence-to-Sequence model (CI-Seq2Seq)to learn the causal representations that can mimic the causal factors, guidingus to pursue causal information for summary generation. The key idea is toreformulate the Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) to fit the joint distribution ofthe document and summary variables from the training corpus.

At the same time, itis found that the trained network has significant information redundancy at allstages of features, which reduces the effectiveness of feature mapping at allstages and is not conducive to the change of the subsequent parameters of thenetwork in the direction of optimality. Therefore, it is possible to obtain amore optimized solution of the network and further improve the classificationaccuracy of the network by designing a loss function for restraining the frontstage features and eliminating the information redundancy of the front stagefeatures .For CNN, this article proposes a multi-stage feature decorrelationloss (MFD Loss), which refines effective features and eliminates informationredundancy by constraining the correlation of features at all stages.Considering that there are many layers in CNN, through experimental comparisonand analysis, MFD Loss acts on multiple front layers of CNN, constrains theoutput features of each layer and each channel, and performs supervisiontraining jointly with classification loss function during network training.Compared with the single Softmax Loss supervised learning, the experiments onseveral commonly used datasets on several typical CNNs prove that theclassification performance of Softmax Loss+MFD Loss is significantly better.Meanwhile, the comparison experiments before and after the combination of MFDLoss and some other typical loss functions verify its good universality.</description><author>Qiuyu Zhu, Xuewen Zu, Chengfei Liu</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 17:00:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12880v1</guid></item><item><title>Easy attention: A simple self-attention mechanism for Transformers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12874v1</link><description>To improve the robustness of transformer neural networks used fortemporal-dynamics prediction of chaotic systems, we propose a novel attentionmechanism called easy attention.

In this paper, we argue that theconnectivity of a tree is not sufficient to characterize a neural network. Thenodes of the same level of a tree cannot be connected with each other, i.e.,these neural unit cannot share information with each other, which is a majordrawback of ANN. Although ANN has been significantly improved in recent yearsto more complex structures, such as the directed acyclic graph (DAG), thesemethods also have unidirectional and acyclic bias for ANN. In this paper, wepropose a method to build a bidirectional complete graph for the nodes in thesame level of an ANN, which yokes the nodes of the same level to formulate aneural module. We call our model as YNN in short. YNN promotes the informationtransfer significantly which obviously helps in improving the performance ofthe method. Our YNN can imitate neural networks much better compared with thetraditional ANN. In this paper, we analyze the existing structural bias of ANNand propose a model YNN to efficiently eliminate such structural bias. In ourmodel, nodes also carry out aggregation and transformation of features, andedges determine the flow of information. We further impose auxiliary sparsityconstraint to the distribution of connectedness, which promotes the learnedstructure to focus on critical connections. Finally, based on the optimizedstructure, we also design small neural module structure based on the minimumcut technique to reduce the computational burden of the YNN model. Thislearning process is compatible with the existing networks and different tasks.The obtained quantitative experimental results reflect that the learnedconnectivity is superior to the traditional NN structure.</description><author>Xinshun Liu, Yizhi Fang, Yichao Jiang</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 16:51:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02157v3</guid></item><item><title>IPA: Inference Pipeline Adaptation to Achieve High Accuracy and Cost-Efficiency</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12871v1</link><description>Efficiently optimizing multi-model inference pipelines for fast, accurate,and cost-effective inference is a crucial challenge in ML production systems,given their tight end-to-end latency requirements. To simplify the explorationof the vast and intricate trade-off space of accuracy and cost in inferencepipelines, providers frequently opt to consider one of them. However, thechallenge lies in reconciling accuracy and cost trade-offs. To address thischallenge and propose a solution to efficiently manage model variants ininference pipelines, we present IPA, an online deep-learning Inference PipelineAdaptation system that efficiently leverages model variants for each deeplearning task. Model variants are different versions of pre-trained models forthe same deep learning task with variations in resource requirements, latency,and accuracy. IPA dynamically configures batch size, replication, and modelvariants to optimize accuracy, minimize costs, and meet user-defined latencySLAs using Integer Programming. It supports multi-objective settings forachieving different trade-offs between accuracy and cost objectives whileremaining adaptable to varying workloads and dynamic traffic patterns.Extensive experiments on a Kubernetes implementation with five real-worldinference pipelines demonstrate that IPA improves normalized accuracy by up to35% with a minimal cost increase of less than 5%.</description><author>Saeid Ghafouri, Kamran Razavi, Mehran Salmani, Alireza Sanaee, Tania Lorido-Botran, Lin Wang, Joseph Doyle, Pooyan Jamshidi</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 16:48:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12871v1</guid></item><item><title>VNI-Net: Vector Neurons-based Rotation-Invariant Descriptor for LiDAR Place Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12870v1</link><description>LiDAR-based place recognition plays a crucial role in SimultaneousLocalization and Mapping (SLAM) and LiDAR localization. Despite the emergence of various deep learning-based and hand-crafting-basedmethods, rotation-induced place recognition failure remains a criticalchallenge. Existing studies address this limitation through specific training strategiesor network structures. However, the former does not produce satisfactory results, while the latterfocuses mainly on the reduced problem of SO(2) rotation invariance. Methodstargeting SO(3) rotation invariance suffer from limitations in discriminationcapability. In this paper, we propose a new method that employs Vector Neurons Network(VNN) to achieve SO(3) rotation invariance. We first extract rotation-equivariant features from neighboring points andmap low-dimensional features to a high-dimensional space through VNN. Afterwards, we calculate the Euclidean and Cosine distance in therotation-equivariant feature space as rotation-invariant feature descriptors. Finally, we aggregate the features using GeM pooling to obtain globaldescriptors. To address the significant information loss when formulatingrotation-invariant descriptors, we propose computing distances between featuresat different layers within the Euclidean space neighborhood. This greatly improves the discriminability of the point cloud descriptorswhile ensuring computational efficiency.

The submaps canbe refined individually in a back-end optimization and optimized jointly torealize submap-level loop closure.

Recently, manyworks have focused on one-shot talking face generation to drive a portrait witha real video, i.e., within-domain reenactment. Straightforwardly applying thosemethods to cross-domain animation will cause inaccurate expression transfer,blur effects, and even apparent artifacts due to the domain shift betweencartoon and real faces. Only a few works attempt to settle cross-domain facereenactment. The most related work AnimeCeleb requires constructing a datasetwith pose vector and cartoon image pairs by animating 3D characters, whichmakes it inapplicable anymore if no paired data is available. In this paper, wepropose a novel method for cross-domain reenactment without paired data.Specifically, we propose a transformer-based framework to align the motionsfrom different domains into a common latent space where motion transfer isconducted via latent code addition. Two domain-specific motion encoders and twolearnable motion base memories are used to capture domain properties. A sourcequery transformer and a driving one are exploited to project domain-specificmotion to the canonical space. The edited motion is projected back to thedomain of the source with a transformer.

Yet, they suffer from imaging limitations arising from theassociated X-ray microtomography (X-ray microCT) process, which inducesdiscrepancies in the properties estimates. Assessment of the kinetic parametersalso raises challenges, as reactive coefficients are critical parameters thatcan cover a wide range of values. We account for these two issues and ensurereliable calibration of pore-scale modeling, based on dynamical microCT images,by integrating uncertainty quantification in the workflow.

Even if the deterioration evolution of structuralelements can be estimated through physics-based deterioration models, theuncertainties involved in the process hurdle the selection of lifecyclemanagement decisions. In this scenario, the collection of relevant informationthrough an efficient monitoring system enables the reduction of uncertainties,ultimately driving more optimal lifecycle decisions. However, a full monitoringinstrumentation implemented on all wind turbines in a farm might becomeunfeasible due to practical and economical constraints. Besides, certain loadmonitoring systems often become defective after a few years of marineenvironment exposure. Addressing the aforementioned concerns, a farm-widevirtual load monitoring scheme directed by a fleet-leader wind turbine offersan attractive solution. Fetched with data retrieved from a fully-instrumentedwind turbine, a model can be trained and then deployed, thus yielding loadpredictions of non-fully monitored wind turbines, from which only standard dataremains available. In this paper, we propose a virtual load monitoringframework formulated via Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and we providerelevant implementation details needed for the construction, training, anddeployment of BNN data-based virtual monitoring models. As opposed to theirdeterministic counterparts, BNNs intrinsically announce the uncertaintiesassociated with generated load predictions and allow to detect inaccurate loadestimations generated for non-fully monitored wind turbines. The proposedvirtual load monitoring is thoroughly tested through an experimental campaignin an operational offshore wind farm and the results demonstrate theeffectiveness of BNN models for fleet-leader-based farm-wide virtualmonitoring.</description><author>N.

However, the existing two-stream networks are only fused at aspecific network layer, which requires a lot of manual attempts to set up. Asthe CNN goes deeper, the two modal features become more and more advanced andabstract, and the fusion occurs at the feature level with a large gap, whichcan easily hurt the performance. In this study, we propose a novel fusionarchitecture called skip-cross networks (SkipcrossNets), which combinesadaptively LiDAR point clouds and camera images without being bound to acertain fusion epoch. Specifically, skip-cross connects each layer to eachlayer in a feed-forward manner, and for each layer, the feature maps of allprevious layers are used as input and its own feature maps are used as input toall subsequent layers for the other modality, enhancing feature propagation andmulti-modal features fusion. This strategy facilitates selection of the mostsimilar feature layers from two data pipelines, providing a complementaryeffect for sparse point cloud features during fusion processes. The network isalso divided into several blocks to reduce the complexity of feature fusion andthe number of model parameters. The advantages of skip-cross fusion weredemonstrated through application to the KITTI and A2D2 datasets, achieving aMaxF score of 96.85% on KITTI and an F1 score of 84.84% on A2D2.

They canprocess large volumes of data quickly, but they do not detect all vocalisationsand they do generate some false positives (vocalisations that are not from thetarget species). Existing wildlife abundance survey methods have been designedspecifically to deal with the first of these mistakes, but current methods ofdealing with false positives are not well-developed. They do not take accountof features of individual vocalisations, some of which are more likely to befalse positives than others. We propose three methods for acoustic spatialcapture-recapture inference that integrate individual-level measures ofconfidence from ML vocalisation identification into the likelihood and henceintegrate ML uncertainty into inference. The methods include a mixture model inwhich species identity is a latent variable. We test the methods by simulationand find that in a scenario based on acoustic data from Hainan gibbons, inwhich ignoring false positives results in 17% positive bias, our methods givenegligible bias and coverage probabilities that are close to the nominal 95%level.</description><author>Yuheng Wang, Juan Ye, David L.

However, previous FAT work has encountered asignificant issue known as catastrophic overfitting when dealing with largeperturbation budgets, \ie the adversarial robustness of models declines to nearzero during training. To address this, we analyze the training process of prior FAT work andobserve that catastrophic overfitting is accompanied by the appearance of lossconvergence outliers. Therefore, we argue a moderately smooth loss convergence process will be astable FAT process that solves catastrophic overfitting. To obtain a smooth loss convergence process, we propose a novel oscillatoryconstraint (dubbed ConvergeSmooth) to limit the loss difference betweenadjacent epochs. The convergence stride of ConvergeSmooth is introduced tobalance convergence and smoothing. Likewise, we design weight centralizationwithout introducing additional hyperparameters other than the loss balancecoefficient. Our proposed methods are attack-agnostic and thus can improve the trainingstability of various FAT techniques. Extensive experiments on popular datasets show that the proposed methodsefficiently avoid catastrophic overfitting and outperform all previous FATmethods.

Concurrently, multi-layer perceptron (MLP)network has regained popularity among researchers due to their comparableresults to ViT, albeit with the exclusion of the resource-intensiveself-attention module. In this work, we propose a novel permutable hybridnetwork for Vol-MedSeg, named PHNet, which capitalizes on the strengths of bothconvolution neural networks (CNNs) and MLP. PHNet addresses the intrinsicisotropy problem of 3D volumetric data by employing a combination of 2D and 3DCNNs to extract local features. Besides, we propose an efficient multi-layerpermute perceptron (MLPP) module that captures long-range dependence whilepreserving positional information. This is achieved through an axisdecomposition operation that permutes the input tensor along different axes,thereby enabling the separate encoding of the positional information.Furthermore, MLPP tackles the resolution sensitivity issue of MLP in Vol-MedSegwith a token segmentation operation, which divides the feature into smallertokens and processes them individually. Extensive experimental results validatethat PHNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with lower computationalcosts on the widely-used yet challenging COVID-19-20 and Synapse benchmarks.The ablation study also demonstrates the effectiveness of PHNet in harnessingthe strengths of both CNNs and MLP.</description><author>Yi Lin, Xiao Fang, Dong Zhang, Kwang-Ting Cheng, Hao Chen</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 16:03:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13111v3</guid></item><item><title>Leveraging Global Binary Masks for Structure Segmentation in Medical Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09107v2</link><description>Deep learning (DL) models for medical image segmentation are highlyinfluenced by intensity variations of input images and lack generalization dueto primarily utilizing pixels' intensity information for inference. Acquiringsufficient training data is another challenge limiting models' applications. Weproposed to leverage the consistency of organs' anatomical shape and positioninformation in medical images. We introduced a framework leveraging recurringanatomical patterns through global binary masks for organ segmentation. Twoscenarios were studied.1) Global binary masks were the only model's (i.e.U-Net) input, forcing exclusively encoding organs' position and shapeinformation for segmentation/localization.2) Global binary masks wereincorporated as an additional channel functioning as position/shape clues tomitigate training data scarcity. Two datasets of the brain and heart CT imageswith their ground-truth were split into (26:10:10) and (12:3:5) for training,validation, and test respectively. Training exclusively on global binary masksled to Dice scores of 0.77(0.06) and 0.85(0.04), with the average Euclidiandistance of 3.12(1.43)mm and 2.5(0.93)mm relative to the center of mass of theground truth for the brain and heart structures respectively. The outcomesindicate that a surprising degree of position and shape information is encodedthrough global binary masks. Incorporating global binary masks led tosignificantly higher accuracy relative to the model trained on only CT imagesin small subsets of training data; the performance improved by 4.3-125.3% and1.3-48.1% for 1-8 training cases of the brain and heart datasets respectively.The findings imply the advantages of utilizing global binary masks for buildinggeneralizable models and to compensate for training data scarcity.</description><author>Mahdieh Kazemimoghadam, Zi Yang, Lin Ma, Mingli Chen, Weiguo Lu, Xuejun Gu</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 16:00:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09107v2</guid></item><item><title>FaceTouch: Detecting hand-to-face touch with supervised contrastive learning to assist in tracing infectious disease</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12840v1</link><description>Through our respiratory system, many viruses and diseases frequently spreadand pass from one person to another.

Defending against SQAs requires a slight but artfulvariation of outputs due to the service purpose for users, who share the sameoutput information with SQAs. In this paper, we propose a real-world defense byUnifying Gradients (UniG) of different data so that SQAs could only probe amuch weaker attack direction that is similar for different samples. Since suchuniversal attack perturbations have been validated as less aggressive than theinput-specific perturbations, UniG protects real-world DNNs by indicatingattackers a twisted and less informative attack direction. We implement UniGefficiently by a Hadamard product module which is plug-and-play. According toextensive experiments on 5 SQAs, 2 adaptive attacks and 7 defense baselines,UniG significantly improves real-world robustness without hurting cleanaccuracy on CIFAR10 and ImageNet. For instance, UniG maintains a model of77.80% accuracy under 2500-query Square attack while the state-of-the-artadversarially-trained model only has 67.34% on CIFAR10. Simultaneously, UniGoutperforms all compared baselines in terms of clean accuracy and achieves thesmallest modification of the model output.

As such, several works have extensivelyanalyzed stochastic optimization with delayed gradients. However, as far as weare aware, no analogous theory is available for min-max optimization, a topicthat has gained recent popularity due to applications in adversarialrobustness, game theory, and reinforcement learning. Motivated by this gap, weexamine the performance of standard min-max optimization algorithms withdelayed gradient updates. First, we show (empirically) that even small delayscan cause prominent algorithms like Extra-gradient (\texttt{EG}) to diverge onsimple instances for which \texttt{EG} guarantees convergence in the absence ofdelays. Our empirical study thus suggests the need for a careful analysis ofdelayed versions of min-max optimization algorithms. Accordingly, undersuitable technical assumptions, we prove that Gradient Descent-Ascent(\texttt{GDA}) and \texttt{EG} with delayed updates continue to guaranteeconvergence to saddle points for convex-concave and strongly convex-stronglyconcave settings.

Additionally,under mild assumptions, we prove that ABPL$^+$ can monotonically decrease thefunction value without strictly restricting the extrapolation parameters andstep size, demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of updating theseblocks in a random order, and we also more obviously and intuitivelydemonstrate that the derivative set of the sequence generated by our algorithmis a critical point set. Moreover, we demonstrate the global convergence aswell as the linear and sublinear convergence rates of our algorithm byutilizing the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (K{\L}) condition. To enhance theeffectiveness and flexibility of our algorithm, we also expand the study to theimprecise version of our algorithm and construct an adaptive extrapolationparameter strategy, which improving its overall performance. We apply ouralgorithm to multiple non-negative matrix factorization with the $\ell_0$ norm,nonnegative tensor decomposition with the $\ell_0$ norm, and perform extensivenumerical experiments to validate its effectiveness and efficiency.</description><author>Weifeng Yang, Wenwen Min</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 15:16:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12126v2</guid></item><item><title>Individual Privacy Accounting with Gaussian Differential Privacy</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15596v2</link><description>Individual privacy accounting enables bounding differential privacy (DP) lossindividually for each participant involved in the analysis. This can beinformative as often the individual privacy losses are considerably smallerthan those indicated by the DP bounds that are based on considering worst-casebounds at each data access. In order to account for the individual privacylosses in a principled manner, we need a privacy accountant for adaptivecompositions of randomised mechanisms, where the loss incurred at a given dataaccess is allowed to be smaller than the worst-case loss. This kind of analysishas been carried out for the R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) by Feldman andZrnic (2021), however not yet for the so-called optimal privacy accountants. Wemake first steps in this direction by providing a careful analysis using theGaussian differential privacy which gives optimal bounds for the Gaussianmechanism, one of the most versatile DP mechanisms. This approach is based ondetermining a certain supermartingale for the hockey-stick divergence and onextending the R\'enyi divergence-based fully adaptive composition results byFeldman and Zrnic. We also consider measuring the individual$(\varepsilon,\delta)$-privacy losses using the so-called privacy lossdistributions. With the help of the Blackwell theorem, we can then make use ofthe RDP analysis to construct an approximative individual$(\varepsilon,\delta)$-accountant.</description><author>Antti Koskela, Marlon Tobaben, Antti Honkela</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 15:00:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15596v2</guid></item><item><title>Job Shop Scheduling Benchmark: Environments and Instances for Learning and Non-learning Methods</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12794v1</link><description>We introduce an open-source GitHub repository containing comprehensivebenchmarks for a wide range of machine scheduling problems, including Job ShopScheduling (JSP), Flow Shop Scheduling (FSP), Flexible Job Shop Scheduling(FJSP), FJSP with Assembly constraints (FAJSP), FJSP with Sequence-DependentSetup Times (FJSP-SDST), and the online FJSP (with online job arrivals).

In this work, we explore the computational benefits ofmediating recurrent communication via interneurons compared with directrecurrent connections. To this end, we consider two mathematically tractablerecurrent linear neural networks that statistically whiten their inputs -- onewith direct recurrent connections and the other with interneurons that mediaterecurrent communication. By analyzing the corresponding continuous synapticdynamics and numerically simulating the networks, we show that the network withinterneurons is more robust to initialization than the network with directrecurrent connections in the sense that the convergence time for the synapticdynamics in the network with interneurons (resp. direct recurrent connections)scales logarithmically (resp. linearly) with the spectrum of theirinitialization. Our results suggest that interneurons are computationallyuseful for rapid adaptation to changing input statistics. Interestingly, thenetwork with interneurons is an overparameterized solution of the whiteningobjective for the network with direct recurrent connections, so our results canbe viewed as a recurrent linear neural network analogue of the implicitacceleration phenomenon observed in overparameterized feedforward linear neuralnetworks.</description><author>David Lipshutz, Cengiz Pehlevan, Dmitri B.

However, runtime context inference ischallenging since it requires timely and accurate detection of the interactionsamong the tools and objects in the surgical scene based on the segmentation ofvideo data. On the other hand, existing state-of-the-art video segmentationmethods are often biased against infrequent classes and fail to providetemporal consistency for segmented masks. This can negatively impact thecontext inference and accurate detection of critical states. In this study, wepropose a solution to these challenges using a Space Time CorrespondenceNetwork (STCN). STCN is a memory network that performs binary segmentation andminimizes the effects of class imbalance. The use of a memory bank in STCNallows for the utilization of past image and segmentation information, therebyensuring consistency of the masks. Our experiments using the publicly availableJIGSAWS dataset demonstrate that STCN achieves superior segmentationperformance for objects that are difficult to segment, such as needle andthread, and improves context inference compared to the state-of-the-art. Wealso demonstrate that segmentation and context inference can be performed atruntime without compromising performance.</description><author>Zongyu Li, Ian Reyes, Homa Alemzadeh</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 14:44:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12789v1</guid></item><item><title>Single-shot Bayesian approximation for neural networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12785v1</link><description>Deep neural networks (NNs) are known for their high-prediction performances.However, NNs are prone to yield unreliable predictions when encounteringcompletely new situations without indicating their uncertainty. Bayesianvariants of NNs (BNNs), such as Monte Carlo (MC) dropout BNNs, do provideuncertainty measures and simultaneously increase the prediction performance.The only disadvantage of BNNs is their higher computation time during test timebecause they rely on a sampling approach. Here we present a single-shot MCdropout approximation that preserves the advantages of BNNs while being as fastas NNs. Our approach is based on moment propagation (MP) and allows toanalytically approximate the expected value and the variance of the MC dropoutsignal for commonly used layers in NNs, i.e. convolution, max pooling, dense,softmax, and dropout layers. The MP approach can convert an NN into a BNNwithout re-training given the NN has been trained with standard dropout. Weevaluate our approach on different benchmark datasets and a simulated toyexample in a classification and regression setting. We demonstrate that oursingle-shot MC dropout approximation resembles the point estimate and theuncertainty estimate of the predictive distribution that is achieved with an MCapproach, while being fast enough for real-time deployments of BNNs. We showthat using part of the saved time to combine our MP approach with deep ensembletechniques does further improve the uncertainty measures.</description><author>Kai Brach, Beate Sick, Oliver Dürr</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 14:40:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12785v1</guid></item><item><title>Evaluation of ChatGPT on Biomedical Tasks: A Zero-Shot Comparison with Fine-Tuned Generative Transformers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04504v3</link><description>ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI.

Yet, they suffer from security-related issues such asadversarial examples and poisoning (backdoor) attacks. A deep learning modelmay be poisoned by training with backdoored data or by modifying inner networkparameters. Then, a backdoored model performs as expected when receiving aclean input, but it misclassifies when receiving a backdoored input stampedwith a pre-designed pattern called "trigger". Unfortunately, it is difficult todistinguish between clean and backdoored models without prior knowledge of thetrigger. This paper proposes a backdoor detection method by utilizing a specialtype of adversarial attack, universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), and itssimilarities with a backdoor trigger. We observe an intuitive phenomenon: UAPsgenerated from backdoored models need fewer perturbations to mislead the modelthan UAPs from clean models. UAPs of backdoored models tend to exploit theshortcut from all classes to the target class, built by the backdoor trigger.We propose a novel method called Universal Soldier for Backdoor detection (USB)and reverse engineering potential backdoor triggers via UAPs. Experiments on345 models trained on several datasets show that USB effectively detects theinjected backdoor and provides comparable or better results thanstate-of-the-art methods.</description><author>Xiaoyun Xu, Oguzhan Ersoy, Stjepan Picek</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 14:27:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00747v3</guid></item><item><title>LISTER: Neighbor Decoding for Length-Insensitive Scene Text Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12774v1</link><description>The diversity in length constitutes a significant characteristic of text. Dueto the long-tail distribution of text lengths, most existing methods for scenetext recognition (STR) only work well on short or seen-length text, lacking thecapability of recognizing longer text or performing length extrapolation. Thisis a crucial issue, since the lengths of the text to be recognized are usuallynot given in advance in real-world applications, but it has not been adequatelyinvestigated in previous works. Therefore, we propose in this paper a methodcalled Length-Insensitive Scene TExt Recognizer (LISTER), which remedies thelimitation regarding the robustness to various text lengths. Specifically, aNeighbor Decoder is proposed to obtain accurate character attention maps withthe assistance of a novel neighbor matrix regardless of the text lengths.Besides, a Feature Enhancement Module is devised to model the long-rangedependency with low computation cost, which is able to perform iterations withthe neighbor decoder to enhance the feature map progressively. To the best ofour knowledge, we are the first to achieve effective length-insensitive scenetext recognition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LISTERalgorithm exhibits obvious superiority on long text recognition and the abilityfor length extrapolation, while comparing favourably with the previousstate-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks for STR (mainly short text).</description><author>Changxu Cheng, Peng Wang, Cheng Da, Qi Zheng, Cong Yao</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 14:26:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12774v1</guid></item><item><title>HypBO: Expert-Guided Chemist-in-the-Loop Bayesian Search for New Materials</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11787v2</link><description>Robotics and automation offer massive accelerations for solving intractable,multivariate scientific problems such as materials discovery, but the availablesearch spaces can be dauntingly large.

Here we exploit experthuman knowledge in the form of hypotheses to direct Bayesian searches morequickly to promising regions of chemical space. Previous methods have usedunderlying distributions derived from existing experimental measurements, whichis unfeasible for new, unexplored scientific tasks. Also, such distributionscannot capture intricate hypotheses.

This study addresses the problem of the most popularexception handling that temporal-difference (TD) learning performs at suchtermination. That is, by forcibly assuming zero value after termination,unintentionally implicit underestimation or overestimation occurs, depending onthe reward design in the normal states. When the episode is terminated due totask failure, the failure may be highly valued with the unintentionaloverestimation, and the wrong policy may be acquired. Although this problem canbe avoided by paying attention to the reward design, it is essential inpractical use of TD learning to review the exception handling at termination.This paper therefore proposes a method to intentionally underestimate the valueafter termination to avoid learning failures due to the unintentionaloverestimation. In addition, the degree of underestimation is adjustedaccording to the degree of stationarity at termination, thereby preventingexcessive exploration due to the intentional underestimation. Simulations andreal robot experiments showed that the proposed method can stably obtain theoptimal policies for various tasks and reward designs.https://youtu.be/AxXr8uFOe7M</description><author>Taisuke Kobayashi</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 14:21:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12772v1</guid></item><item><title>WavMark: Watermarking for Audio Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12770v1</link><description>Recent breakthroughs in zero-shot voice synthesis have enabled imitating aspeaker's voice using just a few seconds of recording while maintaining a highlevel of realism.

However, limitedmemory capacity is one of the most common drawbacks of processinghigh-resolution 3D volumetric data. 3D volumes are usually cropped or downsizedfirst before processing, which can result in a loss of resolution, increaseclass imbalance, and affect the performance of the segmentation algorithms. Inthis paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning approach called IP-UNet.IP-UNet is a UNet-based model that performs multi-class segmentation onIntensity Projection (IP) of 3D volumetric data instead of the memory-consuming3D volumes. IP-UNet uses limited memory capability for training without losingthe original 3D image resolution. We compare the performance of three models interms of segmentation accuracy and computational cost: 1) Slice-by-slice 2Dsegmentation of the CT scan images using a conventional 2D UNet model. 2)IP-UNet that operates on data obtained by merging the extracted MaximumIntensity Projection (MIP), Closest Vessel Projection (CVP), and AverageIntensity Projection (AvgIP) representations of the source 3D volumes, thenapplying the UNet model on the output IP images. 3) 3D-UNet model directlyreads the 3D volumes constructed from a series of CT scan images and outputsthe 3D volume of the predicted segmentation. We test the performance of thesemethods on 3D volumetric images for automatic breast calcification detection.Experimental results show that IP-Unet can achieve similar segmentationaccuracy with 3D-Unet but with much better performance. It reduces the trainingtime by 70\% and memory consumption by 92\%.</description><author>Nyothiri Aung, Tahar Kechadi, Liming Chen, Sahraoui Dhelim</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 14:08:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12761v1</guid></item><item><title>On the Generalization of PINNs outside the training domain and the Hyperparameters influencing it</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07557v2</link><description>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are Neural Network architecturestrained to emulate solutions of differential equations without the necessity ofsolution data.

However, the majority of existing research designs graphpooling operators only from the perspective of nodes while disregarding theoriginal edge features, in a way that not only confines graph poolingapplication scenarios, but also diminishes its ability to capture criticalsubstructures. In this study, a clustering graph pooling method that firstsupports multidimensional edge features, called Edge-aware hard clusteringgraph pooling (EHCPool), is developed. EHCPool proposes the first'Edge-to-node' score evaluation criterion based on edge features to assess nodefeature significance. To more effectively capture the critical subgraphs, anovel Iteration n-top strategy is further designed to adaptively learn sparsehard clustering assignments for graphs. Subsequently, an innovative N-EAggregation strategy is presented to aggregate node and edge featureinformation in each independent subgraph.
