Existing approachessuffer from a trade-off: generalist agents excel at planning but perform poorlyin execution, while specialized agents demonstrate the opposite weakness.Recent compositional frameworks attempt to bridge this gap by combining aplanner and an actor, but they are typically static and non-trainable, whichprevents adaptation from experience. This is a critical limitation given thescarcity of high-quality data in scientific domains. To address theselimitations, we introduce CODA, a novel and trainable compositional frameworkthat integrates a generalist planner (Cerebrum) with a specialist executor(Cerebellum), trained via a dedicated two-stage pipeline. In the first stage,Specialization, we apply a decoupled GRPO approach to train an expert plannerfor each scientific application individually, bootstrapping from a small set oftask trajectories. In the second stage, Generalization, we aggregate allsuccessful trajectories from the specialized experts to build a consolidateddataset, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning of the final planner.This equips CODA with both robust execution and cross-domain generalization.Evaluated on four challenging applications from the ScienceBoard benchmark,CODA significantly outperforms baselines and establishes a new state of the artamong open-source models.</description><author>Zeyi Sun, Yuhang Cao, Jianze Liang, Qiushi Sun, Ziyu Liu, Zhixiong Zhang, Yuhang Zang, Xiaoyi Dong, Kai Chen, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 17:59:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20096v1</guid></item><item><title>Discrete-Guided Diffusion for Scalable and Safe Multi-Robot Motion Planning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20095v1</link><description>Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) involves generating collision-freetrajectories for multiple robots operating in a shared continuous workspace.While discrete multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods are broadly adopted dueto their scalability, their coarse discretization severely limits trajectoryquality. In contrast, continuous optimization-based planners offerhigher-quality paths but suffer from the curse of dimensionality, resulting inpoor scalability with respect to the number of robots. This paper tackles thelimitations of these two approaches by introducing a novel framework thatintegrates discrete MAPF solvers with constrained generative diffusion models.The resulting framework, called Discrete-Guided Diffusion (DGD), has three keycharacteristics: (1) it decomposes the original nonconvex MRMP problem intotractable subproblems with convex configuration spaces, (2) it combinesdiscrete MAPF solutions with constrained optimization techniques to guidediffusion models capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies among robots, and(3) it incorporates a lightweight constraint repair mechanism to ensuretrajectory feasibility. The proposed method sets a new state-of-the-artperformance in large-scale, complex environments, scaling to 100 robots whileachieving planning efficiency and high success rates.</description><author>Jinhao Liang, Sven Koenig, Ferdinando Fioretto</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 17:59:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20095v1</guid></item><item><title>LGR2: Language Guided Reward Relabeling for Accelerating Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05881v6</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in logicalreasoning, in-context learning, and code generation. However, translatingnatural language instructions into effective robotic control policies remains asignificant challenge, especially for tasks requiring long-horizon planning andoperating under sparse reward conditions. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning(HRL) provides a natural framework to address this challenge in robotics;however, it typically suffers from non-stationarity caused by the changingbehavior of the lower-level policy during training, destabilizing higher-levelpolicy learning. We introduce LGR2, a novel HRL framework that leverages LLMsto generate language-guided reward functions for the higher-level policy. Bydecoupling high-level reward generation from low-level policy changes, LGR2fundamentally mitigates the non-stationarity problem in off-policy HRL,enabling stable and efficient learning. To further enhance sample efficiency insparse environments, we integrate goal-conditioned hindsight experiencerelabeling. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world roboticnavigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate LGR2 outperforms bothhierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines, achieving over 55% success rateson challenging tasks and robust transfer to real robots, without additionalfine-tuning.</description><author>Utsav Singh, Pramit Bhattacharyya, Vinay P.

While radicalization has been studiedextensively within the context of specific ideologies, our ability toaccurately characterize extremism in more generalizable terms remainsunderdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a novel method for extracting andanalyzing extremist discourse across a range of online community forums. Byfocusing on verbal behavioral signatures of extremist traits, we develop aframework for quantifying extremism at both user and community levels. Ourresearch identifies 11 distinct factors, which we term ``The ExtremistEleven,'' as a generalized psychosocial model of extremism. Applying our methodto various online communities, we demonstrate an ability to characterizeideologically diverse communities across the 11 extremist traits. Wedemonstrate the power of this method by analyzing user histories from membersof the incel community. We find that our framework accurately predicts whichusers join the incel community up to 10 months before their actual entry withan AUC of $&gt;0.6$, steadily increasing to AUC ~0.9 three to four months beforethe event. Further, we find that upon entry into an extremist forum, the userstend to maintain their level of extremism within the community, while stillremaining distinguishable from the general online discourse. Our findingscontribute to the study of extremism by introducing a more holistic,cross-ideological approach that transcends traditional, trait-specific models.</description><author>Allison Lahnala, Vasudha Varadarajan, Lucie Flek, H.

However, accurate speciesidentification is challenging due to domain shifts between curated images andnoisy field imagery. We propose a lightweight classification approach,combining limited expert-labelled field data with knowledge distillation fromthe high-performance BioCLIP2 foundation model into a ConvNeXt-tinyarchitecture. Experiments on 101 Danish moth species from AMI camera systemsdemonstrate that BioCLIP2 substantially outperforms other methods and that ourdistilled lightweight model achieves comparable accuracy with significantlyreduced computational cost.

To address this gap, we proposeAudioStory, a unified framework that integrates large language models (LLMs)with TTA systems to generate structured, long-form audio narratives. AudioStorypossesses strong instruction-following reasoning generation capabilities. Itemploys LLMs to decompose complex narrative queries into temporally orderedsub-tasks with contextual cues, enabling coherent scene transitions andemotional tone consistency. AudioStory has two appealing features: (1)Decoupled bridging mechanism: AudioStory disentangles LLM-diffusercollaboration into two specialized components, i.e., a bridging query forintra-event semantic alignment and a residual query for cross-event coherencepreservation. (2) End-to-end training: By unifying instruction comprehensionand audio generation within a single end-to-end framework, AudioStoryeliminates the need for modular training pipelines while enhancing synergybetween components. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark AudioStory-10K,encompassing diverse domains such as animated soundscapes and natural soundnarratives. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AudioStory on bothsingle-audio generation and narrative audio generation, surpassing prior TTAbaselines in both instruction-following ability and audio fidelity.

Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concernsand a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can faceinsufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, whilebeing efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlookcompounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novelparadigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on realdatasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with syntheticobservations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our keyidea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter bygenerating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, andspeed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observationsthat best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-basedweighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation ofcausal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequentialinteractive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlatedwith closed-loop simulations ($R^2=0.8$) than the best existing open-loopapproach ($R^2=0.7$). We also establish a public leaderboard for the communityto benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation.

Yet existing datasets remaininsufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to (1) the lack of scalabletask generation methods and (2) oversimplified simulation environments. Wepresent RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable framework for automated, large-scalegeneration of diverse and realistic data, together with unified evaluationprotocols for dual-arm manipulation. At its core is RoboTwin-OD, an objectlibrary of 731 instances across 147 categories with semantic andmanipulation-relevant annotations. Building on this, we design an expert datasynthesis pipeline that leverages multimodal language models (MLLMs) andsimulation-in-the-loop refinement to automatically generate task-levelexecution code. To improve sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 appliesstructured domain randomization along five axes: clutter, lighting, background,tabletop height, and language, enhancing data diversity and policy robustness.The framework is instantiated across 50 dual-arm tasks and five robotembodiments. Empirically, it yields a 10.9% gain in code generation successrate. For downstream policy learning, a VLA model trained with synthetic dataplus only 10 real demonstrations achieves a 367% relative improvement over the10-demo baseline, while zero-shot models trained solely on synthetic dataobtain a 228% gain. These results highlight the effectiveness of RoboTwin 2.0in strengthening sim-to-real transfer and robustness to environmentalvariations. We release the data generator, benchmark, dataset, and code tosupport scalable research in robust bimanual manipulation.

Prior workdemonstrates the vulnerability of RAG systems by misleading them intogenerating attacker-chosen outputs through poisoning the knowledge base.However, this paper uncovers that such attacks could be mitigated by the strong\textit{self-correction ability (SCA)} of modern LLMs, which can reject falsecontext once properly configured. This SCA poses a significant challenge forattackers aiming to manipulate RAG systems. In contrast to previous poisoning methods, which primarily target theknowledge base, we introduce \textsc{DisarmRAG}, a new poisoning paradigm thatcompromises the retriever itself to suppress the SCA and enforceattacker-chosen outputs. This compromisation enables the attacker tostraightforwardly embed anti-SCA instructions into the context provided to thegenerator, thereby bypassing the SCA. To this end, we present acontrastive-learning-based model editing technique that performs localized andstealthy edits, ensuring the retriever returns a malicious instruction only forspecific victim queries while preserving benign retrieval behavior. To furtherstrengthen the attack, we design an iterative co-optimization framework thatautomatically discovers robust instructions capable of bypassing prompt-baseddefenses. We extensively evaluate DisarmRAG across six LLMs and three QAbenchmarks. Our results show near-perfect retrieval of malicious instructions,which successfully suppress SCA and achieve attack success rates exceeding 90\%under diverse defensive prompts. Also, the edited retriever remains stealthyunder several detection methods, highlighting the urgent need forretriever-centric defenses.</description><author>Yanbo Dai, Zhenlan Ji, Zongjie Li, Kuan Li, Shuai Wang</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 17:49:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20083v1</guid></item><item><title>Approximate Lifted Model Construction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20784v3</link><description>Probabilistic relational models such as parametric factor graphs enableefficient (lifted) inference by exploiting the indistinguishability of objects.In lifted inference, a representative of indistinguishable objects is used forcomputations. To obtain a relational (i.e., lifted) representation, theAdvanced Colour Passing (ACP) algorithm is the state of the art. The ACPalgorithm, however, requires underlying distributions, encoded aspotential-based factorisations, to exactly match to identify and exploitindistinguishabilities. Hence, ACP is unsuitable for practical applicationswhere potentials learned from data inevitably deviate even if associatedobjects are indistinguishable. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the$\varepsilon$-Advanced Colour Passing ($\varepsilon$-ACP) algorithm, whichallows for a deviation of potentials depending on a hyperparameter$\varepsilon$. $\varepsilon$-ACP efficiently uncovers and exploitsindistinguishabilities that are not exact. We prove that the approximationerror induced by $\varepsilon$-ACP is strictly bounded and our experiments showthat the approximation error is close to zero in practice.</description><author>Malte Luttermann, Jan Speller, Marcel Gehrke, Tanya Braun, Ralf MÃ¶ller, Mattis Hartwig</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 17:48:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20784v3</guid></item><item><title>Evaluating the Fitness of Ontologies for the Task of Question Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07994v2</link><description>Ontology-based question generation is an important application ofsemantic-aware systems that enables the creation of large question banks fordiverse learning environments. The effectiveness of these systems, both interms of the calibre and cognitive difficulty of the resulting questions,depends heavily on the quality and modelling approach of the underlyingontologies, making it crucial to assess their fitness for this task. To date,there has been no comprehensive investigation into the specific ontologyaspects or characteristics that affect the question generation process.Therefore, this paper proposes a set of requirements and task-specific metricsfor evaluating the fitness of ontologies for question generation tasks inpedagogical settings. Using the ROMEO methodology (a structured framework usedfor identifying task-specific metrics), a set of evaluation metrics have beenderived from an expert assessment of questions generated by a questiongeneration model. To validate the proposed metrics, we apply them to a set ofontologies previously used in question generation to illustrate how the metricscores align with and complement findings reported in earlier studies. Theanalysis confirms that ontology characteristics significantly impact theeffectiveness of question generation, with different ontologies exhibitingvarying performance levels. This highlights the importance of assessingontology quality with respect to Automatic Question Generation (AQG) tasks.</description><author>Samah Alkhuzaey, Floriana Grasso, Terry R.

Nevertheless, abnormal nodes,which significantly deviate from most of the network concerning patterns orbehaviors, can lead to grave consequences. Therefore, it is imperative todesign efficient online learning algorithms that robustly learn users'preferences while simultaneously detecting anomalies. We introduce a novel bandit algorithm to address this problem. Throughnetwork knowledge, the method characterizes the users' preferences andresiduals of feature information. By learning and analyzing these preferencesand residuals, it develops a personalized recommendation strategy for each userand simultaneously detects anomalies.

However, prevailing VLA decoderseither generate actions autoregressively in a fixed left-to-right order orattach continuous diffusion or flow matching heads outside the backbone,demanding specialized training and iterative sampling that hinder a unified,scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a single-transformerpolicy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion and istrained with the same cross-entropy objective as the VLM backbone. The designretains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining nativelycompatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves anadaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder onesand uses secondary remasking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinementrounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. Thisunified decoder preserves pretrained vision language priors, supports paralleldecoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number offunction evaluations.

The system consists of a globalcontroller (GC), and N local controllers (LCs). The GC operates at a slowertimescale, imposing budget constraints on the actions of LCs, which function ata faster timescale. Applications can be found in energy grid planning, wildfiremanagement, and other decentralized resource allocation problems. We proposeand analyze two optimization frameworks for this setting: COpt and FOpt. InCOpt, both GC and LCs together optimize infinite-horizon discounted rewards,while in FOpt the LCs optimize finite-horizon episodic rewards, and the GCoptimizes infinite-horizon rewards. Although both frameworks share identicalreward functions, their differing horizons can lead to different optimalpolicies. In particular, FOpt grants greater autonomy to LCs by allowing theirpolicies to be determined only by local objectives, unlike COpt. To ourknowledge, these frameworks have not been studied in the literature. Weestablish the formulations, prove the existence of optimal policies, and provethe convergence of their value iteration algorithms. We further show that COptalways achieves a higher value function than FOpt and derive explicit bounds ontheir difference. Finally, we establish a set of sufficient structuralconditions under which the two frameworks become equivalent.</description><author>Kesav Kaza, Ramachandran Anantharaman, Rahul Meshram</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 17:30:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22971v3</guid></item><item><title>11Plus-Bench: Demystifying Multimodal LLM Spatial Reasoning with Cognitive-Inspired Analysis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20068v1</link><description>For human cognitive process, spatial reasoning and perception are closelyentangled, yet the nature of this interplay remains underexplored in theevaluation of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While recent MLLMadvancements show impressive performance on reasoning, their capacity forhuman-like spatial cognition remains an open question. In this work, weintroduce a systematic evaluation framework to assess the spatial reasoningabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs relative to human performance. Central toour work is 11Plus-Bench, a high-quality benchmark derived from realisticstandardized spatial aptitude tests. 11Plus-Bench also features fine-grainedexpert annotations of both perceptual complexity and reasoning process,enabling detailed instance-level analysis of model behavior. Through extensiveexperiments across 14 MLLMs and human evaluation, we find that current MLLMsexhibit early signs of spatial cognition. Despite a large performance gapcompared to humans, MLLMs' cognitive profiles resemble those of humans in thatcognitive effort correlates strongly with reasoning-related complexity.However, instance-level performance in MLLMs remains largely random, whereashuman correctness is highly predictable and shaped by abstract patterncomplexity.

However, exact conditional simulation from thispredictive distribution is intractable or inefficient for many spatial processmodels. In this paper, we propose neural conditional simulation (NCS), ageneral method for spatial conditional simulation that is based on neuraldiffusion models. Specifically, using spatial masks, we implement a conditionalscore-based diffusion model that evolves Gaussian noise into samples from apredictive distribution when given a partially observed spatial field andspatial process parameters as inputs. The diffusion model relies on a neuralnetwork that only requires unconditional samples from the spatial process fortraining. Once trained, the diffusion model is amortized with respect to theobservations in the partially observed field, the number and locations of thoseobservations, and the spatial process parameters, and can therefore be used toconditionally simulate from a broad class of predictive distributions withoutretraining the neural network. We assess the NCS-generated simulations againstsimulations from the true conditional distribution of a Gaussian process model,and against Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations from a Brown--Resnickprocess model for spatial extremes. In the latter case, we show that it is moreefficient and accurate to conditionally simulate using NCS than classical MCMCtechniques implemented in standard software. We conclude that NCS enablesefficient and accurate conditional simulation from spatial predictivedistributions that are challenging to sample from using traditional methods.</description><author>Julia Walchessen, Andrew Zammit-Mangion, RaphaÃ«l Huser, Mikael Kuusela</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 17:21:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20067v1</guid></item><item><title>PAUL: Uncertainty-Guided Partition and Augmentation for Robust Cross-View Geo-Localization under Noisy Correspondence</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20066v1</link><description>Cross-view geo-localization is a critical task for UAV navigation, eventdetection, and aerial surveying, as it enables matching between drone-capturedand satellite imagery. Most existing approaches embed multi-modal data into ajoint feature space to maximize the similarity of paired images. However, thesemethods typically assume perfect alignment of image pairs during training,which rarely holds true in real-world scenarios. In practice, factors such asurban canyon effects, electromagnetic interference, and adverse weatherfrequently induce GPS drift, resulting in systematic alignment shifts whereonly partial correspondences exist between pairs. Despite its prevalence, thissource of noisy correspondence has received limited attention in currentresearch. In this paper, we formally introduce and address the NoisyCorrespondence on Cross-View Geo-Localization (NC-CVGL) problem, aiming tobridge the gap between idealized benchmarks and practical applications. To thisend, we propose PAUL (Partition and Augmentation by Uncertainty Learning), anovel framework that partitions and augments training data based on estimateddata uncertainty through uncertainty-aware co-augmentation and evidentialco-training. Specifically, PAUL selectively augments regions with highcorrespondence confidence and utilizes uncertainty estimation to refine featurelearning, effectively suppressing noise from misaligned pairs. Distinct fromtraditional filtering or label correction, PAUL leverages both data uncertaintyand loss discrepancy for targeted partitioning and augmentation, thus providingrobust supervision for noisy samples. Comprehensive experiments validate theeffectiveness of individual components in PAUL,which consistently achievessuperior performance over other competitive noisy-correspondence-driven methodsin various noise ratios.</description><author>Zheng Li, Yanming Guo, WenZhe Liu, Xueyi Zhang, Zhaoyun Ding, Long Xu, Mingrui Lao</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 17:21:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20066v1</guid></item><item><title>Patch Progression Masked Autoencoder with Fusion CNN Network for Classifying Evolution Between Two Pairs of 2D OCT Slices</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20064v1</link><description>Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a prevalent eye condition affectingvisual acuity. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatmentshave been effective in slowing the progression of neovascular AMD, with betteroutcomes achieved through timely diagnosis and consistent monitoring. Trackingthe progression of neovascular activity in OCT scans of patients with exudativeAMD allows for the development of more personalized and effective treatmentplans. This was the focus of the Monitoring Age-related Macular DegenerationProgression in Optical Coherence Tomography (MARIO) challenge, in which weparticipated. In Task 1, which involved classifying the evolution between twopairs of 2D slices from consecutive OCT acquisitions, we employed a fusion CNNnetwork with model ensembling to further enhance the model's performance. ForTask 2, which focused on predicting progression over the next three monthsbased on current exam data, we proposed the Patch Progression MaskedAutoencoder that generates an OCT for the next exam and then classifies theevolution between the current OCT and the one generated using our solution fromTask 1. The results we achieved allowed us to place in the Top 10 for bothtasks.

Process reward models address this byproviding step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two majordrawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providingexplanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasetslimits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise rewardmodeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself.

We introduce OpenM3D, a novel open-vocabulary multi-viewindoor 3D object detector trained without human annotations. In particular,OpenM3D is a single-stage detector adapting the 2D-induced voxel features fromthe ImGeoNet model. To support OV, it is jointly trained with a class-agnostic3D localization loss requiring high-quality 3D pseudo boxes and avoxel-semantic alignment loss requiring diverse pre-trained CLIP features. Wefollow the training setting of OV-3DET where posed RGB-D images are given butno human annotations of 3D boxes or classes are available. We propose a 3DPseudo Box Generation method using a graph embedding technique that combines 2Dsegments into coherent 3D structures. Our pseudo-boxes achieve higher precisionand recall than other methods, including the method proposed in OV-3DET. Wefurther sample diverse CLIP features from 2D segments associated with eachcoherent 3D structure to align with the corresponding voxel feature. The key totraining a highly accurate single-stage detector requires both losses to belearned toward high-quality targets. At inference, OpenM3D, a highly efficientdetector, requires only multi-view images for input and demonstrates superioraccuracy and speed (0.3 sec. per scene) on ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes indoorbenchmarks compared to existing methods. We outperform a strong two-stagemethod that leverages our class-agnostic detector with a ViT CLIP-based OVclassifier and a baseline incorporating multi-view depth estimator on bothaccuracy and speed.</description><author>Peng-Hao Hsu, Ke Zhang, Fu-En Wang, Tao Tu, Ming-Feng Li, Yu-Lun Liu, Albert Y.

To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many worksemploy Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trainedstable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, dueto the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform differentgenerative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methodsto fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimalperformance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step DiffusionNetwork for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,which projects the same image into different latent features based ontimesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,the student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of thepre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generativecapabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at differenttimesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of thestudent model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistentgenerative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, thoughutilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method cannaturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism bychanging the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that ourmethod achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR resultswith only a single step.</description><author>Tainyi Zhang, Zheng-Peng Duan, Peng-Tao Jiang, Bo Li, Ming-Ming Cheng, Chun-Le Guo, Chongyi Li</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 17:00:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16557v2</guid></item><item><title>A Robust Real-Time Lane Detection Method with Fog-Enhanced Feature Fusion for Foggy Conditions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06121v9</link><description>Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems(ADAS). Existing lane detection algorithms generally perform well underfavorable weather conditions.

While it is common to decrease the learning rate for smaller batch sizes,other hyperparameters are often held fixed. In this work, we revisit smallbatch sizes all the way down to batch size one, and we propose a rule forscaling Adam hyperparameters to small batch sizes. In particular, rather thanholding the decay rate of the second moment fixed across batch sizes, wepropose to hold its half-life fixed in terms of tokens. We find that smallbatch sizes (1) train stably, (2) are consistently more robust tohyperparameter choices, (3) achieve equal or better per-FLOP performance thanlarger batch sizes, and (4) notably enable stable language model training withvanilla SGD, even without momentum, despite storing no optimizer state.Building on these results, we provide practical recommendations for selecting abatch size and setting optimizer hyperparameters. We further recommend againstgradient accumulation unless training on multiple devices with multiple modelreplicas. Finally, we show that a small batch size combined with an optimizerwith a small state size can provide the performance benefits of fullfine-tuning while maintaining a similar memory footprint to LoRA.</description><author>Martin Marek, Sanae Lotfi, Aditya Somasundaram, Andrew Gordon Wilson, Micah Goldblum</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 16:54:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07101v2</guid></item><item><title>AraHealthQA 2025 Shared Task Description Paper</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20047v1</link><description>We introduce {AraHealthQA 2025}, the {Comprehensive Arabic Health QuestionAnswering Shared Task}, held in conjunction with {ArabicNLP 2025} (co-locatedwith EMNLP 2025).

While the typical standard federated learning (FL)supports data privacy, the central server requirement creates a single point ofattack and vulnerability to poisoning attacks. Generalizing the result in thisdirection to 70B-parameter models in the heterogeneous, trustless environmentshas turned out to be a huge, yet unbroken bottleneck. This paper introducesFLock, a decentralized framework for secure and efficient collaborative LLMfine-tuning. Integrating a blockchain-based trust layer with economicincentives, FLock replaces the central aggregator with a secure, auditableprotocol for cooperation among untrusted parties. We present the firstempirical validation of fine-tuning a 70B LLM in a secure, multi-domain,decentralized setting.

Wedemonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on aUnitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world.

While increasing the number of sampledframes is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon whereexcessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. Toaddress these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novelpost-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFPemploys an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 andCLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into singlerepresentatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce alightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context withminimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBenchand VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approachdemonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and totalinput tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-qualityset of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improvesaccuracy over baselines that use more frames.

Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitablyreuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as eachvertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively longtoken sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we proposean efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices andfaces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ anautoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token countto approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a singlestep by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacencymatrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more naturalarrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edgeconnections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-artapproaches, while producing higher mesh quality.</description><author>Jeonghwan Kim, Yushi Lan, Armando Fortes, Yongwei Chen, Xingang Pan</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 01:23:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19188v2</guid></item><item><title>Cohort-Aware Agents for Individualized Lung Cancer Risk Prediction Using a Retrieval-Augmented Model Selection Framework</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14940v2</link><description>Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantialvariability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single modelperforms best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lungcancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriatemodel for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modernretrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structuredmetadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- theagent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity searchacross nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patientpopulation from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performancemetrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eightrepresentative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TD-VIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computervision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI).

Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and thenreconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preservingunedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generativemodels, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performsprecise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammerfirst predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents andkey-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editingphase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with thecorresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining thesecontextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction ofpreserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate theconsistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, ahuman-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefullylabeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammersignificantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency ofpreserved regions and overall quality.

We modify a powerful image-generator to create targetimages conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align themesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. Indetail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) thatdecouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. Weobserved that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulationoptimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences betweeninput and target images.

Furthermore, all components ofAUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantialspeedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS2018 &amp; 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 &amp; 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prioruniversal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x fastertraining on 16-frame sequences.</description><author>Miran Heo, Sukjun Hwang, Min-Hung Chen, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Albert Gu, Seon Joo Kim, Ryo Hachiuma</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:59:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19242v1</guid></item><item><title>Model Context Protocols in Adaptive Transport Systems: A Survey</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19239v1</link><description>The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AIapplications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated.

Cognitive sciencesuggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-livedrepresentations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preservesverbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-termmemory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, aCognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. Apretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokensthat form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank storeslow-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memoryretrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them withcurrent tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using thesetokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally awareaction sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasksacross three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, itachieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperformingstate-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain onBridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizontemporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizontasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline.

Temporal processing, an extensively researchedtopic, is one such example that lacks a coherent understanding of itsunderlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigate temporal processing in aDeep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent performing an interval timing task andexplore potential biological counterparts to its emergent behavior. The agentwas successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involvedmarking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a videosequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neuralactivations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, theagent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting theseoscillations with high amplitudes and frequencies corresponding to the targetinterval. Parallels are drawn between the agent's time-keeping strategy and theStriatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model, a biologically plausible model of intervaltiming. Furthermore, the agent maintained its oscillatory representations andtask performance when tested on different video sequences (including a blankvideo). Thus, once learned, the agent internalized its time-keeping mechanismand showed minimal reliance on its environment to perform the timing task. Ahypothesis about the resemblance between this emergent behavior and certainaspects of the evolution of biological processes like circadian rhythms, hasbeen discussed.

To address theselimitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigmin which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our frameworkleverages structured interface-specific representations and iterativerefinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematicevaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that comparesgenerative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, andemotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfacesconsistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them inover 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generativeinterfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.</description><author>Jiaqi Chen, Yanzhe Zhang, Yutong Zhang, Yijia Shao, Diyi Yang</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:43:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19227v1</guid></item><item><title>Evaluating the Evaluators: Are readability metrics good measures of readability?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19221v1</link><description>Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to distill complex documents intoaccessible summaries for non-expert audiences.

However, despite proven utility inother fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readabilityjudgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that mostcorrelate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL.We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, withthe best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with humanjudgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summariesaimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measuresof readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to differentconclusions than the traditional metrics.

However,collecting data from more identities is expensive, challenging, and oftenlimited by privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we propose INSIDE(Interpolating Speaker Identities in Embedding Space), a novel data expansionmethod that synthesizes new speaker identities by interpolating betweenexisting speaker embeddings. Specifically, we select pairs of nearby speakerembeddings from a pretrained speaker embedding space and compute intermediateembeddings using spherical linear interpolation. These interpolated embeddingsare then fed to a text-to-speech system to generate corresponding speechwaveforms. The resulting data is combined with the original dataset to traindownstream models. Experiments show that models trained with INSIDE-expandeddata outperform those trained only on real data, achieving 3.06\% to 5.24\%relative improvements. While INSIDE is primarily designed for speakerverification, we also validate its effectiveness on gender classification,where it yields a 13.44\% relative improvement. Moreover, INSIDE is compatiblewith other augmentation techniques and can serve as a flexible, scalableaddition to existing training pipelines.</description><author>Tianchi Liu, Ruijie Tao, Qiongqiong Wang, Yidi Jiang, Hardik B.

Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues likeaudio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, orcontext. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed togenerate character animations that are not only physically plausible but alsosemantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, isbuilt upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal LargeLanguage Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditionsthat provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motiongenerator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the productionof actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensurethe effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modalityconflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novelPseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model toaccurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, therebygenerating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, andlinguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achievesleading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-syncaccuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency withtextual prompts.

Thesepipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiencyand raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven modelidentification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of modeloutputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework thatuses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First(Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes anincoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow(modality -&gt; primary abnormality -&gt; model-card id). Checks are provided by (i)stagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) astagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at eachstage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflowwith clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM onspecialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstreamtasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifyingdeployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology,our single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines. Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approachshows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by datascientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection(with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead.</description><author>Shayan Vassef, Soorya Ram Shimegekar, Abhay Goyal, Koustuv Saha, Pi Zonooz, Navin Kumar</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:13:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16839v2</guid></item><item><title>Bridging the Editing Gap in LLMs: FineEdit for Precise and Targeted Text Modifications</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13358v3</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural languageprocessing, demonstrating strong capabilities in tasks such as text generation,summarization, and reasoning.

We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns thatillustrate how models learn to think with tools. Finally, we report improvedtool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turnswith ASPO. Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation forTIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why andhow they enable more powerful reasoning.</description><author>Heng Lin, Zhongwen Xu</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:03:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19201v1</guid></item><item><title>The Ramon Llull's Thinking Machine for Automated Ideation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19200v1</link><description>This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework forgenerating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptualfoundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for researchideation.

This paper introduces a method that automaticallygenerates task-specific, spatially adaptive dynamics models by learning whichregions of the object require high-resolution modeling to achieve good taskperformance for a given planning query. Task performance depends on the complexinterplay between the dynamics model, world dynamics, control, and taskrequirements. Our proposed diffusion-based model generator predicts per-regionmodel resolutions based on start and goal pointclouds that define the planningquery. To efficiently collect the data for learning this mapping, a two-stageprocess optimizes resolution using predictive dynamics as a prior beforedirectly optimizing using closed-loop performance. On a tree-manipulation task,our method doubles planning speed with only a small decrease in taskperformance over using a full-resolution model. This approach informs a pathtowards using previous planning and control data to generate computationallyefficient yet sufficiently expressive dynamics models for new tasks.</description><author>Alex LaGrassa, Zixuan Huang, Dmitry Berenson, Oliver Kroemer</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:03:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19199v1</guid></item><item><title>Investigating the Robustness of Extreme Precipitation Super-Resolution Across Climates</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09166v2</link><description>The coarse spatial resolution of gridded climate models, such as generalcirculation models, limits their direct use in projecting socially relevantvariables like extreme precipitation. Most downscaling methods estimate theconditional distributions of extremes by generating large ensembles,complicating the assessment of robustness under distributional shifts, such asthose induced by climate change. To better understand and potentially improverobustness, we propose super-resolving the parameters of the target variable'sprobability distribution directly using analytically tractable mappings. Withina perfect-model framework over Switzerland, we demonstrate that vectorgeneralized linear and additive models can super-resolve the generalizedextreme value distribution of summer hourly precipitation extremes from coarseprecipitation fields and topography. We introduce the notion of a "robustnessgap", defined as the difference in predictive error between present-trained andfuture-trained models, and use it to diagnose how model structure affects thegeneralization of each quantile to a pseudo-global warming scenario. Byevaluating multiple model configurations, we also identify an upper limit onthe super-resolution factor based on the spatial auto- and cross-correlation ofprecipitation and elevation, beyond which coarse precipitation loses predictivevalue. Our framework is broadly applicable to variables governed by parametricdistributions and offers a model-agnostic diagnostic for understanding when andwhy empirical downscaling generalizes to climate change and extremes.</description><author>Louise Largeau, Erwan Koch, David Leutwyler, Gregoire Mariethoz, Valerie Chavez-Demoulin, Tom Beucler</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:02:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09166v2</guid></item><item><title>Prompt-based Dynamic Token Pruning for Efficient Segmentation of Medical Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16369v2</link><description>The high computational demands of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in processing alarge number of tokens often constrain their practical application in analyzingmedical images. This research proposes a Prompt-driven Adaptive Token ({\itPrATo}) pruning method to selectively reduce the processing of irrelevanttokens in the segmentation pipeline. The prompt-based spatial prior helps torank the tokens according to their relevance. Tokens with low-relevance scoresare down-weighted, ensuring that only the relevant ones are propagated forprocessing across subsequent stages. This data-driven pruning strategy improvessegmentation accuracy and inference speed by allocating computational resourcesto essential regions. The proposed framework is integrated with severalstate-of-the-art models to facilitate the elimination of irrelevant tokens,thereby enhancing computational efficiency while preserving segmentationaccuracy. The experimental results show a reduction of $\sim$ 35-55% tokens;thus reducing the computational costs relative to baselines.

While humans intuitively grasp material characteristics such aselasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-sceneoptimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address thisproblem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neuralnetwork to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visualfeatures purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward networkcan perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with alearned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realisticphysics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we alsocollected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets andphysic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE isabout 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-timeoptimization methods.

However, progressively manipulating certainattributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remainschallenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider istrained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a newattribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancyaccumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practicalapplications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address thisissue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposesthe text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attributedirections. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enablinginterpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supportszero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) andthe composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate thatour method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achievingnotable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method canbe extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attributemanipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-worldscenarios.

Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitablyreuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as eachvertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively longtoken sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we proposean efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices andfaces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ anautoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token countto approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a singlestep by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacencymatrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more naturalarrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edgeconnections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-artapproaches, while producing higher mesh quality.</description><author>Jeonghwan Kim, Yushi Lan, Armando Fortes, Yongwei Chen, Xingang Pan</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 16:51:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19188v1</guid></item><item><title>Real-Time Model Checking for Closed-Loop Robot Reactive Planning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19186v1</link><description>We present a new application of model checking which achieves real-timemulti-step planning and obstacle avoidance on a real autonomous robot.

While existing methodsleverage multiple depth cues (e.g., estimating depth uncertainty, modelingdepth error) to improve depth accuracy, they overlook that accurate depthprediction requires conditioning on other 3D attributes, as these attributesare intrinsically inter-correlated through the 3D to 2D projection, whichultimately limits overall accuracy and stability. Inspired by Chain-of-Thought(CoT) in large language models (LLMs), this paper proposes MonoCoP, whichleverages a Chain-of-Prediction (CoP) to predict attributes sequentially andconditionally via three key designs. First, it employs a lightweightAttributeNet (AN) for each 3D attribute to learn attribute-specific features.Next, MonoCoP constructs an explicit chain to propagate these learned featuresfrom one attribute to the next. Finally, MonoCoP uses a residual connection toaggregate features for each attribute along the chain, ensuring that laterattribute predictions are conditioned on all previously processed attributeswithout forgetting the features of earlier ones. Experimental results show thatour MonoCoP achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on the KITTIleaderboard without requiring additional data and further surpasses existingmethods on the Waymo and nuScenes frontal datasets.</description><author>Zhihao Zhang, Abhinav Kumar, Girish Chandar Ganesan, Xiaoming Liu</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 16:31:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04594v5</guid></item><item><title>Image Coding for Machines via Feature-Preserving Rate-Distortion Optimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02216v2</link><description>Many images and videos are primarily processed by computer vision algorithms,involving only occasional human inspection. When this content requirescompression before processing, e.g., in distributed applications, codingmethods must optimize for both visual quality and downstream task performance.We first show theoretically that an approach to reduce the effect ofcompression for a given task loss is to perform rate-distortion optimization(RDO) using the distance between features, obtained from the original and thedecoded images, as a distortion metric. However, optimizing directly such arate-distortion objective is computationally impractical because it requiresiteratively encoding and decoding the entire image-plus feature evaluation-foreach possible coding configuration. We address this problem by simplifying theRDO formulation to make the distortion term computable using block-basedencoders. We first apply Taylor's expansion to the feature extractor, recastingthe feature distance as a quadratic metric involving the Jacobian matrix of theneural network. Then, we replace the linearized metric with a block-wiseapproximation, which we call input-dependent squared error (IDSE). To make themetric computable, we approximate IDSE using sketches of the Jacobian. Theresulting loss can be evaluated block-wise in the transform domain and combinedwith the sum of squared errors (SSE) to address both visual quality andcomputer vision performance. Simulations with AVC and HEVC across multiplefeature extractors and downstream networks show up to 17 % bit-rate savings forthe same task accuracy compared to RDO based on SSE, with no decoder complexityoverhead and a small (7.86 %) encoder complexity increase.</description><author>Samuel FernÃ¡ndez-MenduiÃ±a, Eduardo Pavez, Antonio Ortega</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 16:25:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02216v2</guid></item><item><title>Leveraging Evolutionary Surrogate-Assisted Prescription in Multi-Objective Chlorination Control Systems</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19173v1</link><description>This short, written report introduces the idea of EvolutionarySurrogate-Assisted Prescription (ESP) and presents preliminary results on itspotential use in training real-world agents as a part of the 1st AI forDrinking Water Chlorination Challenge at IJCAI-2025.

For example, simply equidistantmapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads tosevere performance degradation, even though the physical length remainsequivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trainedlanguage model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3Dperception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on textembeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between differentunits by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to furtherenhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features intogeometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are thenleveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluatethe proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on theMono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvementsover previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notableaccuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario.

This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTionfRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversationalevaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluationof clinical dialogue agents. MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinicalscenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived throughstructured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluatorfor detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expertclinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable ofproducing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism andbehavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preferencestudy. Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalablesafety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazarddetection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blindedassessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realismanalyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliablysimulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitativeevaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarkingfive LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenariosand 10 clinical domains. MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering withscalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-alignedsafety auditing.

However, automating this process with deep learning models ischallenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are oftenunavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is alabor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makesfew-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In thiswork, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with atopology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than morecomplex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-awareloss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizesstructural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. Toincrease our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a merethree annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improvesupon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection overUnion.

As thesemodels process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensorRAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edgedevices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation bydirectly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventionaltwo-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simpleadaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts theout-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post ToneProcessing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. Tocompensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradationpipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets forlarge-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensiveexperiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusionmethods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.</description><author>Yan Chen, Yi Wen, Wei Li, Junchao Liu, Yong Guo, Jie Hu, Xinghao Chen</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 16:06:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19154v1</guid></item><item><title>MicroMIL: Graph-Based Multiple Instance Learning for Context-Aware Diagnosis with Microscopic Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21604v4</link><description>Cancer diagnosis has greatly benefited from the integration of whole-slideimages (WSIs) with multiple instance learning (MIL), enabling high-resolutionanalysis of tissue morphology. Graph-based MIL (GNN-MIL) approaches haveemerged as powerful solutions for capturing contextual information in WSIs,thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. However, WSIs require significantcomputational and infrastructural resources, limiting accessibility inresource-constrained settings. Conventional light microscopes offer acost-effective alternative, but applying GNN-MIL to such data is challengingdue to extensive redundant images and missing spatial coordinates, which hindercontextual learning. To address these issues, we introduce MicroMIL, the firstweakly-supervised MIL framework specifically designed for images acquired fromconventional light microscopes. MicroMIL leverages a representative imageextractor (RIE) that employs deep cluster embedding (DCE) and hardGumbel-Softmax to dynamically reduce redundancy and select representativeimages. These images serve as graph nodes, with edges computed via cosinesimilarity, eliminating the need for spatial coordinates while preservingcontextual information. Extensive experiments on a real-world colon cancerdataset and the BreakHis dataset demonstrate that MicroMIL achievesstate-of-the-art performance, improving both diagnostic accuracy and robustnessto redundancy.

Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent'sdecisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such asbeliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making stylesemerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential butoften overlooked dimension of intelligence. This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observingand analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examinesits foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophicalperspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interactionloop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. Onthis basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurableindicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics. The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining andmeasuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretizedstate spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitivebalance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcementlearning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specificstylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like stylelearning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potentialof these techniques in domains such as game design and interactiveentertainment. Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role ofstyle as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).</description><author>Chiu-Chou Lin</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 16:04:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19152v1</guid></item><item><title>Generative Artificial Intelligence-Supported Pentesting: A Comparison between Claude Opus, GPT-4, and Copilot</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06963v2</link><description>The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has brought asignificant change to our society.

State-of-the-art generative models for 3D shape generation rely onthe denoising diffusion probabilistic models and manage to generate realisticnovel point clouds for 3D content creation and manipulation. Nevertheless, thegenerated 3D shapes lack associated point-wise semantic labels, restrictingtheir usage in enlarging the training data for point cloud segmentation tasks.To bridge the gap between data augmentation techniques and the advanceddiffusion models, we extend the state-of-the-art 3D diffusion model, Lion, to apart-aware generative model that can generate high-quality point cloudsconditioned on given segmentation masks. Leveraging the novel generative model,we introduce a 3-step generative data augmentation (GDA) pipeline for pointcloud segmentation training.

This paper introduces an ontology-driven Graph RAGframework designed to overcome these limitations. We ground our knowledge graphin a formal, LRMoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal Works fromtheir versioned Expressions. We model temporal states as efficient aggregationsthat reuse the versioned expressions (CTVs) of unchanged components, and wereify legislative events as first-class Action nodes to make causality explicitand queryable. This structured backbone enables a unified, planner-guided querystrategy that applies explicit policies to deterministically resolve complexrequests for (i) point-in-time retrieval, (ii) hierarchical impact analysis,and (iii) auditable provenance reconstruction. Through a case study on theBrazilian Constitution, we demonstrate how this approach provides a verifiable,temporally-correct substrate for LLMs, enabling higher-order analyticalcapabilities while drastically reducing the risk of factual errors. The resultis a practical framework for building more trustworthy and explainable legal AIsystems.</description><author>Hudson de Martim</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 15:27:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00039v4</guid></item></channel></rss>
