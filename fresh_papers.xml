Most existing methods requireend-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could becomputation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we rethink the RVOSproblem and aim to investigate the key to this task. Based on existingfoundation segmentation models, we decompose the RVOS task into referring,video, and segmentation factors, and propose a Temporal Prompt Generation andSelection (Tenet) framework to address the referring and video factors whileleaving the segmentation problem to foundation models. To efficiently adaptimage-based foundation segmentation models to referring video objectsegmentation, we leverage off-the-shelf object detectors and trackers toproduce temporal prompts associated with the referring sentence. Whilehigh-quality temporal prompts could be produced, they can not be easilyidentified from confidence scores. To tackle this issue, we propose PromptPreference Learning to evaluate the quality of the produced temporal prompts.By taking such prompts to instruct image-based foundation segmentation models,we would be able to produce high-quality masks for the referred object,enabling efficient model adaptation to referring video object segmentation.Experiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenetframework.</description><author>Ci-Siang Lin, Min-Hung Chen, I-Jieh Liu, Chien-Yi Wang, Sifei Liu, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:59:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07319v1</guid></item><item><title>Artificial Hippocampus Networks for Efficient Long-Context Modeling</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07318v1</link><description>Long-sequence modeling faces a fundamental trade-off between the efficiencyof compressive fixed-size memory in RNN-like models and the fidelity oflossless growing memory in attention-based Transformers. Inspired by theMulti-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework ofartificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of theTransformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable moduletermed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compressesout-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. Tovalidate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-likearchitectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and Gated DeltaNet. Extensiveexperiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstratethat AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines andachieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, whilesubstantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance,augmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5%and memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128ksequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88.

It has high potential to transform how visual signals areprocessed and interpreted with the help of quantum computing that leveragesquantum-mechanical effects in computations inaccessible to classical (i.e.non-quantum) computers. In scenarios where existing non-quantum methods cannotfind a solution in a reasonable time or compute only approximate solutions,quantum computers can provide, among others, advantages in terms of better timescalability for multiple problem classes. Parametrised quantum circuits canalso become, in the long term, a considerable alternative to classical neuralnetworks in computer vision. However, specialised and fundamentally newalgorithms must be developed to enable compatibility with quantum hardware andunveil the potential of quantum computational paradigms in computer vision.This survey contributes to the existing literature on QeCV with a holisticreview of this research field. It is designed as a quantum computing referencefor the computer vision community, targeting computer vision students,scientists and readers with related backgrounds who want to familiarisethemselves with QeCV. We provide a comprehensive introduction to QeCV, itsspecifics, and methodologies for formulations compatible with quantum hardwareand QeCV methods, leveraging two main quantum computational paradigms, i.e.gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing. We elaborate on theoperational principles of quantum computers and the available tools to access,program and simulate them in the context of QeCV. Finally, we review existingquantum computing tools and learning materials and discuss aspects related topublishing and reviewing QeCV papers, open challenges and potential socialimplications.</description><author>Natacha Kuete Meli, Shuteng Wang, Marcel Seelbach Benkner, Michele Sasdelli, Tat-Jun Chin, Tolga Birdal, Michael Moeller, Vladislav Golyanik</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:59:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07317v1</guid></item><item><title>NdLinear: Preserving Multi-Dimensional Structure for Parameter-Efficient Neural Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17353v3</link><description>In deep learning, processing multidimensional inputs (e.g., images, medicalscans, and time series) is an important task that often requires flattening theinputs. We introduce $\mathit{NdLinear}$, a drop-in replacement for linearlayers that operates directly on tensors, requiring no flattening. By applyingtransformations separately along each dimension, NdLinear preserves native datastructure while achieving dramatic parameter reductions, often by orders ofmagnitude, with minimal memory overhead. We prove NdLinear maintainsexpressivity through structured Tucker decomposition while preservingVC-dimension scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate NdLinear's capacity toachieve significant parameter reductions with substantial wall-clock efficiencygains and minimal memory overhead. For instance, our $\mathit{NdLinear-LoRA}$matches or exceeds standard LoRA on language reasoning tasks using up to$9\times$ fewer parameters. Experiments across CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, andMLPs on vision, language, time-series, and tabular tasks consistentlydemonstrate NdLinear's efficiency gains. While excelling at axis-separabletasks, NdLinear has limitations with entangled spatial interactions. Byprocessing data in its original N-dimensional form, NdLinear provides atheoretically grounded, practical component for building more efficient neuralarchitectures.</description><author>Alex Reneau, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Zhongfang Zhuang, Ting-Chun Liu, Xiang He, Judah Goldfeder, Nadav Timor, Allen G Roush, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:59:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17353v3</guid></item><item><title>Pixel-Perfect Depth with Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07316v1</link><description>This paper presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation modelbased on pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality,flying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps. Current generativedepth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressiveperformance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latentspace, which inevitably introduces \textit{flying pixels} at edges and details.Our model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generationin the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the highcomplexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two noveldesigns: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), whichincorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT toprompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistencywhile enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design thatprogressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency andaccuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all publishedgenerative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms allother models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.</description><author>Gangwei Xu, Haotong Lin, Hongcheng Luo, Xianqi Wang, Jingfeng Yao, Lianghui Zhu, Yuechuan Pu, Cheng Chi, Haiyang Sun, Bing Wang, Guang Chen, Hangjun Ye, Sida Peng, Xin Yang</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:59:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07316v1</guid></item><item><title>Vibe Checker: Aligning Code Evaluation with Human Preference</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07315v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed vibe coding, where users leverageLLMs to generate and iteratively refine code through natural languageinteractions until it passes their vibe check. Vibe check is tied to real-worldhuman preference and goes beyond functionality: the solution should feel right,read cleanly, preserve intent, and remain correct. However, current codeevaluation remains anchored to pass@k and captures only functional correctness,overlooking the non-functional instructions that users routinely apply. In thispaper, we hypothesize that instruction following is the missing pieceunderlying vibe check that represents human preference in coding besidesfunctional correctness. To quantify models' code instruction followingcapabilities with measurable signals, we present VeriCode, a taxonomy of 30verifiable code instructions together with corresponding deterministicverifiers. We use the taxonomy to augment established evaluation suites,resulting in Vibe Checker, a testbed to assess both code instruction followingand functional correctness. Upon evaluating 31 leading LLMs, we show that eventhe strongest models struggle to comply with multiple instructions and exhibitclear functional regression. Most importantly, a composite score of functionalcorrectness and instruction following correlates the best with humanpreference, with the latter emerging as the primary differentiator onreal-world programming tasks. Our work identifies core factors of the vibecheck, providing a concrete path for benchmarking and developing models thatbetter align with user preferences in coding.</description><author>Ming Zhong, Xiang Zhou, Ting-Yun Chang, Qingze Wang, Nan Xu, Xiance Si, Dan Garrette, Shyam Upadhyay, Jeremiah Liu, Jiawei Han, Benoit Schillings, Jiao Sun</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:59:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07315v1</guid></item><item><title>GyroSwin: 5D Surrogates for Gyrokinetic Plasma Turbulence Simulations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07314v1</link><description>Nuclear fusion plays a pivotal role in the quest for reliable and sustainableenergy production. A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understandingplasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vitalfor next-generation reactor design. Plasma turbulence is governed by thenonlinear gyrokinetic equation, which evolves a 5D distribution function overtime. Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are oftenemployed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However,they omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, weintroduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5Dnonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomenaneglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulentheat transport.GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D,(ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent3D$\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields andthe distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separationinspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widelyused reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energycascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by threeorders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable. GyroSwin showspromising scaling laws, tested up to one billion parameters, paving the way forscalable neural surrogates for gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence.</description><author>Fabian Paischer, Gianluca Galletti, William Hornsby, Paul Setinek, Lorenzo Zanisi, Naomi Carey, Stanislas Pamela, Johannes Brandstetter</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:59:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07314v1</guid></item><item><title>WristWorld: Generating Wrist-Views via 4D World Models for Robotic Manipulation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07313v1</link><description>Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capturefine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulationperformance. Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resultingin a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views.Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-viewfirst frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor viewsalone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge withgeometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extremeviewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views.WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT andincorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimategeometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation,which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherentwrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid,Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation withsuperior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising theaverage task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of theanchor-wrist view gap.</description><author>Zezhong Qian, Xiaowei Chi, Yuming Li, Shizun Wang, Zhiyuan Qin, Xiaozhu Ju, Sirui Han, Shanghang Zhang</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:59:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07313v1</guid></item><item><title>h1: Bootstrapping LLMs to Reason over Longer Horizons via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07312v1</link><description>Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performancedrops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat thisrely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither ofwhich scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstraplong-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizondata. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex,multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this datausing outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases incomplexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating.Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training oncomposed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer,competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x.Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher thanbaselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoningpaths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewardsachieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizontraining, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizonproblems using only existing data.</description><author>Sumeet Ramesh Motwani, Alesia Ivanova, Ziyang Cai, Philip Torr, Riashat Islam, Shital Shah, Christian Schroeder de Witt, Charles London</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:58:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07312v1</guid></item><item><title>DESIGNER: Design-Logic-Guided Multidisciplinary Data Synthesis for LLM Reasoning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12726v3</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many naturallanguage tasks but still struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning,particularly across diverse disciplines. Existing reasoning datasets often lackdisciplinary breadth, reasoning depth, and diversity, and lack guidingprinciples for question synthesis. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEdReasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensiveraw documents (e.g., book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinarychallenging questions. We introduce the concept of "design logic" and instructLLMs to mimic human educators' question-creation process, enabling automatedsynthesis of large-scale, high-difficulty questions. We use LLMs toreverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design logics from existingquestions across various disciplines. By matching these design logics withsource documents, we are able to create reasoning questions that far surpassthe difficulty and diversity of existing datasets. Using this pipeline, wesynthesized two large-scale reasoning datasets that span 75 disciplines:DLR-Book (3.04 million questions from the book corpus) and DLR-Web (1.66million questions from the web corpus). Data analysis indicates that thequestions synthesized by our method exhibit greater difficulty and diversitycompared to those in the baseline datasets. We validate our synthesized datathrough supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the Qwen3 and Llama3 model families.Our data substantially enhances their multidisciplinary reasoning capabilities,outperforming existing datasets. Notably, after SFT on our datasets, the baseversions of these models even surpass their official instruction-tunedcounterparts.</description><author>Weize Liu, Yongchi Zhao, Yijia Luo, Mingyu Xu, Jiaheng Liu, Yanan Li, Xiguo Hu, Zhiqi Bai, Yuchi Xu, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:57:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12726v3</guid></item><item><title>MATRIX: Mask Track Alignment for Interaction-aware Video Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07310v1</link><description>Video DiTs have advanced video generation, yet they still struggle to modelmulti-instance or subject-object interactions. This raises a key question: Howdo these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curateMATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instancemask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis thatformalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, viavideo-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens captureinstances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-videoattention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. Wefind both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers.Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularizationthat aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance masktracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation.We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-awarevideo generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity andsemantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablationsvalidate our design choices.

Weintroduce CORGI, a new benchmark specifically designed for real-world businesscontexts. CORGI is composed of synthetic databases inspired by enterprises suchas Doordash, Airbnb, and Lululemon. It provides questions across fourincreasingly complex categories of business queries: descriptive, explanatory,predictive, and recommendational. This challenge calls for causal reasoning,temporal forecasting, and strategic recommendation, reflecting multi-level andmulti-step agentic intelligence. We find that LLM performance drops onhigh-level questions, struggling to make accurate predictions and offeractionable plans. Based on execution success rate, the CORGI benchmark is about21\% more difficult than the BIRD benchmark. This highlights the gap betweenpopular LLMs and the need for real-world business intelligence.

Current MLE benchmarks suffer fromlow scalability and limited applicability because they rely on static, manuallycurated tasks, demanding extensive time and manual effort to produce. Weintroduce MLE-Smith, a fully automated multi-agent pipeline, to transform rawdatasets into competition-style MLE challenges through an efficientgenerate-verify-execute paradigm for scaling MLE tasks with verifiable quality,real-world usability, and rich diversity. The proposed multi-agent pipeline inMLE-Smith drives structured task design and standardized refactoring, coupledwith a hybrid verification mechanism that enforces strict structural rules andhigh-level semantic soundness. It further validates empirical solvability andreal-world fidelity through interactive execution. We apply MLE-Smith to 224 ofreal-world datasets and generate 606 tasks spanning multiple categories,objectives, and modalities, demonstrating that MLE-Smith can work effectivelyacross a wide range of real-world datasets. Evaluation on the generated tasksshows that the performance of eight mainstream and cutting-edge LLMs onMLE-Smith tasks is strongly correlated with their performance on carefullyhuman-designed tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the MLE-Smith toscaling up MLE tasks, while maintaining task quality.</description><author>Rushi Qiang, Yuchen Zhuang, Anikait Singh, Percy Liang, Chao Zhang, Sherry Yang, Bo Dai</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:57:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07307v1</guid></item><item><title>Cocoon: A System Architecture for Differentially Private Training with Correlated Noises</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07304v1</link><description>Machine learning (ML) models memorize and leak training data, causing seriousprivacy issues to data owners. Training algorithms with differential privacy(DP), such as DP-SGD, have been gaining attention as a solution. However,DP-SGD adds a noise at each training iteration, which degrades the accuracy ofthe trained model. To improve accuracy, a new family of approaches addscarefully designed correlated noises, so that noises cancel out each otheracross iterations. We performed an extensive characterization study of thesenew mechanisms, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, and show theyincur non-negligible overheads when the model is large or uses large embeddingtables. Motivated by the analysis, we propose Cocoon, a hardware-softwareco-designed framework for efficient training with correlated noises. Cocoonaccelerates models with embedding tables through pre-computing and storingcorrelated noises in a coalesced format (Cocoon-Emb), and supports large modelsthrough a custom near-memory processing device (Cocoon-NMP). On a real systemwith an FPGA-based NMP device prototype, Cocoon improves the performance by2.33-10.82x(Cocoon-Emb) and 1.55-3.06x (Cocoon-NMP).</description><author>Donghwan Kim, Xin Gu, Jinho Baek, Timothy Lo, Younghoon Min, Kwangsik Shin, Jongryool Kim, Jongse Park, Kiwan Maeng</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:56:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07304v1</guid></item><item><title>SpecGuard: Spectral Projection-based Advanced Invisible Watermarking</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07302v1</link><description>Watermarking embeds imperceptible patterns into images for authenticityverification. However, existing methods often lack robustness against varioustransformations primarily including distortions, image regeneration, andadversarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, weintroduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking approach for robust and invisibleimage watermarking. Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hiddenconvolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequencydomain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposedby wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transformapproximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently.In the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverseattacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions,ensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoderleverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermarkpattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. Weevaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility,capacity, and robustness.

However, current LRMs exhibit two criticallimitations when processing non-English languages: (1) They often struggle tomaintain input-output language consistency; (2) They generally perform poorlywith wrong reasoning paths and lower answer accuracy compared to English. Theselimitations significantly degrade the user experience for non-English speakersand hinder the global deployment of LRMs. To address these limitations, wepropose M-Thinker, which is trained by the GRPO algorithm that involves aLanguage Consistency (LC) reward and a novel Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment(CTA) reward. Specifically, the LC reward defines a strict constraint on thelanguage consistency between the input, thought, and answer. Besides, the CTAreward compares the model's non-English reasoning paths with its Englishreasoning path to transfer its own reasoning capability from English tonon-English languages. Through an iterative RL procedure, our M-Thinker-1.5B/7Bmodels not only achieve nearly 100% language consistency and superiorperformance on two multilingual benchmarks (MMATH and PolyMath), but alsoexhibit excellent generalization on out-of-domain languages.</description><author>Xue Zhang, Yunlong Liang, Fandong Meng, Songming Zhang, Kaiyu Huang, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu, Jie Zhou</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:55:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07300v1</guid></item><item><title>LatteReview: A Multi-Agent Framework for Systematic Review Automation Using Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05468v2</link><description>Systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses are essential forsynthesizing research insights, but they remain time-intensive andlabor-intensive due to the iterative processes of screening, evaluation, anddata extraction.

These models struggle with the quadratic cost of attention($O(N^2)$) and with modeling long-range temporal dependencies. Existing audiobenchmarks are built mostly from short clips and do not evaluate models inrealistic long context settings. To address this gap, we introduceAudioMarathon, a benchmark designed to evaluate both understanding andinference efficiency on long-form audio. AudioMarathon provides a diverse setof tasks built upon three pillars: long-context audio inputs with durationsranging from 90.0 to 300.0 seconds, which correspond to encoded sequences of2,250 to 7,500 audio tokens, respectively, full domain coverage across speech,sound, and music, and complex reasoning that requires multi-hop inference. Weevaluate state-of-the-art LALMs and observe clear performance drops as audiolength grows. We also study acceleration techniques and analyze the trade-offsof token pruning and KV cache eviction. The results show large gaps acrosscurrent LALMs and highlight the need for better temporal reasoning andmemory-efficient architectures. We believe AudioMarathon will drive the audioand multimodal research community to develop more advanced audio understandingmodels capable of solving complex audio tasks.</description><author>Peize He, Zichen Wen, Yubo Wang, Yuxuan Wang, Xiaoqian Liu, Jiajie Huang, Zehui Lei, Zhuangcheng Gu, Xiangqi Jin, Jiabing Yang, Kai Li, Zhifei Liu, Weijia Li, Cunxiang Wang, Conghui He, Linfeng Zhang</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:50:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07293v1</guid></item><item><title>Dyna-Think: Synergizing Reasoning, Acting, and World Model Simulation in AI Agents</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00320v2</link><description>Recent progress in reasoning with large language models (LLMs), such asDeepSeek-R1, demonstrates impressive capabilities in domains like mathematicsand coding, by exhibiting complex cognitive behaviors such as verification,goal decomposition, and self-reflection. However, it is unclear what behavioris effective and what behavior is missing for long-horizon AI agents tasks. Inthis work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planningwith an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agentperformance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning(DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy withDyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performingworld model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, andtrains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDTuses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modelingability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, andthen improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods onOSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves theagent's in-domain and out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-nperformance compared to R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average. Ourextensive empirical studies reveal that 1) using critique generation for worldmodel training is effective to improve policy performance; and 2) AI agentswith better performance correlate with better world modeling abilities. Webelieve our results suggest a promising research direction to integrate worldmodel simulation into AI agents to enhance their reasoning, planning, andacting capabilities.</description><author>Xiao Yu, Baolin Peng, Ruize Xu, Michel Galley, Hao Cheng, Suman Nath, Jianfeng Gao, Zhou Yu</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:49:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00320v2</guid></item><item><title>BLISS: A Lightweight Bilevel Influence Scoring Method for Data Selection in Language Model Pretraining</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06048v2</link><description>Effective data selection is essential for pretraining large language models(LLMs), enhancing efficiency and improving generalization to downstream tasks.However, existing approaches often require leveraging external pretrainedmodels, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of data selection fromthose of the external pretrained models. In addition, they often overlook thelong-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence,primarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining. In thispaper, we introduce BLISS (\textbf{B}ileve\textbf{L} \textbf{I}nfluence\textbf{S}coring method for data \textbf{S}election): a lightweight dataselection method that operates entirely \emph{from scratch}, without relying onany external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for thelong-term impact of selected data. BLISS leverages a small proxy model as asurrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-terminfluence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence. Weformulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where theupper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights totraining samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e.,training the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence)leads to best validation performance. Once optimized, the trained score modelpredicts influence scores for the dataset, enabling efficient selection ofhigh-quality samples for LLM pretraining. We validate BLISS by pretraining410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B models on selected subsets of the C4dataset. Notably, under the 1B model setting, BLISS achieves $1.7\times$speedup in reaching the same performance as the state-of-the-art method,demonstrating superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.</description><author>Jie Hao, Rui Yu, Wei Zhang, Huixia Wang, Jie Xu, Mingrui Liu</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:49:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06048v2</guid></item><item><title>SafeProtein: Red-Teaming Framework and Benchmark for Protein Foundation Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03487v2</link><description>Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes.

When instructionsprovide only a general and abstract goal without specific details aboutpotential issues in the response, LLMs must rely on their internal knowledge toimprove response quality, a process referred to as intrinsic self-correction.The empirical success of intrinsic self-correction is evident in variousapplications, but how and why it is effective remains unknown. Focusing onmoral self-correction in LLMs, we reveal a key characteristic of intrinsicself-correction: performance convergence through multi-round interactions; andprovide a mechanistic analysis of this convergence behavior. Based on ourexperimental results and analysis, we uncover the underlying mechanism ofconvergence: consistently injected self-correction instructions activate moralconcepts that reduce model uncertainty, leading to converged performance as theactivated moral concepts stabilize over successive rounds.

While pre-trained 2D graph encoders have demonstratedstrong performance, they overlook the rich molecular domain knowledgeassociated with submolecular instances (atoms and bonds). While molecularpre-training approaches incorporate such knowledge into their pre-trainingobjectives, they typically employ designs tailored to a specific type ofknowledge, lacking the flexibility to integrate diverse knowledge present inmolecules. Hence, reusing widely available and well-validated pre-trained 2Dencoders, while incorporating molecular domain knowledge during downstreamadaptation, offers a more practical alternative. In this work, we proposeMolGA, which adapts pre-trained 2D graph encoders to downstream molecularapplications by flexibly incorporating diverse molecular domain knowledge.First, we propose a molecular alignment strategy that bridge the gap betweenpre-trained topological representations with domain-knowledge representations.Second, we introduce a conditional adaptation mechanism that generatesinstance-specific tokens to enable fine-grained integration of molecular domainknowledge for downstream tasks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments oneleven public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MolGA.</description><author>Xingtong Yu, Chang Zhou, Xinming Zhang, Yuan Fang</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:46:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07289v1</guid></item><item><title>Evolutionary Profiles for Protein Fitness Prediction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07286v1</link><description>Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineeringbut constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space.Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM)exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view byinterpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM asinverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expertdemonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topologicalstructures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient incapturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integratesboth while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. Thispaper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated TemporalConvolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome theselimitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extractinghierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph ConvolutionalNetwork (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The coreinnovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism,implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preservesoriginal feature information through residual connections, which is criticalfor mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivityfor rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensiveexperiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, tovalidate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposedGTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperformingexisting baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.</description><author>Tianxiang Xu, Zhichao Wen, Xinyu Zhao, Qi Hu, Yan Li, Chang Liu</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:45:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07285v1</guid></item><item><title>Online Rubrics Elicitation from Pairwise Comparisons</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07284v1</link><description>Rubrics provide a flexible way to train LLMs on open-ended long-form answerswhere verifiable rewards are not applicable and human preferences providecoarse signals.

Suchstatic rubrics, however, are vulnerable to reward-hacking type behaviors andfail to capture emergent desiderata that arise during training. We introduceOnline Rubrics Elicitation (OnlineRubrics), a method that dynamically curatesevaluation criteria in an online manner through pairwise comparisons ofresponses from current and reference policies. This online process enablescontinuous identification and mitigation of errors as training proceeds.Empirically, this approach yields consistent improvements of up to 8% overtraining exclusively with static rubrics across AlpacaEval, GPQA, ArenaHard aswell as the validation sets of expert questions and rubrics.

This enables high utility training with small, domain-specificdatasets typical in sensitive applications. Membership inference attacks (MIAs)provide an empirical estimate of the privacy leakage by machine learningmodels. Yet, prior assessments of MIAs against models fine-tuned with transferlearning rely on a small subset of possible attacks. We address this bycomparing performance of diverse MIAs in transfer learning settings to helppractitioners identify the most efficient attacks for privacy risk evaluation.We find that attack efficacy decreases with the increase in training data forscore-based MIAs. We find that there is no one MIA which captures all privacyrisks in models trained with transfer learning.

While deep learning has shown promising resultsfor automatically detecting this condition from fundus images, its applicationremains challenging due the limited availability of annotated data. FoundationModels (FM) have emerged as an alternative solution. However, it is unclear ifthey can cope with DME detection in particular. In this paper, wesystematically compare different FM and standard transfer learning approachesfor this task. Specifically, we compare the two most popular FM for retinalimages--RETFound and FLAIR--and an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, across differenttraining regimes and evaluation settings in IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 andOCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images (OEFI). Results show that despite their scale, FM donot consistently outperform fine-tuned CNNs in this task. In particular, anEfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in terms of area under the ROC andprecision/recall curves in most evaluation settings, with RETFound only showingpromising results in OEFI. FLAIR, on the other hand, demonstrated competitivezero-shot performance, achieving notable AUC-PR scores when promptedappropriately.

Current multi-objective multi-agent path finding(MO-MAPF) algorithms typically produce conflict-free plans by computing Paretofrontiers. They do not explicitly optimize for user-defined preferences, evenwhen the preferences are available, and scale poorly with the number ofobjectives. We propose a lexicographic framework for modeling MO-MAPF, alongwith an algorithm \textit{Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search} (LCBS) thatdirectly computes a single solution aligned with a lexicographic preferenceover objectives. LCBS integrates a priority-aware low-level $A^*$ search withconflict-based search, avoiding Pareto frontier construction and enablingefficient planning guided by preference over objectives. We provide insightsinto optimality and scalability, and empirically demonstrate that LCBS computesoptimal solutions while scaling to instances with up to ten objectives -- farbeyond the limits of existing MO-MAPF methods. Evaluations on standard andrandomized MAPF benchmarks show consistently higher success rates againststate-of-the-art baselines, especially with increasing number of objectives.</description><author>Pulkit Rustagi, Kyle Hollins Wray, Sandhya Saisubramanian</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:40:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07276v1</guid></item><item><title>Dual Natural Gradient Descent for Scalable Training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21404v2</link><description>Natural-gradient methods markedly accelerate the training of Physics-InformedNeural Networks (PINNs), yet their Gauss--Newton update must be solved in theparameter space, incurring a prohibitive $O(n^3)$ time complexity, where $n$ isthe number of network trainable weights.

The goal in this recently introducedproblem is for a learner to generate a sequence of predictions which arebroadcast to a collection of downstream decision makers. Each decision makerhas their own utility function, as well as a vector of constraint functions,each mapping their actions and an adversarially selected state to reward orconstraint violation terms. The downstream decision makers select actions "asif" the state predictions are correct, and the goal of the learner is toproduce predictions such that all downstream decision makers choose actionsthat give them worst-case utility guarantees while minimizing worst-caseconstraint violation. Within this framework, we give the first algorithm thatobtains simultaneous \emph{dynamic regret} guarantees for all of the agents --where regret for each agent is measured against a potentially changing sequenceof actions across rounds of interaction, while also ensuring vanishingconstraint violation for each agent. Our results do not require the agentsthemselves to maintain any state -- they only solve one-round constrainedoptimization problems defined by the prediction made at that round.</description><author>Yahav Bechavod, Jiuyao Lu, Aaron Roth</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:28:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07266v1</guid></item><item><title>LLMVA-GEBC: Large Language Model with Video Adapter for Generic Event Boundary Captioning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10354v2</link><description>Our winning entry for the CVPR 2023 Generic Event Boundary Captioning (GEBC)competition is detailed in this paper.

Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, anotable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers theeffective training of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs).Additionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-videosummarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video contentsummarization. Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal tomultimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasksbased on the summary's modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), anda combination of video and text summarization (V2VT). However, the textualsummaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate. To address theseissues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization datasetfeaturing 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39%. Each videosummary in Instruct-V2Xum is paired with a textual summary that referencesspecific frame indexes, facilitating the generation of aligned video andtextual summaries. In addition, we propose a new video summarization frameworknamed V2Xum-LLM. V2Xum-LLM, specifically V2Xum-LLaMA in this study, is thefirst framework that unifies different video summarization tasks into one largelanguage model's (LLM) text decoder and achieves task-controllable videosummarization with temporal prompts and task instructions. Experiments showthat V2Xum-LLaMA outperforms strong baseline models on multiple videosummarization tasks. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced evaluation metric forV2V and V2VT summarization tasks.</description><author>Hang Hua, Yolo Yunlong Tang, Chenliang Xu, Jiebo Luo</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:22:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12353v3</guid></item><item><title>Test-Time Graph Search for Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07257v1</link><description>Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) trains policies thatreach user-specified goals at test time, providing a simple, unsupervised,domain-agnostic way to extract diverse behaviors from unlabeled, reward-freedatasets. Nonetheless, long-horizon decision making remains difficult for GCRLagents due to temporal credit assignment and error accumulation, and theoffline setting amplifies these effects. To alleviate this issue, we introduceTest-Time Graph Search (TTGS), a lightweight planning approach to solve theGCRL task. TTGS accepts any state-space distance or cost signal, builds aweighted graph over dataset states, and performs fast search to assemble asequence of subgoals that a frozen policy executes. When the base learner isvalue-based, the distance is derived directly from the learned goal-conditionedvalue function, so no handcrafted metric is needed. TTGS requires no changes totraining, no additional supervision, no online interaction, and no privilegedinformation, and it runs entirely at inference. On the OGBench benchmark, TTGSimproves success rates of multiple base learners on challenging locomotiontasks, demonstrating the benefit of simple metric-guided test-time planning foroffline GCRL.</description><author>Evgenii Opryshko, Junwei Quan, Claas Voelcker, Yilun Du, Igor Gilitschenski</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:20:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07257v1</guid></item><item><title>Empowering LLMs with Pseudo-Untrimmed Videos for Audio-Visual Temporal Understanding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16276v3</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities innatural language and multimodal domains. By fine-tuning multimodal LLMs withtemporal annotations from well-annotated datasets, e.g., dense video captioningdatasets, their temporal understanding capacity in video-language tasks can beobtained. However, there is a notable lack of untrimmed audio-visual videodatasets with precise temporal annotations for events. This deficiency hindersLLMs from learning the alignment between time, audio-visual events, and texttokens, thus impairing their ability to temporally localize audio-visual eventsin videos. To address this gap, we introduce PU-VALOR, a comprehensiveaudio-visual dataset comprising over 114,000 pseudo-untrimmed videos withdetailed temporal annotations. PU-VALOR is derived from the large-scale butcoarse-annotated audio-visual dataset VALOR, through a subtle method involvingevent-based video clustering, random temporal scaling, and permutation. Byfine-tuning a multimodal LLM on PU-VALOR, we developed AVicuna, a model capableof aligning audio-visual events with temporal intervals and corresponding texttokens. AVicuna excels in temporal localization and time-aware dialoguecapabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that AVicuna effectively handlestemporal understanding in audio-visual videos and achieves state-of-the-artperformance on open-ended video QA, audio-visual QA, and audio-visual eventdense localization tasks.</description><author>Yolo Yunlong Tang, Daiki Shimada, Jing Bi, Mingqian Feng, Hang Hua, Chenliang Xu</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:18:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16276v3</guid></item><item><title>Efficient reductions from a Gaussian source with applications to statistical-computational tradeoffs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07250v1</link><description>Given a single observation from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean$\theta$, we design computationally efficient procedures that can approximatelygenerate an observation from a different target distribution $Q_{\theta}$uniformly for all $\theta$ in a parameter set. We leverage our technique toestablish reduction-based computational lower bounds for several canonicalhigh-dimensional statistical models under widely-believed conjectures inaverage-case complexity. In particular, we cover cases in which: 1. $Q_{\theta}$ is a general location model with non-Gaussian distribution,including both light-tailed examples (e.g., generalized normal distributions)and heavy-tailed ones (e.g., Student's $t$-distributions). As a consequence, weshow that computational lower bounds proved for spiked tensor PCA with Gaussiannoise are universal, in that they extend to other non-Gaussian noisedistributions within our class. 2. $Q_{\theta}$ is a normal distribution with mean $f(\theta)$ for a general,smooth, and nonlinear link function $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.Using this reduction, we construct a reduction from symmetric mixtures oflinear regressions to generalized linear models with link function $f$, andestablish computational lower bounds for solving the $k$-sparse generalizedlinear model when $f$ is an even function. This result constitutes the firstreduction-based confirmation of a $k$-to-$k^2$ statistical-to-computational gapin $k$-sparse phase retrieval, resolving a conjecture posed by Cai et al.(2016).

A commonfailure mode is schema misalignment: models hallucinate plausible butnon-existent tool names that reflect naming conventions internalized duringpretraining but absent from the provided tool schema. Rather than forcingmodels to adapt to arbitrary schemas, we propose adapting schemas to align withmodels' pretrained knowledge. We introduce PA-Tool (Pretraining-Aligned ToolSchema Generation), a training-free method that leverages peakedness-a signalfrom contamination detection indicating pretraining familiarity-toautomatically rename tool components. By generating multiple candidates andselecting those with highest output concentration across samples, PA-Toolidentifies pretrain-aligned naming patterns. Experiments on MetaTool andRoTBench show improvements of up to 17% points, with schema misalignment errorsreduced by 80%. PA-Tool enables small models to approach state-of-the-artperformance while maintaining computational efficiency for adaptation to newtools without retraining.

Among these top-downinfluences, language plays a crucial role in guiding attention by shaping howvisual information is interpreted. Existing methods primarily focus on modelingperceptual information while neglecting the reasoning process facilitated bylanguage, where ranking cues are crucial outcomes of this process and practicalguidance for saliency prediction. In this paper, we propose CaRDiff (Caption,Rank, and generate with Diffusion), a framework that imitates the process byintegrating a multimodal large language model (MLLM), a grounding module, and adiffusion model, to enhance video saliency prediction. Specifically, weintroduce a novel prompting method VSOR-CoT (Video Salient Object Ranking Chainof Thought), which utilizes an MLLM with a grounding module to caption videocontent and infer salient objects along with their rankings and positions. Thisprocess derives ranking maps that can be sufficiently leveraged by thediffusion model to decode the saliency maps for the given video accurately.Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of VSOR-CoT in improving theperformance of video saliency prediction.

The unprecedented coverage of the Earth's surfaceand atmosphere by satellite imagery has resulted in large volumes of data thatmust be transmitted to ground stations, stored in data centers, and distributedto end users. Modern Earth System Models (ESMs) face similar challenges,operating at high spatial and temporal resolutions, producing petabytes of dataper simulated day. Data compression has gained relevance over the past decade,with neural compression (NC) emerging from deep learning and informationtheory, making EO data and ESM outputs ideal candidates due to their abundanceof unlabeled data. In this review, we outline recent developments in NC appliedto geospatial data. We introduce the fundamental concepts of NC includingseminal works in its traditional applications to image and video compressiondomains with focus on lossy compression. We discuss the unique characteristicsof EO and ESM data, contrasting them with "natural images", and explain theadditional challenges and opportunities they present. Moreover, we reviewcurrent applications of NC across various EO modalities and explore the limitedefforts in ESM compression to date. The advent of self-supervised learning(SSL) and foundation models (FM) has advanced methods to efficiently distillrepresentations from vast unlabeled data. We connect these developments to NCfor EO, highlighting the similarities between the two fields and elaborate onthe potential of transferring compressed feature representations formachine--to--machine communication.

Traditionalsupervised detection methods depend on large, curated datasets for training andoften fail to generalize to novel, out-of-domain image generators. As analternative, we explore pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shotdetection of AI-generated images. We evaluate VLM performance on three diversebenchmarks encompassing synthetic images of human faces, objects, and animalsproduced by 16 different state-of-the-art image generators. While off-the-shelfVLMs perform poorly on these datasets, we find that their reasoning can beguided effectively through simple response prefilling -- a method we callPrefill-Guided Thinking (PGT). In particular, prefilling a VLM response withthe task-aligned phrase "Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts"improves the Macro F1 scores of three widely used open-source VLMs by up to24%.</description><author>Zoher Kachwala, Danishjeet Singh, Danielle Yang, Filippo Menczer</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:59:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11031v3</guid></item><item><title>MMPerspective: Do MLLMs Understand Perspective?

We introduce MMPerspective, the firstbenchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' understandingof perspective through 10 carefully crafted tasks across three complementarydimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. Our benchmarkcomprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing pointperception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationshipunderstanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preservingtransformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-artMLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competenceon surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoningand maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis furtherreveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspectivecapabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits ofchain-of-thought prompting.

In this paper, we present thefirst large-scale characterization of MGT on Reddit. Using a state-of-the-artstatistical method for detection of MGT, we analyze over two years of activity(2022-2024) across 51 subreddits representative of Reddit's main communitytypes such as information seeking, social support, and discussion. We study theconcentration of MGT across communities and over time, and compared MGT tohuman-authored text in terms of social signals it expresses and engagement itreceives. Our very conservative estimate of MGT prevalence indicates thatsynthetic text is marginally present on Reddit, but it can reach peaks of up to9% in some communities in some months. MGT is unevenly distributed acrosscommunities, more prevalent in subreddits focused on technical knowledge andsocial support, and often concentrated in the activity of a small fraction ofusers. MGT also conveys distinct social signals of warmth and status givingtypical of language of AI assistants. Despite these stylistic differences, MGTachieves engagement levels comparable than human-authored content and in a fewcases even higher, suggesting that AI-generated text is becoming an organiccomponent of online social discourse. This work offers the first perspective onthe MGT footprint on Reddit, paving the way for new investigations involvingplatform governance, detection strategies, and community dynamics.</description><author>Lucio La Cava, Luca Maria Aiello, Andrea Tagarelli</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:57:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07226v1</guid></item><item><title>KnowRL: Exploring Knowledgeable Reinforcement Learning for Factuality</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19807v3</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, oftenexhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inabilityto accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning.

Prior research hasshown that LLMs often fail to perform satisfactorily on tasks requiring moralcognizance, such as ethics-based judgments. While current approaches havefocused on fine-tuning LLMs with curated datasets to improve their capabilitieson such tasks, choosing the optimal learning paradigm to enhance the ethicalresponses of LLMs remains an open research debate. In this work, we aim toaddress this fundamental question: can current learning paradigms enable LLMsto acquire sufficient moral reasoning capabilities? Drawing from distributionalsemantics theory and the pragmatic nature of moral discourse, our analysisindicates that performance improvements follow a mechanism similar to that ofsemantic-level tasks, and therefore remain affected by the pragmatic nature ofmorals latent in discourse, a phenomenon we name the pragmatic dilemma.

While recent advances in large multilingual models like OpenAI'sWhisper offer promising pathways for low-resource ASR development, criticalquestions persist regarding practical deployment requirements. This paperaddresses two fundamental concerns for practitioners: determining the minimumdata volumes needed for viable performance and characterizing the primaryfailure modes that emerge in production systems. We evaluate Whisper'sperformance through comprehensive experiments on two Bantu languages:systematic data scaling analysis on Kinyarwanda using training sets from 1 to1,400 hours, and detailed error characterization on Kikuyu using 270 hours oftraining data. Our scaling experiments demonstrate that practical ASRperformance (WER &lt; 13\%) becomes achievable with as little as 50 hours oftraining data, with substantial improvements continuing through 200 hours (WER&lt; 10\%). Complementing these volume-focused findings, our error analysisreveals that data quality issues, particularly noisy ground truthtranscriptions, account for 38.6\% of high-error cases, indicating that carefuldata curation is as critical as data volume for robust system performance.These results provide actionable benchmarks and deployment guidance for teamsdeveloping ASR systems across similar low-resource language contexts.

We presentMemory-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that equips LLMs with theability to actively manage and utilize external memory through two specializedagents: a Memory Manager that learns structured operations, including ADD,UPDATE, DELETE, and NOOP; and an Answer Agent that pre-selects and reasons overrelevant entries. Both agents are fine-tuned with outcome-driven RL (PPO andGRPO), enabling adaptive memory management with minimal supervision. With only152 training QA pairs, Memory-R1 outperforms strong baselines and generalizesacross diverse question types, three benchmarks (LoCoMo, MSC, LongMemEval), andmultiple model scales (3B-14B).</description><author>Sikuan Yan, Xiufeng Yang, Zuchao Huang, Ercong Nie, Zifeng Ding, Zonggen Li, Xiaowen Ma, Kristian Kersting, Jeff Z.

However, the conventional FL method canintroduce security risks when dealing with diverse client data, potentiallycompromising privacy and data integrity. To address these challenges, wepresent a differential privacy (DP) federated deep learning framework inmedical image segmentation. In this paper, we extend our similarity weightaggregation (SimAgg) method to DP-SimAgg algorithm, a differentially privatesimilarity-weighted aggregation algorithm for brain tumor segmentation inmulti-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our DP-SimAgg method not onlyenhances model segmentation capabilities but also provides an additional layerof privacy preservation. Extensive benchmarking and evaluation of ourframework, with computational performance as a key consideration, demonstratethat DP-SimAgg enables accurate and robust brain tumor segmentation whileminimizing communication costs during model training. This advancement iscrucial for preserving the privacy of medical image data and safeguardingsensitive information. In conclusion, adding a differential privacy layer inthe global weight aggregation phase of the federated brain tumor segmentationprovides a promising solution to privacy concerns without compromisingsegmentation model efficacy.

Yet, in stark contrast to most other families of banditalgorithms, the exact mechanism through which posterior sampling (as introducedby Thompson) is able to "properly" balance exploration and exploitation,remains a mystery. In this paper we show that the core insight to address thisquestion stems from recasting Thompson Sampling as an online optimizationalgorithm. To distill this, a key conceptual tool is introduced, which we referto as "faithful" stationarization of the regret formulation. Essentially, thefinite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationarycounterpart which "closely resembles" the original objective (in contrast, theclassical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittinsindex, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner). The newlycrafted time invariant objective can be studied using Bellman's principle whichleads to a time invariant optimal policy. When viewed through this lens,Thompson Sampling admits a simple online optimization form that mimics thestructure of the Bellman-optimal policy, and where greediness is regularized bya measure of residual uncertainty based on point-biserial correlation. Thisanswers the question of how Thompson Sampling balancesexploration-exploitation, and moreover, provides a principled framework tostudy and further improve Thompson's original idea.</description><author>Yanlin Qu, Hongseok Namkoong, Assaf Zeevi</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:43:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07208v1</guid></item><item><title>EigenScore: OOD Detection using Covariance in Diffusion Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07206v1</link><description>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment ofmachine learning systems in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models haverecently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complexdata distributions through iterative denoising. Building on this progress,recent work has explored their potential for OOD detection. We proposeEigenScore, a new OOD detection method that leverages the eigenvalue spectrumof the posterior covariance induced by a diffusion model. We argue thatposterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift,leading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clearspectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posteriorcovariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal forOOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspaceiteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forwardevaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance,with up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline. Notably, it remainsrobust in near-OOD settings such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100, where existingdiffusion-based methods often fail.</description><author>Shirin Shoushtari, Yi Wang, Xiao Shi, M.

This paper advances MoEtheory by providing convergence guarantees for joint training of soft-routedMoE models with non-linear routers and experts in a student-teacher framework.We prove that, with moderate over-parameterization, the student networkundergoes a feature learning phase, where the router's learning process is``guided'' by the experts, that recovers the teacher's parameters.

Suchsymmetric games commonly arise in real-world interactions between "symmetric"agents who have identically defined utility functions -- such as Bertrandcompetition, multi-agent performative prediction, and certain congestion games-- and display a rich multiplicity of equilibria despite the seemingly simplesetting. Somewhat surprisingly, we show through a first-principles analysisthat the exponential weights dynamic, which is popular in online learning,converges in the last iterate for such games regardless of initialization withan appropriately chosen step size. For certain games and/or initializations, wefurther show that the convergence rate is in fact exponential and holds for anystep size. We illustrate our theory with extensive simulations and applications to theaforementioned game-theoretic interactions. In the case of multi-agentperformative prediction, we formulate a new "mortgage competition" game betweenlenders (i.e. banks) who interact with a population of customers, and show thatit fits into our framework.</description><author>Guanghui Wang, Krishna Acharya, Lokranjan Lakshmikanthan, Juba Ziani, Vidya Muthukumar</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:32:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08063v2</guid></item><item><title>AerialVG: A Challenging Benchmark for Aerial Visual Grounding by Exploring Positional Relations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07836v4</link><description>Visual grounding (VG) aims to localize target objects in an image based onnatural language descriptions. In this paper, we propose AerialVG, a new taskfocusing on visual grounding from aerial views. Compared to traditional VG,AerialVG poses new challenges, \emph{e.g.}, appearance-based grounding isinsufficient to distinguish among multiple visually similar objects, andpositional relations should be emphasized. Besides, existing VG models strugglewhen applied to aerial imagery, where high-resolution images cause significantdifficulties. To address these challenges, we introduce the first AerialVGdataset, consisting of 5K real-world aerial images, 50K manually annotateddescriptions, and 103K objects. Particularly, each annotation in AerialVGdataset contains multiple target objects annotated with relative spatialrelations, requiring models to perform comprehensive spatial reasoning.Furthermore, we propose an innovative model especially for the AerialVG task,where a Hierarchical Cross-Attention is devised to focus on target regions, anda Relation-Aware Grounding module is designed to infer positional relations.Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our dataset and method,highlighting the importance of spatial reasoning in aerial visual grounding.The code and dataset will be released.</description><author>Junli Liu, Qizhi Chen, Zhigang Wang, Yiwen Tang, Yiting Zhang, Chi Yan, Dong Wang, Xuelong Li, Bin Zhao</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:28:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07836v4</guid></item><item><title>Multi-modal Segment Assemblage Network for Ad Video Editing with Importance-Coherence Reward</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12164v2</link><description>Advertisement video editing aims to automatically edit advertising videosinto shorter videos while retaining coherent content and crucial informationconveyed by advertisers. It mainly contains two stages: video segmentation andsegment assemblage. The existing method performs well at video segmentationstages but suffers from the problems of dependencies on extra cumbersome modelsand poor performance at the segment assemblage stage. To address theseproblems, we propose M-SAN (Multi-modal Segment Assemblage Network) which canperform efficient and coherent segment assemblage task end-to-end.

Thecovert (verifiable) learning model of Canetti and Karchmer (TCC 2021) providesa framework for endowing classical learning algorithms with such guarantees. Inthis work, we propose models of covert verifiable learning in quantum learningtheory and realize them without computational hardness assumptions for remotedata access scenarios motivated by established quantum data advantages. Weconsider two privacy notions: (i) strategy-covertness, where the eavesdropperdoes not gain information about the learner's strategy; and (ii)target-covertness, where the eavesdropper does not gain information about theunknown object being learned. We show: Strategy-covert algorithms for makingquantum statistical queries via classical shadows; Target-covert algorithms forlearning quadratic functions from public quantum examples and private quantumstatistical queries, for Pauli shadow tomography and stabilizer state learningfrom public multi-copy and private single-copy quantum measurements, and forsolving Forrelation and Simon's problem from public quantum queries and privateclassical queries, where the adversary is a unidirectional or i.i.d.ancilla-free eavesdropper. The lattermost results in particular establish thatthe exponential separation between classical and quantum queries forForrelation and Simon's problem survives under covertness constraints. Alongthe way, we design covert verifiable protocols for quantum data acquisitionfrom public quantum queries which may be of independent interest.

Existing work hasstudied pretraining poisoning assuming adversaries control a percentage of thetraining corpus. However, for large models, even small percentages translate toimpractically large amounts of data. This work demonstrates for the first timethat poisoning attacks instead require a near-constant number of documentsregardless of dataset size. We conduct the largest pretraining poisoningexperiments to date, pretraining models from 600M to 13B parameters onchinchilla-optimal datasets (6B to 260B tokens). We find that 250 poisoneddocuments similarly compromise models across all model and dataset sizes,despite the largest models training on more than 20 times more clean data. Wealso run smaller-scale experiments to ablate factors that could influenceattack success, including broader ratios of poisoned to clean data andnon-random distributions of poisoned samples. Finally, we demonstrate the samedynamics for poisoning during fine-tuning. Altogether, our results suggest thatinjecting backdoors through data poisoning may be easier for large models thanpreviously believed as the number of poisons required does not scale up withmodel size, highlighting the need for more research on defences to mitigatethis risk in future models.</description><author>Alexandra Souly, Javier Rando, Ed Chapman, Xander Davies, Burak Hasircioglu, Ezzeldin Shereen, Carlos Mougan, Vasilios Mavroudis, Erik Jones, Chris Hicks, Nicholas Carlini, Yarin Gal, Robert Kirk</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:25:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07192v1</guid></item><item><title>Resolution scaling governs DINOv3 transfer performance in chest radiograph classification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07191v1</link><description>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced visual representation learning,but its value in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality withfine-grained findings, remains unclear. Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSLmodels through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choicesimprove transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematicallytested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization acrossseven datasets (n&gt;814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated:ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. Theprimary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2achieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 andImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences acrossinitializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Modelsusing frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed relative to fully finetuned86-89M-parameter backbones, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation.Scaling to 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy.

Inchest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging thebenefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practicalupper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongestperformance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost.

The emergent capabilities of Vid-LLMs are surprisinglyadvanced, particularly their ability for open-ended multi-granularity (general,temporal, and spatiotemporal) reasoning combined with commonsense knowledge,suggesting a promising path for future video understanding. We examine theunique characteristics and capabilities of Vid-LLMs, categorizing theapproaches into three main types: Video Analyzer x LLM, Video Embedder x LLM,and (Analyzer + Embedder) x LLM. Furthermore, we identify five sub-types basedon the functions of LLMs in Vid-LLMs: LLM as Summarizer, LLM as Manager, LLM asText Decoder, LLM as Regressor, and LLM as Hidden Layer. Furthermore, thissurvey presents a comprehensive study of the tasks, datasets, benchmarks, andevaluation methodologies for Vid-LLMs. Additionally, it explores the expansiveapplications of Vid-LLMs across various domains, highlighting their remarkablescalability and versatility in real-world video understanding challenges.Finally, it summarizes the limitations of existing Vid-LLMs and outlinesdirections for future research.

Nevertheless, current methods primarilyconcentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view whilestruggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus onhuman-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework forcreating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. Toachieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet datasetand incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use thecamera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, whicheffectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. Tomaintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-viewhuman-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the referencevideo, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide arobust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigatesthe artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation.

However, current backdoor-based fingerprinting methodsface a fundamental trade-off: fingerprints embedded as garbled text are easilydetected and filtered, whereas those crafted as coherent natural language areprone to being triggered unintentionally. To overcome these limitations, wepropose RFEdit, a knowledge-editing framework that embeds a rule-basedmultilingual natural language fingerprint (MNLF) by modifying a sparse subsetof model weights. This approach enables efficient and robust fingerprintinjection with minimal impact on unrelated knowledge in LLMs. Our RFEditframework is further safeguarded by Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning(FSFT), which mitigates fingerprint degradation during legitimate fine-tuningby restricting parameter updates to the fingerprint subspace. This approachpreserves fingerprint integrity while enhancing downstream task performance ofLLMs. These advances establish a comprehensive pipeline from fingerprintinjection to defense, achieving high detection effectiveness, robustnessagainst adversarial manipulations, harmlessness to model utility, andpersistence under fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RFEditmaintains robustness under quantization and pruning. Additionally, fingerprinteffectiveness is generally improved by more than 10\% when combined with FSFTfor math and alpaca downstream tasks.</description><author>Yue Li, Xin Yi, Dongsheng Shi, Yongyi Cui, Gerard de Melo, Linlin Wang</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:23:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03122v2</guid></item><item><title>Split Conformal Classification with Unsupervised Calibration</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07185v1</link><description>Methods for split conformal prediction leverage calibration samples totransform any prediction rule into a set-prediction rule that complies with atarget coverage probability. Existing methods provide remarkably strongperformance guarantees with minimal computational costs. However, they requireto use calibration samples composed by labeled examples different to those usedfor training. This requirement can be highly inconvenient, as it prevents theuse of all labeled examples for training and may require acquiring additionallabels solely for calibration.

In the proposed approach, set-prediction rules are obtained usingunsupervised calibration samples together with supervised training samplespreviously used to learn the classification rule.

However,construction sites present significant challenges for traditional trackingmethods due to featureless surfaces, dynamic changes, and drift accumulation,leading to misalignment between digital models and the physical world. Thispaper proposes a BIM-aware drift correction method to address these challenges.Instead of relying solely on SLAM-based localization, we align ``as-built"detected planes from the real-world environment with ``as-planned"architectural planes in BIM. Our method performs robust plane matching andcomputes a transformation (TF) between SLAM (S) and BIM (B) origin frames usingoptimization techniques, minimizing drift over time. By incorporating BIM asprior structural knowledge, we can achieve improved long-term localization andenhanced AR visualization accuracy in noisy construction environments. Themethod is evaluated through real-world experiments, showing significantreductions in drift-induced errors and optimized alignment consistency.

Most existingportfolio optimization methods require information on the distribution ofreturns of the assets that make up the portfolio. However, such distributioninformation is usually unknown to investors. Various methods have been proposedto estimate distribution information, but their accuracy greatly depends on theuncertainty of the financial markets. Due to this uncertainty, a model thatcould well predict the distribution information at one point in time mayperform less accurately compared to another model at a different time. To solvethis problem, we investigate a method for portfolio optimization based onBayesian predictive synthesis (BPS), one of the Bayesian ensemble methods formeta-learning. We assume that investors have access to multiple asset returnprediction models. By using BPS with dynamic linear models to combine thesepredictions, we can obtain a Bayesian predictive posterior about the meanrewards of assets that accommodate the uncertainty of the financial markets. Inthis study, we examine how to construct mean-variance portfolios andquantile-based portfolios based on the predicted distribution information.</description><author>Masahiro Kato, Kentaro Baba, Hibiki Kaibuchi, Ryo Inokuchi</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:18:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07180v1</guid></item><item><title>Biasless Language Models Learn Unnaturally: How LLMs Fail to Distinguish the Possible from the Impossible</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07178v1</link><description>Are large language models (LLMs) sensitive to the distinction between humanlypossible languages and humanly impossible languages? This question is taken bymany to bear on whether LLMs and humans share the same innate learning biases.Previous work has attempted to answer it in the positive by comparing LLMlearning curves on existing language datasets and on "impossible" datasetsderived from them via various perturbation functions. Using the samemethodology, we examine this claim on a wider set of languages and impossibleperturbations. We find that in most cases, GPT-2 learns each language and itsimpossible counterpart equally easily, in contrast to previous claims. We alsoapply a more lenient condition by testing whether GPT-2 provides any kind ofseparation between the whole set of natural languages and the whole set ofimpossible languages. By considering cross-linguistic variance in variousmetrics computed on the perplexity curves, we show that GPT-2 provides nosystematic separation between the possible and the impossible. Taken together,these perspectives show that LLMs do not share the human innate biases thatshape linguistic typology.</description><author>Imry Ziv, Nur Lan, Emmanuel Chemla, Roni Katzir</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:17:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07178v1</guid></item><item><title>CARPAS: Towards Content-Aware Refinement of Provided Aspects for Summarization in Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07177v1</link><description>Aspect-based summarization has attracted significant attention for itsability to generate more fine-grained and user-aligned summaries. While mostexisting approaches assume a set of predefined aspects as input, real-worldscenarios often present challenges where these given aspects may be incomplete,irrelevant, or entirely missing from the document. Users frequently expectsystems to adaptively refine or filter the provided aspects based on the actualcontent. In this paper, we initiate this novel task setting, termedContent-Aware Refinement of Provided Aspects for Summarization (CARPAS), withthe aim of dynamically adjusting the provided aspects based on the documentcontext before summarizing. We construct three new datasets to facilitate ourpilot experiments, and by using LLMs with four representative promptingstrategies in this task, we find that LLMs tend to predict an overlycomprehensive set of aspects, which often results in excessively long andmisaligned summaries. Building on this observation, we propose a preliminarysubtask to predict the number of relevant aspects, and demonstrate that thepredicted number can serve as effective guidance for the LLMs, reducing theinference difficulty, and enabling them to focus on the most pertinent aspects.Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach significantlyimproves performance across all datasets. Moreover, our deeper analyses uncoverLLMs' compliance when the requested number of aspects differs from their ownestimations, establishing a crucial insight for the deployment of LLMs insimilar real-world applications.</description><author>Yong-En Tian, Yu-Chien Tang, An-Zi Yen, Wen-Chih Peng</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:16:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07177v1</guid></item><item><title>Quantifying Data Contamination in Psychometric Evaluations of LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07175v1</link><description>Recent studies apply psychometric questionnaires to Large Language Models(LLMs) to assess high-level psychological constructs such as values,personality, moral foundations, and dark traits. Although prior work has raisedconcerns about possible data contamination from psychometric inventories, whichmay threaten the reliability of such evaluations, there has been no systematicattempt to quantify the extent of this contamination. To address this gap, wepropose a framework to systematically measure data contamination inpsychometric evaluations of LLMs, evaluating three aspects: (1) itemmemorization, (2) evaluation memorization, and (3) target score matching.Applying this framework to 21 models from major families and four widely usedpsychometric inventories, we provide evidence that popular inventories such asthe Big Five Inventory (BFI-44) and Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ-40)exhibit strong contamination, where models not only memorize items but can alsoadjust their responses to achieve specific target scores.</description><author>Jongwook Han, Woojung Song, Jonggeun Lee, Yohan Jo</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:16:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07175v1</guid></item><item><title>NurseLLM: The First Specialized Language Model for Nursing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07173v1</link><description>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantlytransformed medical systems. However, their potential within specializeddomains such as nursing remains largely underexplored. In this work, weintroduce NurseLLM, the first nursing-specialized LLM tailored for multiplechoice question-answering (MCQ) tasks. We develop a multi-stage data generationpipeline to build the first large scale nursing MCQ dataset to train LLMs on abroad spectrum of nursing topics. We further introduce multiple nursingbenchmarks to enable rigorous evaluation. Our extensive experiments demonstratethat NurseLLM outperforms SoTA general-purpose and medical-specialized LLMs ofcomparable size on different benchmarks, underscoring the importance of aspecialized LLM for the nursing domain. Finally, we explore the role ofreasoning and multi-agent collaboration systems in nursing, highlighting theirpromise for future research and applications.</description><author>Md Tawkat Islam Khondaker, Julia Harrington, Shady Shehata</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:15:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07173v1</guid></item></channel></rss>
