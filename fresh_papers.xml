Weintroduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AIassistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Evalcomprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasksinclude natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turndialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highlyheterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21open-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the responsecontent and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three keyfindings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-sourcemodels; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding;and (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, themid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listeningaccuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal(audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult forcurrent models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safetyalignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorousframework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AIassistants.

SPF iscapable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructionsin any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches thattreat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is toconsider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPFharnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterativeannotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predictedtraveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacementvectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts thetraveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPFperforms navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to followdynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRLsimulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolutemargin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strongbaselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies tohighlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkablegeneralization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev</description><author>Chih Yao Hu, Yang-Sen Lin, Yuna Lee, Chih-Hai Su, Jie-Ying Lee, Shr-Ruei Tsai, Chin-Yang Lin, Kuan-Wen Chen, Tsung-Wei Ke, Yu-Lun Liu</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 17:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22653v1</guid></item><item><title>Pixel Motion Diffusion is What We Need for Robot Control</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22652v1</link><description>We present DAWN (Diffusion is All We Need for robot control), a unifieddiffusion-based framework for language-conditioned robotic manipulation thatbridges high-level motion intent and low-level robot action via structuredpixel motion representation. In DAWN, both the high-level and low-levelcontrollers are modeled as diffusion processes, yielding a fully trainable,end-to-end system with interpretable intermediate motion abstractions. DAWNachieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging CALVIN benchmark,demonstrating strong multi-task performance, and further validates itseffectiveness on MetaWorld. Despite the substantial domain gap betweensimulation and reality and limited real-world data, we demonstrate reliablereal-world transfer with only minimal finetuning, illustrating the practicalviability of diffusion-based motion abstractions for robotic control. Ourresults show the effectiveness of combining diffusion modeling withmotion-centric representations as a strong baseline for scalable and robustrobot learning.

Meanwhile,large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, weintroduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, fromdiffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architecturalmodifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate thesefeatures, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanningboth images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attentionmagnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layersand show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliarytokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further proposean attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partitionbackground activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and morelocalized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simpletraining-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAShandling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and videosegmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additionalcomponents.</description><author>Anna Kukleva, Enis Simsar, Alessio Tonioni, Muhammad Ferjad Naeem, Federico Tombari, Jan Eric Lenssen, Bernt Schiele</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 17:59:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22650v1</guid></item><item><title>Toward a Physics of Deep Learning and Brains</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22649v1</link><description>Deep neural networks and brains both learn and share superficialsimilarities: processing nodes are likened to neurons and adjustable weightsare likened to modifiable synapses. But can a unified theoretical framework befound to underlie them both? Here we show that the equations used to describeneuronal avalanches in living brains can also be applied to cascades ofactivity in deep neural networks. These equations are derived fromnon-equilibrium statistical physics and show that deep neural networks learnbest when poised between absorbing and active phases. Because these networksare strongly driven by inputs, however, they do not operate at a true criticalpoint but within a quasi-critical regime -- one that still approximatelysatisfies crackling noise scaling relations. By training networks withdifferent initializations, we show that maximal susceptibility is a morereliable predictor of learning than proximity to the critical point itself.This provides a blueprint for engineering improved network performance.Finally, using finite-size scaling we identify distinct universality classes,including Barkhausen noise and directed percolation. This theoretical frameworkdemonstrates that universal features are shared by both biological andartificial neural networks.</description><author>Arsham Ghavasieh, Meritxell Vila-Minana, Akanksha Khurd, John Beggs, Gerardo Ortiz, Santo Fortunato</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 17:59:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22649v1</guid></item><item><title>UIP2P: Unsupervised Instruction-based Image Editing via Edit Reversibility Constraint</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15216v2</link><description>We propose an unsupervised instruction-based image editing approach thatremoves the need for ground-truth edited images during training. Existingmethods rely on supervised learning with triplets of input images, ground-truthedited images, and edit instructions. These triplets are typically generatedeither by existing editing methods, introducing biases, or through humanannotations, which are costly and limit generalization. Our approach addressesthese challenges by introducing a novel editing mechanism called EditReversibility Constraint (ERC), which applies forward and reverse edits in onetraining step and enforces alignment in image, text, and attention spaces. Thisallows us to bypass the need for ground-truth edited images and unlock trainingfor the first time on datasets comprising either real image-caption pairs orimage-caption-instruction triplets. We empirically show that our approachperforms better across a broader range of edits with high-fidelity andprecision. By eliminating the need for pre-existing datasets of triplets,reducing biases associated with current methods, and proposing ERC, our workrepresents a significant advancement in unblocking scaling of instruction-basedimage editing.</description><author>Enis Simsar, Alessio Tonioni, Yongqin Xian, Thomas Hofmann, Federico Tombari</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 17:59:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15216v2</guid></item><item><title>CapRL: Stimulating Dense Image Caption Capabilities via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22647v1</link><description>Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguisticdomains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained withSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalabledata annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads tomodels that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generalityand ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome thelimitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning withVerifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for theinherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduceCaptioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework thatredefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption shouldenable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about thecorresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLMgenerates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of aseparate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely onthat caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective imagecaptioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiplesettings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3Bresults in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the PrismFramework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparableto Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.Code is available here: https://github.com/InternLM/CapRL.</description><author>Long Xing, Xiaoyi Dong, Yuhang Zang, Yuhang Cao, Jianze Liang, Qidong Huang, Jiaqi Wang, Feng Wu, Dahua Lin</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 17:59:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22647v1</guid></item><item><title>KV Cache Steering for Controlling Frozen LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08799v2</link><description>We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering oflanguage models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-valuecache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to inducechain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach constructssteering vectors from reasoning traces, obtained either from teacher models(e.g., GPT-4o) or existing human annotations, that shift model behavior towardmore explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning or promptmodifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarksdemonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative structure ofmodel reasoning and quantitative task performance. Additional experiments showthat the method also scales to larger models and yields further gains onchallenging datasets such as GPQA and MATH. Compared to prior activationsteering techniques that require continuous interventions, our one-shot cachesteering offers substantial advantages in terms of inference latency,hyperparameter stability, and ease of integration with existing inference APIs.Beyond mere reasoning induction, we show that cache steering enablescontrollable transfer of reasoning styles (e.g., stepwise, causal, analogical),making it a practical tool for behavior-level guidance of language models.</description><author>Max Belitsky, Dawid J.

We introduce DeeptraceReward, thefirst fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotateshuman-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Eachannotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-boxregion containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offsettimestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories ofdeepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and trainmultimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments andlocalizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake tracedetection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural languageexplanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides arigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy videogeneration.</description><author>Xingyu Fu, Siyi Liu, Yinuo Xu, Pan Lu, Guangqiuse Hu, Tianbo Yang, Taran Anantasagar, Christopher Shen, Yikai Mao, Yuanzhe Liu, Keyush Shah, Chung Un Lee, Yejin Choi, James Zou, Dan Roth, Chris Callison-Burch</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 17:59:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22646v1</guid></item><item><title>Hierarchical Representation Matching for CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22645v1</link><description>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability tocontinuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trainedvision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for thistask. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visualconcepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grainedcues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on therepresentation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical informationcontained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchicalRepresentation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leveragesLLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, therebyaugmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. Thesedescriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy andadaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precisediscrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our methodconsistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description><author>Zhen-Hao Wen, Yan Wang, Ji Feng, Han-Jia Ye, De-Chuan Zhan, Da-Wei Zhou</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 17:59:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22645v1</guid></item><item><title>WebGen-Agent: Enhancing Interactive Website Generation with Multi-Level Feedback and Step-Level Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22644v1</link><description>Agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstratedimpressive performance on repository-level code-generation tasks. However, fortasks such as website codebase generation, which depend heavily on visualeffects and user-interaction feedback, current code agents rely only on simplecode execution for feedback and verification. This approach fails to capturethe actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we proposeWebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive andmulti-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the websitecodebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regardingthe screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visuallanguage model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. Thescreenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking andselect-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent. Utilizing theaccurate visual scores inherent in the WebGen-Agent workflow, we furtherintroduce \textit{Step-GRPO with Screenshot and GUI-agent Feedback} to improvethe ability of LLMs to act as the reasoning engine of WebGen-Agent. By usingthe screenshot and GUI-agent scores at each step as the reward in Step-GRPO, weprovide a dense and reliable process supervision signal, which effectivelyimproves the model's website-generation ability. On the WebGen-Bench dataset,WebGen-Agent increases the accuracy of Claude-3.5-Sonnet from 26.4% to 51.9%and its appearance score from 3.0 to 3.9, outperforming the previousstate-of-the-art agent system.

This approach is in stark contrast to current videomodels, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore strugglewith grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our centralhypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded inextensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test thishypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world modeltrained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal thatthe model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution ofplausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physicalhallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability canbe actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, wherevision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide itsrefinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, aco-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans intoexecutable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. Weestablish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causalreasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in bothhuman and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physicalcausality, collision dynamics, and object permanence.

More recently, it has also beenadopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical workon creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does notaccount for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) andappropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate therelationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542expert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicalityvia close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gramnovelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% oftop-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative,cautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlikehuman-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates withlower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-sourcemodels, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creativeexpressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot,few-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (apositive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect).Overall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leaveroom for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmaticexpressions. We further find that LLM-as-a-Judge novelty scores from thebest-performing model were predictive of expert writer preferences.</description><author>Arkadiy Saakyan, Najoung Kim, Smaranda Muresan, Tuhin Chakrabarty</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 17:59:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22641v1</guid></item><item><title>Language Models Can Learn from Verbal Feedback Without Scalar Rewards</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22638v1</link><description>LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methodstypically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much oftheir richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbalfeedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-imagegeneration, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce thefeedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedbackpairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximumlikelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrappingstage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives freshfeedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning asconditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a moreexpressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback.

In this paper, we investigate explorationprinciples for online RLHF, where one seeks to adaptively collect newpreference data to refine both the reward model and the policy in adata-efficient manner. By examining existing optimism-based explorationalgorithms, we identify a drawback in their sampling protocol: they tend togather comparisons that fail to reduce the most informative uncertainties inreward differences, and we prove lower bounds showing that such methods canincur linear regret over exponentially long horizons. Motivated by thisinsight, we propose a new exploration scheme that directs preference queriestoward reducing uncertainty in reward differences most relevant to policyimprovement. Under a multi-armed bandit model of RLHF, we establish regretbounds of order $T^{(\beta+1)/(\beta+2)}$, where $\beta&gt;0$ is a hyperparameterthat balances reward maximization against mitigating distribution shift.

Avaluable goal for all such models is robustness: the ability to perform well onout-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. We assess whether fine-tuning preserves theoverall robustness of the pretrained model, and observed that models pretrainedon large datasets exhibited strong catastrophic forgetting and loss of OODgeneralization. To systematically assess robustness preservation in fine-tunedmodels, we propose the Robustness Inheritance Benchmark (ImageNet-RIB). Thebenchmark, which can be applied to any pretrained model, consists of a set ofrelated but distinct OOD (downstream) tasks and involves fine-tuning on one ofthe OOD tasks in the set then testing on the rest. We find that thoughcontinual learning methods help, fine-tuning reduces robustness acrosspretrained models. Surprisingly, models pretrained on the largest and mostdiverse datasets (e.g., LAION-2B) exhibit both larger robustness losses andlower absolute robustness after fine-tuning on small datasets, relative tomodels pretrained on smaller datasets. These findings suggest that startingwith the strongest foundation model is not necessarily the best approach forperformance on specialist tasks. https://jd730.github.io/projects/ImageNet-RIB</description><author>Jaedong Hwang, Brian Cheung, Zhang-Wei Hong, Akhilan Boopathy, Pulkit Agrawal, Ila Fiete</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 17:57:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21582v3</guid></item><item><title>LABELING COPILOT: A Deep Research Agent for Automated Data Curation in Computer Vision</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22631v1</link><description>Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck fordeploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between dataquality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. Weintroduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent forcomputer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodallanguage model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools acrossthree core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesisgenerates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiplefoundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximumsuppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness ofLabeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at objectdiscovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals perimage-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotationmAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme classimbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capabilityto over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40xmore computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sampleefficiency.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linearattention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constantper-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasksthat require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts,because all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrentstate. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlatedwith the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrentstates results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, atraining pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNsthrough post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention andstate space models, we design post-training architectural modifications toscale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters.Experiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficientlyenhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurringhigh post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.</description><author>Xingyu Shen, Yingfa Chen, Zhen Leng Thai, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 17:55:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22630v1</guid></item><item><title>UML-CoT: Structured Reasoning and Planning with Unified Modeling Language for Robotic Room Cleaning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22628v1</link><description>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability andexecutability in embodied tasks.

These scenarios commonly operateunder constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer aneffective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate thedisparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectifiedsystem. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth dataacross diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novelself-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existingstate-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architectureemploys a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolarcross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesignof the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXtachieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-artresults in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth andDriving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques.

Recent deep learningapproaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees ongeneralization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of theselimitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimizationproblem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function thatenforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this methodyields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance thancompressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study thesample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions andthe structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten thebound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize.Replacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives boundsthat depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graphsize. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalizationguarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.</description><author>Ehsan Futuhi, Nathan R.

However, RLHF incurs high costs and potentialreward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR stillwastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after eachupdate. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy AndReward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stablemethod that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctnessdata, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train themodel itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mixof objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, andevaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model toevaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for aseparate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates apositive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields betterpolicy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that furtherrefine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling viaself-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. Weshow that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLMmodels and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks.

Long video generation presentschallenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcingmodels can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due tobidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching forfaster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memorychallenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-basedgeneration, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, arecritical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives inreal time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompttransitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-levelAR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached stateswith new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enablelong video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten asframe sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip modelto minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in bothshort and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a singleH100 GPU.

In contrast,In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions ordemonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and morecalibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost ofmore inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internalcomputations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICLand SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methodsachieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by thisobservation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL ActivationAlignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL'sactivation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracyand calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical resultson 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families.

Applying thesetechniques individually to each layer in large models is computationallyexpensive and incurs additional memory costs due to storing the projectionmatrices. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient and conceptuallysimple, two-step procedure to approximate SVD/QR-based gradient projectionsinto lower-dimensional spaces by using a predefined orthogonal matrix of theDiscrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We dynamically select columns from the DCTmatrix based on their alignment with the gradient of each layer. The effectiveprojection matrices are obtained via a simple matmul with the DCT matrix in$O(n^3)$ time, followed by a lightweight sorting step to identify the mostrelevant basis vectors. For large layers, DCT can be computed via Makhoul's$N$-point algorithm based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in $O(n^2 \log(n))$time. Due to the predefined nature of the orthogonal bases, they are computedonce at the start of training. Our numerical experiments on both pre-trainingand fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual strategy inapproximating optimal low-rank projections, obtaining an approach withrank-independent running time that matches the performance of costlySVD/QR-based methods while achieving faster runtime and reduced memory usage byup to $25\%$ across different model sizes.

Existing methods for querying 3D Gaussian Splattingoften struggle with inconsistent 2D mask supervision and lack a robust 3Dpoint-level retrieval mechanism. In this work, (i) we present a novelpoint-level querying framework that performs tracking on segmentation masks toestablish a semantically consistent ground-truth for distilling the languageGaussians; (ii) we introduce a GT-anchored querying approach that firstretrieves the distilled ground-truth and subsequently uses the ground-truth toquery the individual Gaussians. Extensive experiments on three benchmarkdatasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-artperformance. Our method achieves an mIoU improvement of +4.14, +20.42, and +1.7on the LERF, 3D-OVS, and Replica datasets.

To explore how to improve theperformance of methods on both tasks simultaneously by enhancing long-rangetemporal understanding capabilities, we introduce TAMMs, the first unifiedframework designed to jointly perform TCD and FSIF within a singleMLLM-diffusion architecture. TAMMs introduces two key innovations: TemporalAdaptation Modules (TAM) enhance frozen MLLM's ability to comprehend long-rangedynamics, and Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism translates thischange understanding into fine-grained generative control.

Prior theoretical models in SC assume that agents are perfectly orapproximately rational and respond to decision policies by optimizing theirutility. However, the growing prevalence of LLMs raises the possibility thatreal-world agents may instead rely on these tools for strategic advice. Thisshift prompts two questions: (i) Can LLMs generate effective and sociallyresponsible strategies in SC settings? (ii) Can existing SC theoretical modelsaccurately capture agent behavior when agents follow LLM-generated advice? Toinvestigate these questions, we examine five critical SC scenarios: hiring,loan applications, school admissions, personal income, and public assistanceprograms. We simulate agents with diverse profiles who interact with threecommercial LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5), following their suggestions oneffort allocations on features. We compare the resulting agent behaviors withthe best responses in existing SC models. Our findings show that: (i) Evenwithout access to the decision policy, LLMs can generate effective strategiesthat improve both agents' scores and qualification; (ii) At the populationlevel, LLM-guided effort allocation strategies yield similar or even higherscore improvements, qualification rates, and fairness metrics as thosepredicted by the SC theoretical model, suggesting that the theoretical modelmay still serve as a reasonable proxy for LLM-influenced behavior; and (iii) Atthe individual level, LLMs tend to produce more diverse and balanced effortallocations than theoretical models.</description><author>Tian Xie, Pavan Rauch, Xueru Zhang</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 17:21:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16355v2</guid></item><item><title>Learn the Ropes, Then Trust the Wins: Self-imitation with Progressive Exploration for Agentic Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22601v1</link><description>Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategictool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, butsuch mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due tothe multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressiveexploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent ownexperiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runawaydivergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where areplay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policyupdate, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced rangeof entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculumto manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to fosterskill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in theaccumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliardistributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. Astraining progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existingsuccessful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-levelexploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences inthe replay buffer to address the potential policy drift.

In recent years,the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance has attracted growing interestbecause it enables the comparison of structured data by jointly accounting forfeature similarity and geometric structure. However, as a variant of optimaltransport (OT), classical FGW assumes an equal mass constraint on the compareddata. In this work, we relax this mass constraint and propose the Fused PartialGromov-Wasserstein (FPGW) framework, which extends FGW to accommodateunbalanced data. Theoretically, we establish the relationship between FPGW andFGW and prove the metric properties of FPGW.

Subsequently, in order to reduce thereliance on the unknown parameters $\alpha,\gamma,\beta$ inherent in the\texttt{MA-SPL} algorithm, we further introduce the second online algorithmnamed \texttt{MA-MPL}. This \texttt{MA-MPL} algorithm is entirely\emph{parameter-free} and simultaneously can maintain the same approximationratio as the first \texttt{MA-SPL} algorithm. The core of our \texttt{MA-SPL}and \texttt{MA-MPL} algorithms is a novel continuous-relaxation techniquetermed as \emph{policy-based continuous extension}.

Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing thenumber of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generationapproach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generativeperformance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfullyapproximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. Inthis work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-basedsampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generatorsthat better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flowprocess.

Such loops were shown to lead to distributionshifts - models misrepresenting the true underlying distributions of human data(also called model collapse). However, how human data properties affect suchshifts remains poorly understood. In this paper, we provide the first empiricalexamination of the effect of such properties on the outcome of recursivetraining. We first confirm that using different human datasets leads todistribution shifts of different magnitudes. Through exhaustive manipulation ofdataset properties combined with regression analyses, we then identify a set ofproperties predicting distribution shift magnitudes. Lexical diversity is foundto amplify these shifts, while semantic diversity and data quality mitigatethem. Furthermore, we find that these influences are highly modular: datascrapped from a given internet domain has little influence on the contentgenerated for another domain. Finally, experiments on political bias revealthat human data properties affect whether the initial bias will be amplified orreduced.

This makes it difficult to provide statistically guaranteedclaims about the true state of a subject from scans reconstructed by thesealgorithms. In this study, we propose a framework for computing provably validprediction bounds on claims derived from probabilistic black-box imagereconstruction algorithms. The key insights behind our framework are torepresent reconstructed scans with a derived clinical metric of interest, andto calibrate bounds on the ground truth metric with conformal prediction (CP)using a prior calibration dataset. These bounds convey interpretable feedbackabout the subject's state, and can also be used to retrieve nearest-neighborreconstructed scans for visual inspection. We demonstrate the utility of thisframework on sparse-view computed tomography (CT) for fat mass quantificationand radiotherapy planning tasks.

In real-world settings, theorder in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and modelperformance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstreamevaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set ofrandomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical resultsdemonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performancerange, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of thetrue variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that arobust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate theentire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept ofextreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial rolein the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positivecorrelation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relationthat can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building onthese insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution andGeneralization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifiesand samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering acloser approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution.

We identify acritical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitationcascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy prematureconvergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promotingchaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularizedPolicy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cyclethrough three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization inmulti-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothingregularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to preventabrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balancesexploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPOguarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintainingconvergence.

Over thepast decade, deep learning has gained traction in this field, with mostexisting approaches relying on multimodal inputs, such as RGB combined withdepth (RGB-D), to classify time-sequence windows of sensory data as interactiveor non-interactive. In contrast, we propose a novel RGB-only pipeline forpredicting human interaction intent with frame-level precision, enabling fasterrobot responses and improved service quality. A key challenge in intentprediction is the class imbalance inherent in real-world HRI datasets, whichcan hinder the model's training and generalization. To address this, weintroduce MINT-RVAE, a synthetic sequence generation method, along with newloss functions and training strategies that enhance generalization onout-of-sample data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUROC:0.95) outperforming prior works (AUROC: 0.90-0.912), while requiring only RGBinput and supporting precise frame onset prediction.

However,existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlookingthe role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, weobserve that varying the number of activated experts yields complementarysolution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source ofdiversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllabledimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) DynamicMoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generatediverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) ExpertConfiguration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within areasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability anddiversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoEarchitectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code andknowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancingaccuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES asa practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating howstructural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.</description><author>Yixuan Han, Fan Ma, Ruijie Quan, Yi Yang</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 16:49:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22572v1</guid></item><item><title>Multi-View Hypercomplex Learning for Breast Cancer Screening</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05798v4</link><description>Radiologists interpret mammography exams by jointly analyzing all four views,as correlations among them are crucial for accurate diagnosis.

This challenge is greatly compoundedin multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approachthat compresses the policy parameter space $\Theta$ into a low-dimensionallatent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model$g:\mathcal{Z}\to\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, whichensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather thanproximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionalityof this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than thesize of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous controldomains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can becompressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of itsexpressivity.

However, LLM outputs may contain clinicalinaccuracies, omissions, or tone mismatches, making robust evaluationessential. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a clinicallygrounded error ontology comprising 5 domains and 59 granular error codes,developed through inductive coding and expert adjudication; (2) we develop aretrieval-augmented evaluation pipeline (RAEC) that leverages semanticallysimilar historical message-response pairs to improve judgment quality; and (3)we provide a two-stage prompting architecture using DSPy to enable scalable,interpretable, and hierarchical error detection. Our approach assesses thequality of drafts both in isolation and with reference to similar pastmessage-response pairs retrieved from institutional archives. Using a two-stageDSPy pipeline, we compared baseline and reference-enhanced evaluations on over1,500 patient messages. Retrieval context improved error identification indomains such as clinical completeness and workflow appropriateness. Humanvalidation on 100 messages demonstrated superior agreement (concordance = 50%vs. 33%) and performance (F1 = 0.500 vs. 0.256) of context-enhanced labels vs.baseline, supporting the use of our RAEC pipeline as AI guardrails for patientmessaging.</description><author>Wenyuan Chen, Fateme Nateghi Haredasht, Kameron C.

In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel frameworkdesigned with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, ourapproach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depthestimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regionswith a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliablealignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, wepropose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in afine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduceoverfitting.

We study this problem from the perspective of a broker, ina regret minimization framework. At each time step, a new seller and buyerarrive, and the broker has to propose a mechanism that is incentive-compatibleand individually rational, with the goal of maximizing profit. We propose a learning algorithm that guarantees a nearly tight$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the stochastic setting when seller and buyervaluations are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed and possibly correlated unknowndistribution. We further show that it is impossible to achieve sublinear regretin the non-stationary scenario where valuations are generated upfront by anadversary. Our ambitious benchmark for these results is the bestincentive-compatible and individually rational mechanism. This separates usfrom previous works on efficiency maximization in bilateral trade, where thebenchmark is a single number: the best fixed price in hindsight. A particular challenge we face is that uniform convergence for allmechanisms' profits is impossible. We overcome this difficulty via a carefulchaining analysis that proves convergence for a provably near-optimal mechanismat (essentially) optimal rate. We further showcase the broader applicability ofour techniques by providing nearly optimal results for the joint ads problem.</description><author>Simone Di Gregorio, Paul Dütting, Federico Fusco, Chris Schwiegelshohn</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 16:42:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22563v1</guid></item><item><title>Activation Function Design Sustains Plasticity in Continual Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22562v1</link><description>In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activationfunctions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrinkonce model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, thepicture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressivelylose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role ofthe non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show thatactivation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigatingplasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shapeand saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leakyand Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings:(i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learningwith non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlleddistribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol anddiagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation underchange. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers alightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learningwithout extra capacity or task-specific tuning.</description><author>Lute Lillo, Nick Cheney</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 16:41:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22562v1</guid></item><item><title>StepORLM: A Self-Evolving Framework With Generative Process Supervision For Operations Research Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22558v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solvingOperations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as apowerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generallyface two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the creditassignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing toevaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, weintroduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative processsupervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where apolicy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improveon each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holisticprocess evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align thepolicy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneouslyrefine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a newstate-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastlylarger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover,the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicableprocess verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance ofboth our own model and other existing LLMs.</description><author>Chenyu Zhou, Tianyi Xu, Jianghao Lin, Dongdong Ge</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 16:39:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22558v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning to Price Bundles: A GCN Approach for Mixed Bundling</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22557v1</link><description>Bundle pricing refers to designing several product combinations (i.e.,bundles) and determining their prices in order to maximize the expected profit.It is a classic problem in revenue management and arises in many industries,such as e-commerce, tourism, and video games. However, the problem is typicallyintractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper,we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving thebundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representationof the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with aspecific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimalbundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies toderive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is furtherproposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate theeffectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCNtrained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achievenear-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computationaltime for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutionsfor larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such asbundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutionsfor instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases whereproduct utilities are non-additive.</description><author>Liangyu Ding, Chenghan Wu, Guokai Li, Zizhuo Wang</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 16:39:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22557v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning to Summarize by Learning to Quiz: Adversarial Agentic Collaboration for Long Document Summarization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20900v2</link><description>Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current largelanguage models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle withinformation loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processingexcessively long documents.

The advance of AI coulditself be automated. If done safely, that would accelerate AI development andallow us to reap its benefits much sooner. Meta-learning can automate thediscovery of novel algorithms, but is limited by first-order improvements andthe human design of a suitable search space. The G\"odel machine proposed atheoretical alternative: a self-improving AI that repeatedly modifies itself ina provably beneficial manner. Unfortunately, proving that most changes are netbeneficial is impossible in practice. We introduce the Darwin G\"odel Machine(DGM), a self-improving system that iteratively modifies its own code (therebyalso improving its ability to modify its own codebase) and empiricallyvalidates each change using coding benchmarks. Inspired by Darwinian evolutionand open-endedness research, the DGM maintains an archive of generated codingagents. It grows the archive by sampling an agent from it and using afoundation model to create a new, interesting, version of the sampled agent.This open-ended exploration forms a growing tree of diverse, high-qualityagents and allows the parallel exploration of many different paths through thesearch space. Empirically, the DGM automatically improves its codingcapabilities (e.g., better code editing tools, long-context window management,peer-review mechanisms), increasing performance on SWE-bench from 20.0% to50.0%, and on Polyglot from 14.2% to 30.7%. Furthermore, the DGM significantlyoutperforms baselines without self-improvement or open-ended exploration. Allexperiments were done with safety precautions (e.g., sandboxing, humanoversight). The DGM is a significant step toward self-improving AI, capable ofgathering its own stepping stones along paths that unfold into endlessinnovation.</description><author>Jenny Zhang, Shengran Hu, Cong Lu, Robert Lange, Jeff Clune</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 16:36:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22954v2</guid></item><item><title>Linear Causal Representation Learning by Topological Ordering, Pruning, and Disentanglement</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22553v1</link><description>Causal representation learning (CRL) has garnered increasing interests fromthe causal inference and artificial intelligence community, due to itscapability of disentangling potentially complex data-generating mechanism intocausally interpretable latent features, by leveraging the heterogeneity ofmodern datasets.

Furthermore, we prove that our distances can beconsistently approximated in random graph and random metric space settings viaempirical estimates from generative models. Finally, we demonstrate thepractical utility of our framework through a series of numerical experiments.</description><author>Mario Gómez, Guanqun Ma, Tom Needham, Bei Wang</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 16:31:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22549v1</guid></item><item><title>Self-Supervised Learning of Graph Representations for Network Intrusion Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16625v2</link><description>Detecting intrusions in network traffic is a challenging task, particularlyunder limited supervision and constantly evolving attack patterns. While recentworks have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection,they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limitingthe utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, aself-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages bylearning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through amasked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with itslocal topological context to capture typical network behavior, while aTransformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitlylearning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiringexplicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually highreconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-endframework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstreamtask, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlowbenchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score,outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.</description><author>Lorenzo Guerra, Thomas Chapuis, Guillaume Duc, Pavlo Mozharovskyi, Van-Tam Nguyen</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 16:30:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16625v2</guid></item><item><title>JanusVLN: Decoupling Semantics and Spatiality with Dual Implicit Memory for Vision-Language Navigation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22548v1</link><description>Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate throughunseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuousvideo stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semanticunderstanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methodstypically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitivemaps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers fromspatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, whichimpede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation inhuman navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and theright brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN frameworkfeaturing a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric andvisual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neuralrepresentations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D priorknowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatialreasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, thehistorical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semanticencoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVsof tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate thatJanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. Forexample, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods usingmultiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGBtraining data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, asa novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.Ours project page: https://miv-xjtu.github.io/JanusVLN.github.io/.</description><author>Shuang Zeng, Dekang Qi, Xinyuan Chang, Feng Xiong, Shichao Xie, Xiaolong Wu, Shiyi Liang, Mu Xu, Xing Wei</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 16:29:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22548v1</guid></item><item><title>Capacity-Aware Planning and Scheduling in Budget-Constrained Multi-Agent MDPs: A Meta-RL Approach</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21249v2</link><description>We study capacity- and budget-constrained multi-agent MDPs (CB-MA-MDPs), aclass that captures many maintenance and scheduling tasks in which each agentcan irreversibly fail and a planner must decide (i) when to apply a restorativeaction and (ii) which subset of agents to treat in parallel.

While classical data augmentation cannotcontribute very different new data, diffusion models opens up a new door tobuild self-evolving AI by generating high-quality and diverse synthetic datathrough text-guided prompts. However, text-only guidance cannot controlsynthetic images' proximity to the original images, resulting inout-of-distribution data detrimental to the model performance. To overcome thelimitation, we study image guidance to achieve a spectrum of interpolationsbetween synthetic and real images. With stronger image guidance, the generatedimages are similar to the training data but hard to learn. While with weakerimage guidance, the synthetic images will be easier for model but contribute toa larger distribution gap with the original data. The generated full spectrumof data enables us to build a novel "Diffusion Curriculum (DisCL)". DisCLadjusts the image guidance level of image synthesis for each training stage: Itidentifies and focuses on hard samples for the model and assesses the mosteffective guidance level of synthetic images to improve hard data learning. Weapply DisCL to two challenging tasks: long-tail (LT) classification andlearning from low-quality data. It focuses on lower-guidance images ofhigh-quality to learn prototypical features as a warm-up of learninghigher-guidance images that might be weak on diversity or quality. Extensiveexperiments showcase a gain of 2.7% and 2.1% in OOD and ID macro-accuracy whenapplying DisCL to iWildCam dataset.

In transformers, the wrong initialisationcan lead to one of two failure modes of self-attention layers: rank collapse,where all tokens collapse into similar representations, and entropy collapse,where highly concentrated attention scores lead to training instability. Whileprevious work has studied different scaling regimes for transformers, anasymptotically exact, down-to-the constant prescription for how to initialisetransformers has so far been lacking. Here, we provide an analytical theory ofsignal propagation through deep transformers with self-attention, layernormalisation, skip connections and MLP. Our theory yields a simple algorithmto compute trainability diagrams that identify the correct choice ofinitialisation hyper-parameters for a given architecture. We overcome the keychallenge, an exact treatment of the self-attention layer, by establishing aformal parallel with the Random Energy Model from statistical physics. We alsoanalyse gradients in the backward path and determine the regime where gradientsvanish at initialisation. We demonstrate the versatility of our frameworkthrough three case studies. Our theoretical framework gives a unifiedperspective on the two failure modes of self-attention and gives quantitativepredictions on the scale of both weights and residual connections thatguarantee smooth training.</description><author>Alessio Giorlandino, Sebastian Goldt</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 16:22:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24333v2</guid></item><item><title>Do Data Valuations Make Good Data Prices?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05563v2</link><description>As large language models increasingly rely on external data sources,compensating data contributors has become a central concern. But how shouldthese payments be devised? We revisit data valuations from a$\textit{market-design perspective}$ where payments serve to compensate dataowners for the $\textit{private}$ heterogeneous costs they incur for collectingand sharing data. We show that popular valuation methods-such as Leave-One-Outand Data Shapley-make for poor payments. They fail to ensure truthful reportingof the costs, leading to $\textit{inefficient market}$ outcomes. To addressthis, we adapt well-established payment rules from mechanism design, namelyMyerson and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG), to the data market setting. We showthat Myerson payment is the minimal truthful mechanism, optimal from thebuyer's perspective. Additionally, we identify a condition under which bothdata buyers and sellers are utility-satisfied, and the market achievesefficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating incentivecompatibility into data valuation design, paving the way for more robust andefficient data markets. Our data market framework is readily applicable toreal-world scenarios.

While self-supervised learning (SSL)methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they oftenstruggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, largelanguage models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but arecomputationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grainedspatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video AnomalyDetection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporalanalyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbonewhich is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained withmultiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected ofanomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches theanalysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning tovalidate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVADdataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperformingexisting baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation.

However, most of these policies are trained on datacollected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads topoor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of thesepolicies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressingbuttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilizationproblem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is indistribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set ofcamera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robustto unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouplesnavigation from manipulation and thus does not require additionaldemonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existingefforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints andremains compatible with them. We propose a novel approach for policymobilization that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot'sbase pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Ourapproach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a scorefunction to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization toidentify optimal robot poses. To understand policy mobilization in more depth,we also introduce the Mobi-$\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics thatquantify the difficulty of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulatedmobile manipulation tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization,and (3) visualization tools for analysis.

Understanding the social logics these agentsembody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarilyfocused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking howaltruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emergesin large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce aSchelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict betweenegoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our centralfinding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. Weidentify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default toprioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantlyincrease under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and"Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost tothemselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinningsof these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory tosystematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides thefirst evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistictendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, modelselection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but ofchoosing an intrinsic social action logic.

Our method eliminates the need for large-scalehuman demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents.We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines including GPT-4o as well assupervised fine-tuned MLLMs on our task. Our results show that our RL-finetunedMLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin (10.4-16.5%),generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, thisis the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and askfor help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</description><author>Ram Ramrakhya, Matthew Chang, Xavier Puig, Ruta Desai, Zsolt Kira, Roozbeh Mottaghi</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 16:06:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00907v3</guid></item><item><title>EfficientDepth: A Fast and Detail-Preserving Monocular Depth Estimation Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22527v1</link><description>Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computervision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomousdriving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet keyrequirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometricconsistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflectivesurfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, weintroduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines atransformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as abimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, aswell as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDEmethod. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improvetraining efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency andfine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce aloss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depthmaps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performancecomparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, withsignificantly reduced computational resources.</description><author>Andrii Litvynchuk, Ivan Livinsky, Anand Ravi, Nima Kalantari, Andrii Tsarov</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 16:05:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22527v1</guid></item></channel></rss>
