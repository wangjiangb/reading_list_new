In this work, weanalyze the activations of MAE-VQGAN, a recent Visual Prompting model, and findtask vectors, activations that encode task-specific information. Equipped withthis insight, we demonstrate that it is possible to identify the task vectorsand use them to guide the network towards performing different tasks withoutproviding any input-output examples. To find task vectors, we compute theaverage intermediate activations per task and use the REINFORCE algorithm tosearch for the subset of task vectors. The resulting task vectors guide themodel towards performing a task better than the original model without the needfor input-output examples.</description><author>Alberto Hojel, Yutong Bai, Trevor Darrell, Amir Globerson, Amir Bar</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 18:59:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05729v1</guid></item><item><title>A Large-Scale Exploration of $μ$-Transfer</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05728v1</link><description>Large neural network models have become a mainstay of natural languageprocessing and computer vision, yet their initialization and learning rates areset in a largely heuristic fashion, potentially varying from paper to paper andone model size to the next. The $\mu$-Parameterization ($\mu$P) offers apotential solution to these challenges, yielding scaling rules for modelinitialization and learning rates, and reportedly enabling zero-shothyperparameter transfer from small to large models in a variety of cases. Despite the evident promise, the $\mu$P scaling rules are not yet widelyadopted, perhaps due to higher implementation complexity, many variations, orcomplex theoretical background. This work investigates $\mu$P empirically,focusing on the ubiquitous transformer architecture, and aims to answer asimple question: does $\mu$-Transfer yield optimal learning rates in practice?From models with 2M to 10B parameters, we show that $\mu$-Transfer works asintended for the majority of important cases, but also identify some surprisingcases where it may not.</description><author>Lucas Lingle</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 18:59:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05728v1</guid></item><item><title>MA-LMM: Memory-Augmented Large Multimodal Model for Long-Term Video Understanding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05726v1</link><description>With the success of large language models (LLMs), integrating the visionmodel into LLMs to build vision-language foundation models has gained much moreinterest recently. However, existing LLM-based large multimodal models (e.g.,Video-LLaMA, VideoChat) can only take in a limited number of frames for shortvideo understanding. In this study, we mainly focus on designing an efficientand effective model for long-term video understanding. Instead of trying toprocess more frames simultaneously like most existing work, we propose toprocess videos in an online manner and store past video information in a memorybank. This allows our model to reference historical video content for long-termanalysis without exceeding LLMs' context length constraints or GPU memorylimits. Our memory bank can be seamlessly integrated into current multimodalLLMs in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments on variousvideo understanding tasks, such as long-video understanding, video questionanswering, and video captioning, and our model can achieve state-of-the-artperformances across multiple datasets.

Accordingly, we investigate the detection oftruck overtakes from CAN data. Three classifiers, Artificial Neural Networks(ANN), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are employed for thetask. Our analysis covers up to 10 seconds before the overtaking event, usingan overlapping sliding window of 1 second to extract CAN features. We observethat the prediction scores of the overtake class tend to increase as weapproach the overtake trigger, while the no-overtake class remain stable oroscillates depending on the classifier. Thus, the best accuracy is achievedwhen approaching the trigger, making early overtaking prediction challenging.The classifiers show good accuracy in classifying overtakes (Recall/TPR &gt; 93%),but accuracy is suboptimal in classifying no-overtakes (TNR typically 80-90%and below 60% for one SVM variant). We further combine two classifiers (RandomForest and linear SVM) by averaging their output scores. The fusion is observedto improve no-overtake classification (TNR &gt; 92%) at the expense of reducingovertake accuracy (TPR). However, the latter is kept above 91% near theovertake trigger. Therefore, the fusion balances TPR and TNR, providing moreconsistent performance than individual classifiers.</description><author>Talha Hanif Butt, Prayag Tiwari, Fernando Alonso-Fernandez</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 18:58:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05723v1</guid></item><item><title>Language-Independent Representations Improve Zero-Shot Summarization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05720v1</link><description>Finetuning pretrained models on downstream generation tasks often leads tocatastrophic forgetting in zero-shot conditions. In this work, we focus onsummarization and tackle the problem through the lens of language-independentrepresentations. After training on monolingual summarization, we performzero-shot transfer to new languages or language pairs. We first show naivelyfinetuned models are highly language-specific in both output behavior andinternal representations, resulting in poor zero-shot performance. Next, wepropose query-key (QK) finetuning to decouple task-specific knowledge from thepretrained language generation abilities. Then, after showing downsides of thestandard adversarial language classifier, we propose a balanced variant thatmore directly enforces language-agnostic representations. Moreover, ourqualitative analyses show removing source language identity correlates tozero-shot summarization performance.

Inthis paper, we present Ferret-UI, a new MLLM tailored for enhancedunderstanding of mobile UI screens, equipped with referring, grounding, andreasoning capabilities. Given that UI screens typically exhibit a moreelongated aspect ratio and contain smaller objects of interest (e.g., icons,texts) than natural images, we incorporate "any resolution" on top of Ferret tomagnify details and leverage enhanced visual features. Specifically, eachscreen is divided into 2 sub-images based on the original aspect ratio (i.e.,horizontal division for portrait screens and vertical division for landscapescreens). Both sub-images are encoded separately before being sent to LLMs. Wemeticulously gather training samples from an extensive range of elementary UItasks, such as icon recognition, find text, and widget listing. These samplesare formatted for instruction-following with region annotations to facilitateprecise referring and grounding. To augment the model's reasoning ability, wefurther compile a dataset for advanced tasks, including detailed description,perception/interaction conversations, and function inference. After training onthe curated datasets, Ferret-UI exhibits outstanding comprehension of UIscreens and the capability to execute open-ended instructions. For modelevaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing all theaforementioned tasks. Ferret-UI excels not only beyond most open-source UIMLLMs, but also surpasses GPT-4V on all the elementary UI tasks.</description><author>Keen You, Haotian Zhang, Eldon Schoop, Floris Weers, Amanda Swearngin, Jeffrey Nichols, Yinfei Yang, Zhe Gan</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 18:55:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05719v1</guid></item><item><title>SwapAnything: Enabling Arbitrary Object Swapping in Personalized Visual Editing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05717v1</link><description>Effective editing of personal content holds a pivotal role in enablingindividuals to express their creativity, weaving captivating narratives withintheir visual stories, and elevate the overall quality and impact of theirvisual content. Therefore, in this work, we introduce SwapAnything, a novelframework that can swap any objects in an image with personalized conceptsgiven by the reference, while keeping the context unchanged. Compared withexisting methods for personalized subject swapping, SwapAnything has threeunique advantages: (1) precise control of arbitrary objects and parts ratherthan the main subject, (2) more faithful preservation of context pixels, (3)better adaptation of the personalized concept to the image. First, we proposetargeted variable swapping to apply region control over latent feature maps andswap masked variables for faithful context preservation and initial semanticconcept swapping. Then, we introduce appearance adaptation, to seamlessly adaptthe semantic concept into the original image in terms of target location,shape, style, and content during the image generation process. Extensiveresults on both human and automatic evaluation demonstrate significantimprovements of our approach over baseline methods on personalized swapping.Furthermore, SwapAnything shows its precise and faithful swapping abilitiesacross single object, multiple objects, partial object, and cross-domainswapping tasks. SwapAnything also achieves great performance on text-basedswapping and tasks beyond swapping such as object insertion.</description><author>Jing Gu, Yilin Wang, Nanxuan Zhao, Wei Xiong, Qing Liu, Zhifei Zhang, He Zhang, Jianming Zhang, HyunJoon Jung, Xin Eric Wang</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 18:52:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05717v1</guid></item><item><title>Pre-Sorted Tsetlin Machine (The Genetic K-Medoid Method)</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09680v2</link><description>This paper proposes a machine learning pre-sort stage to traditionalsupervised learning using Tsetlin Machines.

Specifically, VAEs often sufferfrom blurry generated samples due to the lack of a tailored training on thesamples generated in the generative direction. On the other hand, EBMs cangenerate high-quality samples but require expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) sampling. To address these issues, we introduce a conditional EBM forcalibrating the generative direction of VAE during training, without requiringit for the generation at test time. In particular, we train EC-VAE upon boththe input data and the calibrated samples with adaptive weight to enhanceefficacy while avoiding MCMC sampling at test time. Furthermore, we extend thecalibration idea of EC-VAE to variational learning and normalizing flows, andapply EC-VAE to an additional application of zero-shot image restoration vianeural transport prior and range-null theory. We evaluate the proposed methodwith two applications, including image generation and zero-shot imagerestoration, and the experimental results show that our method achievescompetitive performance over single-step non-adversarial generation.

This work targets learning 3D-aware GANs fromunposed images, for which we propose to perform on-the-fly pose estimation oftraining images with a learned template feature field (TeFF). Concretely, inaddition to a generative radiance field as in previous approaches, we ask thegenerator to also learn a field from 2D semantic features while sharing thedensity from the radiance field. Such a framework allows us to acquire acanonical 3D feature template leveraging the dataset mean discovered by thegenerative model, and further efficiently estimate the pose parameters on realdata. Experimental results on various challenging datasets demonstrate thesuperiority of our approach over state-of-the-art alternatives from both thequalitative and the quantitative perspectives.</description><author>Xinya Chen, Hanlei Guo, Yanrui Bin, Shangzhan Zhang, Yuanbo Yang, Yue Wang, Yujun Shen, Yiyi Liao</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 18:42:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05705v1</guid></item><item><title>Humanoid-Gym: Reinforcement Learning for Humanoid Robot with Zero-Shot Sim2Real Transfer</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05695v1</link><description>Humanoid-Gym is an easy-to-use reinforcement learning (RL) framework based onNvidia Isaac Gym, designed to train locomotion skills for humanoid robots,emphasizing zero-shot transfer from simulation to the real-world environment.Humanoid-Gym also integrates a sim-to-sim framework from Isaac Gym to Mujocothat allows users to verify the trained policies in different physicalsimulations to ensure the robustness and generalization of the policies.

While these models demonstrate remarkable performance on generaldatasets, they can struggle in specialized domains such as medicine, whereunique domain-specific terminologies, domain-specific abbreviations, andvarying document structures are common. This paper explores strategies foradapting these models to domain-specific requirements, primarily throughcontinuous pre-training on domain-specific data. We pre-trained several Germanmedical language models on 2.4B tokens derived from translated public Englishmedical data and 3B tokens of German clinical data. The resulting models wereevaluated on various German downstream tasks, including named entityrecognition (NER), multi-label classification, and extractive questionanswering. Our results suggest that models augmented by clinical andtranslation-based pre-training typically outperform general domain models inmedical contexts. We conclude that continuous pre-training has demonstrated theability to match or even exceed the performance of clinical models trained fromscratch. Furthermore, pre-training on clinical data or leveraging translatedtexts have proven to be reliable methods for domain adaptation in medical NLPtasks.</description><author>Ahmad Idrissi-Yaghir, Amin Dada, Henning Schäfer, Kamyar Arzideh, Giulia Baldini, Jan Trienes, Max Hasin, Jeanette Bewersdorff, Cynthia S.

Typically, it relies on semantic segmentation or Land Use LandCover (LULC) classification to categorize each pixel. Despite the advancementsbrought about by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), their performance in segmentationtasks is hindered by challenges such as limited availability of labeled data,class imbalance and the inherent variability and complexity of satelliteimages. In order to mitigate those issues, our study explores the effectivenessof a Cut-and-Paste augmentation technique for semantic segmentation insatellite images. We adapt this augmentation, which usually requires labeledinstances, to the case of semantic segmentation. By leveraging the connectedcomponents in the semantic segmentation labels, we extract instances that arethen randomly pasted during training. Using the DynamicEarthNet dataset and aU-Net model for evaluation, we found that this augmentation significantlyenhances the mIoU score on the test set from 37.9 to 44.1. This findinghighlights the potential of the Cut-and-Paste augmentation to improve thegeneralization capabilities of semantic segmentation models in satelliteimagery.</description><author>Ionut M.

However, the majority of evaluations focus solely onthe final results, neglecting the quality of the intermediate steps. Thisoversight can mask underlying problems, such as logical errors or unnecessarysteps in the reasoning process. To measure reasoning beyond final-answeraccuracy, we introduce ReasonEval, a new methodology for evaluating the qualityof reasoning steps. ReasonEval employs $\textit{validity}$ and$\textit{redundancy}$ to characterize the reasoning quality, as well asaccompanying LLMs to assess them automatically. Instantiated by base modelsthat possess strong mathematical knowledge and trained with high-qualitylabeled data, ReasonEval achieves state-of-the-art performance on human-labeleddatasets and can accurately detect different types of errors generated byperturbation. When applied to evaluate LLMs specialized in math, we find thatan increase in final-answer accuracy does not necessarily guarantee animprovement in the overall quality of the reasoning steps for challengingmathematical problems. Additionally, we observe that ReasonEval can play asignificant role in data selection.

The laws discovered underexperimental paradigms are controversial and lack generalizability. This paperaims to unearth the laws of skill learning from large-scale training log data.A two-stage algorithm was developed to tackle the issues of unobservablecognitive states and algorithmic explosion in searching. Initially a deeplearning model is employed to determine the learner's cognitive state andassess the feature importance. Subsequently, symbolic regression algorithms areutilized to parse the neural network model into algebraic equations. Theexperimental results of simulated data demonstrate that the proposed algorithmcan accurately restore various preset laws within a certain range of noise, incontinues feedback setting. Application of proposed method to Lumosity trainingdata demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional and latestmodels in terms of fitness. The results indicate the discovery of two new formsof skill acquisition laws, while some previous findings have been reaffirmed.</description><author>Sannyuya Liu, Qing Li, Xiaoxuan Shen, Jianwen Sun, Zongkai Yang</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 18:15:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05689v1</guid></item><item><title>David and Goliath: An Empirical Evaluation of Attacks and Defenses for QNNs at the Deep Edge</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05688v1</link><description>ML is shifting from the cloud to the edge. Edge computing reduces the surfaceexposing private data and enables reliable throughput guarantees in real-timeapplications. Of the panoply of devices deployed at the edge,resource-constrained MCUs, e.g., Arm Cortex-M, are more prevalent, orders ofmagnitude cheaper, and less power-hungry than application processors or GPUs.Thus, enabling intelligence at the deep edge is the zeitgeist, with researchersfocusing on unveiling novel approaches to deploy ANNs on these constraineddevices. Quantization is a well-established technique that has proved effectivein enabling the deployment of neural networks on MCUs; however, it is still anopen question to understand the robustness of QNNs in the face of adversarialexamples. To fill this gap, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of attacks anddefenses from (full-precision) ANNs on (constrained) QNNs. Our evaluationincludes three QNNs targeting TinyML applications, ten attacks, and sixdefenses. With this study, we draw a set of interesting findings. First,quantization increases the point distance to the decision boundary and leadsthe gradient estimated by some attacks to explode or vanish. Second,quantization can act as a noise attenuator or amplifier, depending on the noisemagnitude, and causes gradient misalignment. Regarding adversarial defenses, weconclude that input pre-processing defenses show impressive results on smallperturbations; however, they fall short as the perturbation increases. At thesame time, train-based defenses increase the average point distance to thedecision boundary, which holds after quantization. However, we argue thattrain-based defenses still need to smooth the quantization-shift and gradientmisalignment phenomenons to counteract adversarial example transferability toQNNs. All artifacts are open-sourced to enable independent validation ofresults.</description><author>Miguel Costa, Sandro Pinto</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 18:14:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05688v1</guid></item><item><title>Retrieval-Augmented Open-Vocabulary Object Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05687v1</link><description>Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) has been studied with Vision-LanguageModels (VLMs) to detect novel objects beyond the pre-trained categories.Previous approaches improve the generalization ability to expand the knowledgeof the detector, using 'positive' pseudo-labels with additional 'class' names,e.g., sock, iPod, and alligator. To extend the previous methods in two aspects,we propose Retrieval-Augmented Losses and visual Features (RALF). Our methodretrieves related 'negative' classes and augments loss functions. Also, visualfeatures are augmented with 'verbalized concepts' of classes, e.g., worn on thefeet, handheld music player, and sharp teeth. Specifically, RALF consists oftwo modules: Retrieval Augmented Losses (RAL) and Retrieval-Augmented visualFeatures (RAF). RAL constitutes two losses reflecting the semantic similaritywith negative vocabularies. In addition, RAF augments visual features with theverbalized concepts from a large language model (LLM).

Although PanoHead proves the possibilities of using a large-scaledataset with images of both frontal and back views for full-head synthesis, itoften causes artifacts for back views. Based on our in-depth analysis, we foundthe reasons are mainly twofold. First, from network architecture perspective,we found each plane in the utilized tri-plane/tri-grid representation spacetends to confuse the features from both sides, causing "mirroring" artifacts(e.g., the glasses appear in the back). Second, from data supervision aspect,we found that existing discriminator training in 3D GANs mainly focuses on thequality of the rendered image itself, and does not care much about itsplausibility with the perspective from which it was rendered. This makes itpossible to generate "face" in non-frontal views, due to its easiness to foolthe discriminator. In response, we propose SphereHead, a novel tri-planerepresentation in the spherical coordinate system that fits the human head'sgeometric characteristics and efficiently mitigates many of the generatedartifacts. We further introduce a view-image consistency loss for thediscriminator to emphasize the correspondence of the camera parameters and theimages. The combination of these efforts results in visually superior outcomeswith significantly fewer artifacts.

Yet, in many cases there is value in training a network justfrom the input at hand. This is particularly relevant in many signal and imageprocessing problems where training data is scarce and diversity is large on theone hand, and on the other, there is a lot of structure in the data that can beexploited. Using this information is the key to deep internal-learningstrategies, which may involve training a network from scratch using a singleinput or adapting an already trained network to a provided input example atinference time. This survey paper aims at covering deep internal-learningtechniques that have been proposed in the past few years for these twoimportant directions. While our main focus will be on image processingproblems, most of the approaches that we survey are derived for general signals(vectors with recurring patterns that can be distinguished from noise) and aretherefore applicable to other modalities.</description><author>Tom Tirer, Raja Giryes, Se Young Chun, Yonina C.

Probabilistic models of the human pose can benefit fromapproaches that rigorously consider the rotational nature of human joints. Forthis purpose, we introduce HuProSO3, a normalizing flow model that operates ona high-dimensional product space of SO(3) manifolds, modeling the jointdistribution for human joints with three degrees of freedom. HuProSO3'sadvantage over state-of-the-art approaches is demonstrated through its superiormodeling accuracy in three different applications and its capability toevaluate the exact likelihood. This work not only addresses the technicalchallenge of learning densities on SO(3) manifolds, but it also has broaderimplications for domains where the probabilistic regression of correlated 3Drotations is of importance.</description><author>Olaf Dünkel, Tim Salzmann, Florian Pfaff</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 17:56:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05675v1</guid></item><item><title>MoMA: Multimodal LLM Adapter for Fast Personalized Image Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05674v1</link><description>In this paper, we present MoMA: an open-vocabulary, training-freepersonalized image model that boasts flexible zero-shot capabilities. Asfoundational text-to-image models rapidly evolve, the demand for robustimage-to-image translation grows. Addressing this need, MoMA specializes insubject-driven personalized image generation. Utilizing an open-source,Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), we train MoMA to serve a dual role asboth a feature extractor and a generator. This approach effectively synergizesreference image and text prompt information to produce valuable image features,facilitating an image diffusion model. To better leverage the generatedfeatures, we further introduce a novel self-attention shortcut method thatefficiently transfers image features to an image diffusion model, improving theresemblance of the target object in generated images. Remarkably, as atuning-free plug-and-play module, our model requires only a single referenceimage and outperforms existing methods in generating images with high detailfidelity, enhanced identity-preservation and prompt faithfulness. Our work isopen-source, thereby providing universal access to these advancements.</description><author>Kunpeng Song, Yizhe Zhu, Bingchen Liu, Qing Yan, Ahmed Elgammal, Xiao Yang</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 17:55:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05674v1</guid></item><item><title>CoReS: Orchestrating the Dance of Reasoning and Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05673v1</link><description>The reasoning segmentation task, which demands a nuanced comprehension ofintricate queries to accurately pinpoint object regions, is attractingincreasing attention. However, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM) oftenfind it difficult to accurately localize the objects described in complexreasoning contexts. We believe that the act of reasoning segmentation shouldmirror the cognitive stages of human visual search, where each step is aprogressive refinement of thought toward the final object. Thus we introducethe Chains of Reasoning and Segmenting (CoReS) and find this top-down visualhierarchy indeed enhances the visual search process. Specifically, we propose adual-chain structure that generates multi-modal, chain-like outputs to aid thesegmentation process. Furthermore, to steer the MLLM's outputs into thisintended hierarchy, we incorporate in-context inputs as guidance. Extensiveexperiments demonstrate the superior performance of our CoReS, which surpassesthe state-of-the-art method by 7.1\% on the ReasonSeg dataset.

Therefore, acrucial preprocessing step is essential to eliminate noise while preservingtext and key features of documents. In this paper, we propose NAF-DPM, a novelgenerative framework based on a diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) designed torestore the original quality of degraded documents. While DPMs are recognizedfor their high-quality generated images, they are also known for their largeinference time. To mitigate this problem we provide the DPM with an efficientnonlinear activation-free (NAF) network and we employ as a sampler a fastsolver of ordinary differential equations, which can converge in a fewiterations. To better preserve text characters, we introduce an additionaldifferentiable module based on convolutional recurrent neural networks,simulating the behavior of an OCR system during training. Experiments conductedon various datasets showcase the superiority of our approach, achievingstate-of-the-art performance in terms of pixel-level and perceptual similaritymetrics.

This issue becomes moresignificant in zero-shot image segmentation because the stronger (i.e.,pixel-level) supervision brings a larger gap between seen and unseen classes.To mitigate it, we propose a novel architecture named AlignZeg, which embodiesa comprehensive improvement of the segmentation pipeline, including proposalextraction, classification, and correction, to better fit the goal of zero-shotsegmentation. (1) Mutually-Refined Proposal Extraction. AlignZeg harnesses amutual interaction between mask queries and visual features, facilitatingdetailed class-agnostic mask proposal extraction. (2) Generalization-EnhancedProposal Classification. AlignZeg introduces synthetic data and incorporatesmultiple background prototypes to allocate a more generalizable feature space.(3) Predictive Bias Correction. During the inference stage, AlignZeg uses aclass indicator to find potential unseen class proposals followed by aprediction postprocess to correct the prediction bias. Experiments demonstratethat AlignZeg markedly enhances zero-shot semantic segmentation, as shown by anaverage 3.8% increase in hIoU, primarily attributed to a 7.1% improvement inidentifying unseen classes, and we further validate that the improvement comesfrom alleviating the objective misalignment issue.</description><author>Jiannan Ge, Lingxi Xie, Hongtao Xie, Pandeng Li, Xiaopeng Zhang, Yongdong Zhang, Qi Tian</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 17:51:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05667v1</guid></item><item><title>YaART: Yet Another ART Rendering Technology</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05666v1</link><description>In the rapidly progressing field of generative models, the development ofefficient and high-fidelity text-to-image diffusion systems represents asignificant frontier.

In this paper, wepropose BinaryDM, a novel accurate quantization-aware training approach to pushthe weights of diffusion models towards the limit of 1-bit. Firstly, we presenta Learnable Multi-basis Binarizer (LMB) to recover the representationsgenerated by the binarized DM, which improves the information in details ofrepresentations crucial to the DM. Secondly, a Low-rank RepresentationMimicking (LRM) is applied to enhance the binarization-aware optimization ofthe DM, alleviating the optimization direction ambiguity caused by fine-grainedalignment. Moreover, a progressive initialization strategy is applied totraining DMs to avoid convergence difficulties. Comprehensive experimentsdemonstrate that BinaryDM achieves significant accuracy and efficiency gainscompared to SOTA quantization methods of DMs under ultra-low bit-widths. As thefirst binarization method for diffusion models, BinaryDM achieves impressive16.0 times FLOPs and 27.1 times storage savings with 1-bit weight and 4-bitactivation, showcasing its substantial advantages and potential for deployingDMs on resource-limited scenarios.</description><author>Xingyu Zheng, Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Mingyuan Zhang, Haojie Hao, Jiakai Wang, Zixiang Zhao, Jinyang Guo, Xianglong Liu</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 17:46:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05662v1</guid></item><item><title>Automatic Controllable Colorization via Imagination</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05661v1</link><description>We propose a framework for automatic colorization that allows for iterativeediting and modifications.

Previous token pruning works motivate theirmethods from the view of computation redundancy but still need to load the fullnetwork and require same memory costs. This paper introduces a novel strategythat simplifies vision transformers and reduces computational load through theselective removal of non-essential attention layers, guided by entropyconsiderations. We identify that regarding the attention layer in bottomblocks, their subsequent MLP layers, i.e. two feed-forward layers, can elicitthe same entropy quantity. Meanwhile, the accompanied MLPs are under-exploitedsince they exhibit smaller feature entropy compared to those MLPs in the topblocks. Therefore, we propose to integrate the uninformative attention layersinto their subsequent counterparts by degenerating them into identical mapping,yielding only MLP in certain transformer blocks. Experimental results onImageNet-1k show that the proposed method can remove 40% attention layer ofDeiT-B, improving throughput and memory bound without performance compromise.Code is available at https://github.com/sihaoevery/lambda_vit.</description><author>Sihao Lin, Pumeng Lyu, Dongrui Liu, Tao Tang, Xiaodan Liang, Andy Song, Xiaojun Chang</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 17:40:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05657v1</guid></item><item><title>Causality Extraction from Nuclear Licensee Event Reports Using a Hybrid Framework</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05656v1</link><description>Industry-wide nuclear power plant operating experience is a critical sourceof raw data for performing parameter estimations in reliability and riskmodels.

In this paper, we studythe transferability of TSP via a generalized higher-order version of graphon,known as complexon. We recall the notion of a complexon as the limit of asimplicial complex sequence [1]. Inspired by the graphon shift operator andmessage-passing neural network, we construct a marginal complexon and complexonshift operator (CSO) according to components of all possible dimensions fromthe complexon. We investigate the CSO's eigenvalues and eigenvectors and relatethem to a new family of weighted adjacency matrices. We prove that when asimplicial complex signal sequence converges to a complexon signal, theeigenvalues, eigenspaces, and Fourier transform of the corresponding CSOsconverge to that of the limit complexon signal. This conclusion is furtherverified by two numerical experiments. These results hint at learningtransferability on large simplicial complexes or simplicial complex sequences,which generalize the graphon signal processing framework.</description><author>Purui Zhang, Xingchao Jian, Feng Ji, Wee Peng Tay, Bihan Wen</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 17:37:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07169v3</guid></item><item><title>Resistive Memory-based Neural Differential Equation Solver for Score-based Diffusion Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05648v1</link><description>Human brains image complicated scenes when reading a novel. Replicating thisimagination is one of the ultimate goals of AI-Generated Content (AIGC).However, current AIGC methods, such as score-based diffusion, are stilldeficient in terms of rapidity and efficiency. This deficiency is rooted in thedifference between the brain and digital computers. Digital computers havephysically separated storage and processing units, resulting in frequent datatransfers during iterative calculations, incurring large time and energyoverheads. This issue is further intensified by the conversion of inherentlycontinuous and analog generation dynamics, which can be formulated by neuraldifferential equations, into discrete and digital operations. Inspired by thebrain, we propose a time-continuous and analog in-memory neural differentialequation solver for score-based diffusion, employing emerging resistive memory.The integration of storage and computation within resistive memory synapsessurmount the von Neumann bottleneck, benefiting the generative speed and energyefficiency. The closed-loop feedback integrator is time-continuous, analog, andcompact, physically implementing an infinite-depth neural network. Moreover,the software-hardware co-design is intrinsically robust to analog noise. Weexperimentally validate our solution with 180 nm resistive memory in-memorycomputing macros. Demonstrating equivalent generative quality to the softwarebaseline, our system achieved remarkable enhancements in generative speed forboth unconditional and conditional generation tasks, by factors of 64.8 and156.5, respectively.

Previous works alwaysrequire thousands of object images with annotated poses for learning the 3Dpose correspondence, which is laborious and time-consuming for labeling. Inthis paper, we propose to learn a category-level 3D object pose estimatorwithout pose annotations. Instead of using manually annotated images, weleverage diffusion models (e.g., Zero-1-to-3) to generate a set of images undercontrolled pose differences and propose to learn our object pose estimator withthose images. Directly using the original diffusion model leads to images withnoisy poses and artifacts. To tackle this issue, firstly, we exploit an imageencoder, which is learned from a specially designed contrastive pose learning,to filter the unreasonable details and extract image feature maps.Additionally, we propose a novel learning strategy that allows the model tolearn object poses from those generated image sets without knowing thealignment of their canonical poses. Experimental results show that our methodhas the capability of category-level object pose estimation from a single shotsetting (as pose definition), while significantly outperforming otherstate-of-the-art methods on the few-shot category-level object pose estimationbenchmarks.</description><author>Fengrui Tian, Yaoyao Liu, Adam Kortylewski, Yueqi Duan, Shaoyi Du, Alan Yuille, Angtian Wang</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 16:59:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05626v1</guid></item><item><title>Deep Feature Statistics Mapping for Generalized Screen Content Image Quality Assessment</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05321v3</link><description>The statistical regularities of natural images, referred to as natural scenestatistics, play an important role in no-reference image quality assessment.However, it has been widely acknowledged that screen content images (SCIs),which are typically computer generated, do not hold such statistics.

Gathering a large pool of unlabelleddata is thus essential to capture minority instances. Standard pool-basedactive learning is computationally expensive on large pools and often reacheslow accuracy by overfitting the initial decision boundary, thus failing toexplore the input space and find minority instances. To address these issues wepropose AnchorAL. At each iteration, AnchorAL chooses class-specific instancesfrom the labelled set, or anchors, and retrieves the most similar unlabelledinstances from the pool. This resulting subpool is then used for activelearning. Using a small, fixed-sized subpool AnchorAL allows scaling any activelearning strategy to large pools. By dynamically selecting different anchors ateach iteration it promotes class balance and prevents overfitting the initialdecision boundary, thus promoting the discovery of new clusters of minorityinstances. Experiments across different classification tasks, active learningstrategies, and model architectures AnchorAL is (i) faster, often reducingruntime from hours to minutes, (ii) trains more performant models, (iii) andreturns more balanced datasets than competing methods.</description><author>Pietro Lesci, Andreas Vlachos</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 16:53:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05623v1</guid></item><item><title>How to Evaluate Entity Resolution Systems: An Entity-Centric Framework with Application to Inventor Name Disambiguation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05622v1</link><description>Entity resolution (record linkage, microclustering) systems are notoriouslydifficult to evaluate.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Traffic FlowPrediction LLM (TF-LLM), which leverages large language models (LLMs) togenerate interpretable traffic flow predictions. By transferring multi-modaltraffic data into natural language descriptions, TF-LLM captures complexspatial-temporal patterns and external factors such as weather conditions,Points of Interest (PoIs), date, and holidays. We fine-tune the LLM frameworkusing language-based instructions to align with spatial-temporal traffic flowdata. Our comprehensive multi-modal traffic flow dataset (CATraffic) inCalifornia enables the evaluation of TF-LLM against state-of-the-art deeplearning baselines.

To addressthis issue, removing parameters via model pruning is a viable solution.However, existing techniques for VLMs are task-specific, and thus requirepruning the network from scratch for each new task of interest. In this work,we explore a new direction: Task-Agnostic Vision-Language Pruning (TA-VLP).Given a pretrained VLM, the goal is to find a unique pruned counterparttransferable to multiple unknown downstream tasks. In this challenging setting,the transferable representations already encoded in the pretrained model are akey aspect to preserve. Thus, we propose Multimodal Flow Pruning (MULTIFLOW), afirst, gradient-free, pruning framework for TA-VLP where: (i) the importance ofa parameter is expressed in terms of its magnitude and its information flow, byincorporating the saliency of the neurons it connects; and (ii) pruning isdriven by the emergent (multimodal) distribution of the VLM parameters afterpretraining. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art pruning algorithms in thecontext of TA-VLP, experimenting with two VLMs, three vision-language tasks,and three pruning ratios. Our experimental results show that MULTIFLOWoutperforms recent sophisticated, combinatorial competitors in the vastmajority of the cases, paving the way towards addressing TA-VLP.

In this paper, we propose a new model based on Transformer thatsimultaneously deals with the real time 3D human motion forecasting in theshort and long term. Our 2-Channel Transformer (2CH-TR) is able to efficientlyexploit the spatio-temporal information of a shortly observed sequence (400ms)and generates a competitive accuracy against the current state-of-the-art.2CH-TR stands out for the efficient performance of the Transformer, beinglighter and faster than its competitors.

Recentworks focus on exploring the structural rationale from graphs, therebyincreasing the discriminability of the invariant information. However, suchmethods may incur in the mis-learning of graph models towards theinterpretability of graphs, and thus the learned noisy and task-agnosticinformation interferes with the prediction of graphs. To this end, with thepurpose of exploring the intrinsic rationale of graphs, we accordingly proposeto capture the dimensional rationale from graphs, which has not receivedsufficient attention in the literature. The conducted exploratory experimentsattest to the feasibility of the aforementioned roadmap. To elucidate theinnate mechanism behind the performance improvement arising from thedimensional rationale, we rethink the dimensional rationale in graphcontrastive learning from a causal perspective and further formalize thecausality among the variables in the pre-training stage to build thecorresponding structural causal model. On the basis of the understanding of thestructural causal model, we propose the dimensional rationale-aware graphcontrastive learning approach, which introduces a learnable dimensionalrationale acquiring network and a redundancy reduction constraint. Thelearnable dimensional rationale acquiring network is updated by leveraging abi-level meta-learning technique, and the redundancy reduction constraintdisentangles the redundant features through a decorrelation process duringlearning.

However, for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we find thatsimply partitioning without altering their structures can hardly achieve thefull potential of the co-inference paradigm due to variouscomputational-communication overheads of GNN operations over heterogeneousdevices. We present GCoDE, the first automatic framework for GNN thatinnovatively Co-designs the architecture search and the mapping of eachoperation on Device-Edge hierarchies. GCoDE abstracts the device communicationprocess into an explicit operation and fuses the search of architecture and theoperations mapping in a unified space for joint-optimization.

However, different granularities of text,such as characters, subwords, and words, can contain different kinds ofinformation. Previous studies have shown that incorporating multiple inputgranularities improves model generalization, yet very few of them outputsuseful representations for each granularity. In this paper, we introduce theentanglement model, aiming to combine character and subword language models.Inspired by vision-language models, our model treats characters and subwords asseparate modalities, and it generates mutually informed representations forboth granularities as output. We evaluate our model on text classification,named entity recognition, POS-tagging, and character-level sequence labeling(intraword code-switching). Notably, the entanglement model outperforms itsbackbone language models, particularly in the presence of noisy texts andlow-resource languages. Furthermore, the entanglement model even outperformslarger pre-trained models on all English sequence labeling tasks andclassification tasks.

This paper addresses this gap by first analyzing thedistribution gap in codec language models, highlighting how it leads todiscrepancies between the training and inference phases, which negativelyaffects performance. Then we explore leveraging learning from human feedback tobridge the distribution gap. We introduce SpeechAlign, an iterativeself-improvement strategy that aligns speech language models to humanpreferences. SpeechAlign involves constructing a preference codec datasetcontrasting golden codec tokens against synthetic tokens, followed bypreference optimization to improve the codec language model. This cycle ofimprovement is carried out iteratively to steadily convert weak models tostrong ones.

Unlike CNN-based models, Transformersare more adept at capturing long-range dependencies, enabling thereconstruction of images utilizing information from non-local areas. In thedomain of super-resolution, Swin-transformer-based approaches have becomemainstream due to their capacity to capture global spatial information andtheir shifting-window attention mechanism that facilitates the interchange ofinformation between different windows. Many researchers have enhanced imagequality and network efficiency by expanding the receptive field or designingcomplex networks, yielding commendable results.

However, while impressive, the required quality barfor medical applications remains far from being achieved. Currently, LLMsremain challenged by outdated knowledge and by their tendency to generatehallucinated content. Furthermore, most benchmarks to assess medical knowledgelack reference gold explanations which means that it is not possible toevaluate the reasoning of LLMs predictions. Finally, the situation isparticularly grim if we consider benchmarking LLMs for languages other thanEnglish which remains, as far as we know, a totally neglected topic. In orderto address these shortcomings, in this paper we present MedExpQA, the firstmultilingual benchmark based on medical exams to evaluate LLMs in MedicalQuestion Answering. To the best of our knowledge, MedExpQA includes for thefirst time reference gold explanations written by medical doctors which can beleveraged to establish various gold-based upper-bounds for comparison with LLMsperformance. Comprehensive multilingual experimentation using both the goldreference explanations and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches showthat performance of LLMs still has large room for improvement, especially forlanguages other than English. Furthermore, and despite using state-of-the-artRAG methods, our results also demonstrate the difficulty of obtaining andintegrating readily available medical knowledge that may positively impactresults on downstream evaluations for Medical Question Answering. So far thebenchmark is available in four languages, but we hope that this work mayencourage further development to other languages.</description><author>Iñigo Alonso, Maite Oronoz, Rodrigo Agerri</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 16:03:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05590v1</guid></item><item><title>Towards an end-to-end artificial intelligence driven global weather forecasting system</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12462v3</link><description>The weather forecasting system is important for science and society, andsignificant achievements have been made in applying artificial intelligence(AI) to medium-range weather forecasting.

Initial states are typically generated by traditional dataassimilation components, which are computational expensive and time-consuming.Here we present an AI-based data assimilation model, i.e., Adas, for globalweather variables. By introducing the confidence matrix, Adas employs gatedconvolution to handle sparse observations and gated cross-attention forcapturing the interactions between the background and observations. Further, wecombine Adas with the advanced AI-based forecasting model (i.e., FengWu) toconstruct the first end-to-end AI-based global weather forecasting system:FengWu-Adas. We demonstrate that Adas can assimilate global observations toproduce high-quality analysis, enabling the system operate stably for longterm.

The research on transforming harmful images intoresponsible ones remains unexplored. In this paper, we formulate a new task,responsible visual editing, which entails modifying specific concepts within animage to render it more responsible while minimizing changes. However, theconcept that needs to be edited is often abstract, making it challenging tolocate what needs to be modified and plan how to modify it. To tackle thesechallenges, we propose a Cognitive Editor (CoEditor) that harnesses the largemultimodal model through a two-stage cognitive process: (1) a perceptualcognitive process to focus on what needs to be modified and (2) a behavioralcognitive process to strategize how to modify. To mitigate the negativeimplications of harmful images on research, we create a transparent and publicdataset, AltBear, which expresses harmful information using teddy bears insteadof humans. Experiments demonstrate that CoEditor can effectively comprehendabstract concepts within complex scenes and significantly surpass theperformance of baseline models for responsible visual editing. We find that theAltBear dataset corresponds well to the harmful content found in real images,offering a consistent experimental evaluation, thereby providing a saferbenchmark for future research.

Additionally, we propose aframework for evaluating factual recall in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)systems, which we employ to compare prompt-based and FaaF methods using variousLMs under challenging conditions.</description><author>Vasileios Katranidis, Gabor Barany</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 15:49:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03888v2</guid></item><item><title>Fact-Checking Generative AI: Ontology-Driven Biological Graphs for Disease-Gene Link Verification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03929v4</link><description>Since the launch of various generative AI tools, scientists have beenstriving to evaluate their capabilities and contents, in the hope ofestablishing trust in their generative abilities.

Recent works focus on optimizing the agent team oremploying self-reflection to iteratively solve complex tasks. Since theseagents are all based on the same LLM, only conducting self-evaluation orremoving underperforming agents does not substantively enhance the capabilityof the agents. We argue that a comprehensive evaluation and accumulatingexperience from evaluation feedback is an effective approach to improvingsystem performance. In this paper, we propose Reusable Experience Accumulationwith 360{\deg} Assessment (360{\deg}REA), a hierarchical multi-agent frameworkinspired by corporate organizational practices. The framework employs a novel360{\deg} performance assessment method for multi-perspective performanceevaluation with fine-grained assessment. To enhance the capability of agents inaddressing complex tasks, we introduce dual-level experience pool for agents toaccumulate experience through fine-grained assessment. Extensive experiments oncomplex task datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of 360{\deg}REA.</description><author>Shen Gao, Hao Li, Zhengliang Shi, Chengrui Huang, Quan Tu, Zhiliang Tian, Minlie Huang, Shuo Shang</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 15:43:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05569v1</guid></item><item><title>MESA: Matching Everything by Segmenting Anything</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16741v2</link><description>Feature matching is a crucial task in the field of computer vision, whichinvolves finding correspondences between images. Previous studies achieveremarkable performance using learning-based feature comparison. However, thepervasive presence of matching redundancy between images gives rise tounnecessary and error-prone computations in these methods, imposing limitationson their accuracy. To address this issue, we propose MESA, a novel approach toestablish precise area (or region) matches for efficient matching redundancyreduction. MESA first leverages the advanced image understanding capability ofSAM, a state-of-the-art foundation model for image segmentation, to obtainimage areas with implicit semantic. Then, a multi-relational graph is proposedto model the spatial structure of these areas and construct their scalehierarchy. Based on graphical models derived from the graph, the area matchingis reformulated as an energy minimization task and effectively resolved.Extensive experiments demonstrate that MESA yields substantial precisionimprovement for multiple point matchers in indoor and outdoor downstream tasks,e.g. +13.61% for DKM in indoor pose estimation.</description><author>Yesheng Zhang, Xu Zhao</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 15:42:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16741v2</guid></item><item><title>Dense Training, Sparse Inference: Rethinking Training of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05567v1</link><description>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models can reduce computational costs by2-4$\times$ compared to dense models without sacrificing performance, makingthem more efficient in computation-bounded scenarios. However, MoE modelsgenerally require 2-4$\times$ times more parameters to achieve comparableperformance to a dense model, which incurs larger GPU memory requirements andmakes MoE models less efficient in I/O-bounded scenarios like autoregressivegeneration. In this work, we propose a hybrid dense training and sparseinference framework for MoE models (DS-MoE) which achieves strong computationand parameter efficiency by employing dense computation across all expertsduring training and sparse computation during inference. Our experiments ontraining LLMs demonstrate that our DS-MoE models are more parameter-efficientthan standard sparse MoEs and are on par with dense models in terms of totalparameter size and performance while being computationally cheaper (activating30-40% of the model's parameters). Performance tests using vLLM show that ourDS-MoE-6B model runs up to $1.86\times$ faster than similar dense models likeMistral-7B, and between $1.50\times$ and $1.71\times$ faster than comparableMoEs, such as DeepSeekMoE-16B and Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B.</description><author>Bowen Pan, Yikang Shen, Haokun Liu, Mayank Mishra, Gaoyuan Zhang, Aude Oliva, Colin Raffel, Rameswar Panda</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 15:39:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05567v1</guid></item><item><title>DPHMs: Diffusion Parametric Head Models for Depth-based Tracking</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01068v2</link><description>We introduce Diffusion Parametric Head Models (DPHMs), a generative modelthat enables robust volumetric head reconstruction and tracking from monoculardepth sequences. While recent volumetric head models, such as NPHMs, can nowexcel in representing high-fidelity head geometries, tracking andreconstructing heads from real-world single-view depth sequences remains verychallenging, as the fitting to partial and noisy observations isunderconstrained. To tackle these challenges, we propose a latentdiffusion-based prior to regularize volumetric head reconstruction andtracking. This prior-based regularizer effectively constrains the identity andexpression codes to lie on the underlying latent manifold which representsplausible head shapes. To evaluate the effectiveness of the diffusion-basedprior, we collect a dataset of monocular Kinect sequences consisting of variouscomplex facial expression motions and rapid transitions.

Although current pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achievedsubstantial gains on these tasks, they rarely explicitly incorporate boundaryinformation into the modeling process. An exception to this is BABERT, whichincorporates unsupervised statistical boundary information into Chinese BERT'spre-training objectives. Building upon this approach, we input supervisedhigh-quality boundary information to enhance BABERT's learning, developing asemi-supervised boundary-aware PLM. To assess PLMs' ability to encodeboundaries, we introduce a novel ``Boundary Information Metric'' that is bothsimple and effective. This metric allows comparison of different PLMs withouttask-specific fine-tuning. Experimental results on Chinese sequence labelingdatasets demonstrate that the improved BABERT variant outperforms the vanillaversion, not only on these tasks but also more broadly across a range ofChinese natural language understanding tasks.

Recentworks showcase that the two modalities of audio and video exhibit differenttemporal extents of events and distinct labels. We address the interplaybetween the two modalities in long videos by explicitly modelling the temporalextents of audio and visual events. We propose the Time Interval Machine (TIM)where a modality-specific time interval poses as a query to a transformerencoder that ingests a long video input. The encoder then attends to thespecified interval, as well as the surrounding context in both modalities, inorder to recognise the ongoing action. We test TIM on three long audio-visual video datasets: EPIC-KITCHENS,Perception Test, and AVE, reporting state-of-the-art (SOTA) for recognition. OnEPIC-KITCHENS, we beat previous SOTA that utilises LLMs and significantlylarger pre-training by 2.9% top-1 action recognition accuracy. Additionally, weshow that TIM can be adapted for action detection, using dense multi-scaleinterval queries, outperforming SOTA on EPIC-KITCHENS-100 for most metrics, andshowing strong performance on the Perception Test. Our ablations show thecritical role of integrating the two modalities and modelling their timeintervals in achieving this performance.

In this paper, we provide a convergence analysis ofmemory-based continual learning with stochastic gradient descent and empiricalevidence that training current tasks causes the cumulative degradation ofprevious tasks. We propose an adaptive method for nonconvex continual learning(NCCL), which adjusts step sizes of both previous and current tasks with thegradients.

To do so,these methods separate the latent space into a set of salient features (i.e.,proper to the target dataset) and a set of common features (i.e., exist in bothdatasets). Currently, all models fail to prevent the sharing of informationbetween latent spaces effectively and to capture all salient factors ofvariation. To this end, we introduce two crucial regularization losses: adisentangling term between common and salient representations and aclassification term between background and target samples in the salient space.We show a better performance than previous CA-VAEs methods on three medicalapplications and a natural images dataset (CelebA).

As practitioners consider usinglarge language models (LLMs) to automate decisions, studying their causalreasoning capabilities becomes crucial. A recent line of work evaluates LLMsability to retrieve commonsense causal facts, but these evaluations do notsufficiently assess how LLMs reason about interventions. Motivated by the rolethat interventions play in causal inference, in this paper, we conductempirical analyses to evaluate whether LLMs can accurately update theirknowledge of a data-generating process in response to an intervention. Wecreate benchmarks that span diverse causal graphs (e.g., confounding,mediation) and variable types, and enable a study of intervention-basedreasoning. These benchmarks allow us to isolate the ability of LLMs toaccurately predict changes resulting from their ability to memorize facts orfind other shortcuts. Our analysis on four LLMs highlights that while GPT- 4models show promising accuracy at predicting the intervention effects, theyremain sensitive to distracting factors in the prompts.</description><author>Tejas Kasetty, Divyat Mahajan, Gintare Karolina Dziugaite, Alexandre Drouin, Dhanya Sridhar</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 15:15:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05545v1</guid></item><item><title>Stitching Satellites to the Edge: Pervasive and Efficient Federated LEO Satellite Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15541v2</link><description>In the ambitious realm of space AI, the integration of federated learning(FL) with low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations holds immense promise.However, many challenges persist in terms of feasibility, learning efficiency,and convergence. These hurdles stem from the bottleneck in communication,characterized by sporadic and irregular connectivity between LEO satellites andground stations, coupled with the limited computation capability of satelliteedge computing (SEC). This paper proposes a novel FL-SEC framework thatempowers LEO satellites to execute large-scale machine learning (ML) tasksonboard efficiently. Its key components include i) personalized learning viadivide-and-conquer, which identifies and eliminates redundant satellite imagesand converts complex multi-class classification problems to simple binaryclassification, enabling rapid and energy-efficient training of lightweight MLmodels suitable for IoT/edge devices on satellites; ii) orbital modelretraining, which generates an aggregated "orbital model" per orbit andretrains it before sending to the ground station, significantly reducing therequired communication rounds. We conducted experiments using Jetson Nano, anedge device closely mimicking the limited compute on LEO satellites, and a realsatellite dataset. The results underscore the effectiveness of our approach,highlighting SEC's ability to run lightweight ML models on real andhigh-resolution satellite imagery. Our approach dramatically reduces FLconvergence time by nearly 30 times, and satellite energy consumption down toas low as 1.38 watts, all while maintaining an exceptional accuracy of up to96%.</description><author>Mohamed Elmahallawy, Tie Luo</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 15:10:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15541v2</guid></item><item><title>SiT-MLP: A Simple MLP with Point-wise Topology Feature Learning for Skeleton-based Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16018v4</link><description>Graph convolution networks (GCNs) have achieved remarkable performance inskeleton-based action recognition.
