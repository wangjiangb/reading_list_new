Some studies reveal that the performance of LLMs depends on boththe density and the position of the key information (question relevant) in theinput prompt. Inspired by these findings, we propose LongLLMLingua for promptcompression towards improving LLMs' perception of the key information tosimultaneously address the three challenges. We conduct evaluation on a widerange of long context scenarios including single-/multi-document QA, few-shotlearning, summarization, synthetic tasks, and code completion. The experimentalresults show that LongLLMLingua compressed prompt can derive higher performancewith much less cost. The latency of the end-to-end system is also reduced. Forexample, on NaturalQuestions benchmark, LongLLMLingua gains a performance boostof up to 17.1% over the original prompt with ~4x fewer tokens as input toGPT-3.5-Turbo. It can derive cost savings of \$28.5 and \$27.4 per 1,000samples from the LongBench and ZeroScrolls benchmark, respectively.Additionally, when compressing prompts of ~10k tokens at a compression rate of2x-10x, LongLLMLingua can speed up the end-to-end latency by 1.4x-3.8x.

For movies, this presents notable challenges -- AD must occur onlyduring existing pauses in dialogue, should refer to characters by name, andought to aid understanding of the storyline as a whole. To this end, we developa new model for automatically generating movie AD, given CLIP visual featuresof the frames, the cast list, and the temporal locations of the speech;addressing all three of the 'who', 'when', and 'what' questions: (i) who -- weintroduce a character bank consisting of the character's name, the actor thatplayed the part, and a CLIP feature of their face, for the principal cast ofeach movie, and demonstrate how this can be used to improve naming in thegenerated AD; (ii) when -- we investigate several models for determiningwhether an AD should be generated for a time interval or not, based on thevisual content of the interval and its neighbours; and (iii) what -- weimplement a new vision-language model for this task, that can ingest theproposals from the character bank, whilst conditioning on the visual featuresusing cross-attention, and demonstrate how this improves over previousarchitectures for AD text generation in an apples-to-apples comparison.</description><author>Tengda Han, Max Bain, Arsha Nagrani, Gül Varol, Weidi Xie, Andrew Zisserman</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 18:59:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06838v1</guid></item><item><title>Generating and Evaluating Tests for K-12 Students with Language Model Simulations: A Case Study on Sentence Reading Efficiency</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06837v1</link><description>Developing an educational test can be expensive and time-consuming, as eachitem must be written by experts and then evaluated by collecting hundreds ofstudent responses. Moreover, many tests require multiple distinct sets ofquestions administered throughout the school year to closely monitor students'progress, known as parallel tests. In this study, we focus on tests of silentsentence reading efficiency, used to assess students' reading ability overtime. To generate high-quality parallel tests, we propose to fine-tune largelanguage models (LLMs) to simulate how previous students would have respondedto unseen items. With these simulated responses, we can estimate each item'sdifficulty and ambiguity. We first use GPT-4 to generate new test itemsfollowing a list of expert-developed rules and then apply a fine-tuned LLM tofilter the items based on criteria from psychological measurements. We alsopropose an optimal-transport-inspired technique for generating parallel testsand show the generated tests closely correspond to the original test'sdifficulty and reliability based on crowdworker responses. Our evaluation of agenerated test with 234 students from grades 2 to 8 produces test scores highlycorrelated (r=0.93) to those of a standard test form written by human expertsand evaluated across thousands of K-12 students.</description><author>Eric Zelikman, Wanjing Anya Ma, Jasmine E.

Our objective in this paper is toprobe the diffusion network to determine to what extent it 'understands'different properties of the 3D scene depicted in an image. To this end, we makethe following contributions: (i) We introduce a protocol to evaluate whether anetwork models a number of physical 'properties' of the 3D scene by probing forexplicit features that represent these properties. The probes are applied ondatasets of real images with annotations for the property. (ii) We apply thisprotocol to properties covering scene geometry, scene material, supportrelations, lighting, and view dependent measures. (iii) We find that StableDiffusion is good at a number of properties including scene geometry, supportrelations, shadows and depth, but less performant for occlusion. (iv) We alsoapply the probes to other models trained at large-scale, including DINO andCLIP, and find their performance inferior to that of Stable Diffusion.</description><author>Guanqi Zhan, Chuanxia Zheng, Weidi Xie, Andrew Zisserman</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 18:59:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06836v1</guid></item><item><title>Scalable Semantic Non-Markovian Simulation Proxy for Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06835v1</link><description>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have shown much promise acrossa variety of applications. However, issues such as scalability, explainability,and Markovian assumptions limit its applicability in certain domains. Weobserve that many of these shortcomings emanate from the simulator as opposedto the RL training algorithms themselves. As such, we propose a semantic proxyfor simulation based on a temporal extension to annotated logic. In comparisonwith two high-fidelity simulators, we show up to three orders of magnitudespeed-up while preserving the quality of policy learned in addition to showingthe ability to model and leverage non-Markovian dynamics and instantaneousactions while providing an explainable trace describing the outcomes of theagent actions.</description><author>Kaustuv Mukherji, Devendra Parkar, Lahari Pokala, Dyuman Aditya, Paulo Shakarian, Clark Dorman</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 18:59:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06835v1</guid></item><item><title>Lemur: Harmonizing Natural Language and Code for Language Agents</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06830v1</link><description>We introduce Lemur and Lemur-Chat, openly accessible language modelsoptimized for both natural language and coding capabilities to serve as thebackbone of versatile language agents. The evolution from language chat modelsto functional language agents demands that models not only master humaninteraction, reasoning, and planning but also ensure grounding in the relevantenvironments. This calls for a harmonious blend of language and codingcapabilities in the models. Lemur and Lemur-Chat are proposed to address thisnecessity, demonstrating balanced proficiencies in both domains, unlikeexisting open-source models that tend to specialize in either. Throughmeticulous pre-training using a code-intensive corpus and instructionfine-tuning on text and code data, our models achieve state-of-the-art averagedperformance across diverse text and coding benchmarks among open-source models.Comprehensive experiments demonstrate Lemur's superiority over existingopen-source models and its proficiency across various agent tasks involvinghuman communication, tool usage, and interaction under fully- and partially-observable environments. The harmonization between natural and programminglanguages enables Lemur-Chat to significantly narrow the gap with proprietarymodels on agent abilities, providing key insights into developing advancedopen-source agents adept at reasoning, planning, and operating seamlesslyacross environments. https://github.com/OpenLemur/Lemur</description><author>Yiheng Xu, Hongjin Su, Chen Xing, Boyu Mi, Qian Liu, Weijia Shi, Binyuan Hui, Fan Zhou, Yitao Liu, Tianbao Xie, Zhoujun Cheng, Siheng Zhao, Lingpeng Kong, Bailin Wang, Caiming Xiong, Tao Yu</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 18:57:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06830v1</guid></item><item><title>Teaching Language Models to Hallucinate Less with Synthetic Tasks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06827v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate on abstractivesummarization tasks such as document-based question-answering, meetingsummarization, and clinical report generation, even though all necessaryinformation is included in context. However, optimizing LLMs to hallucinateless on these tasks is challenging, as hallucination is hard to efficientlyevaluate at each optimization step. In this work, we show that reducinghallucination on a synthetic task can also reduce hallucination on real-worlddownstream tasks. Our method, SynTra, first designs a synthetic task wherehallucinations are easy to elicit and measure. It next optimizes the LLM'ssystem message via prefix-tuning on the synthetic task, and finally transfersthe system message to realistic, hard-to-optimize tasks. Across three realisticabstractive summarization tasks, SynTra reduces hallucination for two13B-parameter LLMs using only a synthetic retrieval task for supervision. Wealso find that optimizing the system message rather than the model weights canbe critical; fine-tuning the entire model on the synthetic task cancounterintuitively increase hallucination. Overall, SynTra demonstrates thatthe extra flexibility of working with synthetic data can help mitigateundesired behaviors in practice.</description><author>Erik Jones, Hamid Palangi, Clarisse Simões, Varun Chandrasekaran, Subhabrata Mukherjee, Arindam Mitra, Ahmed Awadallah, Ece Kamar</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 18:57:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06827v1</guid></item><item><title>Mistral 7B</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06825v1</link><description>We introduce Mistral 7B v0.1, a 7-billion-parameter language model engineeredfor superior performance and efficiency.

Recent work has developed techniques for inferringwhether a LLM is telling the truth by training probes on the LLM's internalactivations. However, this line of work is controversial, with some authorspointing out failures of these probes to generalize in basic ways, among otherconceptual issues. In this work, we curate high-quality datasets of true/falsestatements and use them to study in detail the structure of LLM representationsof truth, drawing on three lines of evidence: 1. Visualizations of LLMtrue/false statement representations, which reveal clear linear structure. 2.Transfer experiments in which probes trained on one dataset generalize todifferent datasets. 3. Causal evidence obtained by surgically intervening in aLLM's forward pass, causing it to treat false statements as true and viceversa. Overall, we present evidence that language models linearly represent thetruth or falsehood of factual statements. We also introduce a novel technique,mass-mean probing, which generalizes better and is more causally implicated inmodel outputs than other probing techniques.</description><author>Samuel Marks, Max Tegmark</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 18:54:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06824v1</guid></item><item><title>NECO: NEural Collapse Based Out-of-distribution detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06823v1</link><description>Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is a critical challenge in machinelearning due to model overconfidence, often without awareness of theirepistemological limits. We hypothesize that ``neural collapse'', a phenomenonaffecting in-distribution data for models trained beyond loss convergence, alsoinfluences OOD data. To benefit from this interplay, we introduce NECO, a novelpost-hoc method for OOD detection, which leverages the geometric properties of``neural collapse'' and of principal component spaces to identify OOD data. Ourextensive experiments demonstrate that NECO achieves state-of-the-art resultson both small and large-scale OOD detection tasks while exhibiting stronggeneralization capabilities across different network architectures.Furthermore, we provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of ourmethod in OOD detection.

In this work, westudy the use of neural networks as bounding volumes. Our key observation isthat bounding, which so far has primarily been considered a problem ofcomputational geometry, can be redefined as a problem of learning to classifyspace into free and empty. This learning-based approach is particularlyadvantageous in high-dimensional spaces, such as animated scenes with complexqueries, where neural networks are known to excel. However, unlocking neuralbounding requires a twist: allowing -- but also limiting -- false positives,while ensuring that the number of false negatives is strictly zero. We enablesuch tight and conservative results using a dynamically-weighted asymmetricloss function. Our results show that our neural bounding produces up to anorder of magnitude fewer false positives than traditional methods.</description><author>Wenxin Liu, Michael Fischer, Paul D.

However, these models stillstruggle with complex prompts, such as those that involve numeracy and spatialreasoning. This work proposes to enhance prompt understanding capabilities indiffusion models. Our method leverages a pretrained large language model (LLM)for grounded generation in a novel two-stage process. In the first stage, theLLM generates a scene layout that comprises captioned bounding boxes from agiven prompt describing the desired image. In the second stage, a novelcontroller guides an off-the-shelf diffusion model for layout-grounded imagegeneration. Both stages utilize existing pretrained models without additionalmodel parameter optimization. Our method significantly outperforms the basediffusion model and several strong baselines in accurately generating imagesaccording to prompts that require various capabilities, doubling the generationaccuracy across four tasks on average. Furthermore, our method enablesinstruction-based multi-round scene specification and can handle prompts inlanguages not supported by the underlying diffusion model. We anticipate thatour method will unleash users' creativity by accurately following more complexprompts.</description><author>Long Lian, Boyi Li, Adam Yala, Trevor Darrell</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 18:46:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13655v2</guid></item><item><title>Text Embeddings Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06816v1</link><description>How much private information do text embeddings reveal about the originaltext?

Evaluating LLM Reasoning via Debate</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13160v2</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have shown impressiveperformance in complex reasoning tasks. However, it is difficult to knowwhether the models are reasoning based on deep understandings of truth andlogic, or leveraging their memorized patterns in a relatively superficial way.In this work, we explore testing LLMs' reasoning by engaging with them in adebate-like conversation, where given a question, the LLM and the user need todiscuss to make the correct decision starting from opposing arguments. Uponmitigating the Clever Hans effect, our task requires the LLM to not onlyachieve the correct answer on its own, but also be able to hold and defend itsbelief instead of blindly believing or getting misled by the user's (invalid)arguments and critiques, thus testing in greater depth whether the LLM graspsthe essence of the reasoning required to solve the problem. Across a range ofcomplex reasoning benchmarks spanning math, commonsense, logic and BIG-Benchtasks, we find that despite their impressive performance as reported inexisting work on generating correct step-by-step solutions in the beginning,LLMs like ChatGPT cannot maintain their beliefs in truth for a significantportion of examples when challenged by oftentimes absurdly invalid arguments.Our work points to danger zones of model alignment, and also suggests morecareful treatments and interpretations of the recent findings that LLMs canimprove their responses based on feedback.</description><author>Boshi Wang, Xiang Yue, Huan Sun</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 18:34:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13160v2</guid></item><item><title>NEFTune: Noisy Embeddings Improve Instruction Finetuning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05914v2</link><description>We show that language model finetuning can be improved, sometimesdramatically, with a simple augmentation.

Pre-filling aradiology report holds promise in mitigating reporting errors, and despiteefforts in the literature to generate medical reports, there exists a lack ofapproaches that exploit the longitudinal nature of patient visit records in theMIMIC-CXR dataset. To address this gap, we propose to use longitudinalmulti-modal data, i.e., previous patient visit CXR, current visit CXR, andprevious visit report, to pre-fill the 'findings' section of a current patientvisit report. We first gathered the longitudinal visit information for 26,625patients from the MIMIC-CXR dataset and created a new dataset calledLongitudinal-MIMIC. With this new dataset, a transformer-based model wastrained to capture the information from longitudinal patient visit recordscontaining multi-modal data (CXR images + reports) via a cross-attention-basedmulti-modal fusion module and a hierarchical memory-driven decoder. In contrastto previous work that only uses current visit data as input to train a model,our work exploits the longitudinal information available to pre-fill the'findings' section of radiology reports.

Mostexisting methods rely on Class Activation Maps (CAM) to derive pixel-levelpseudo-labels and use them to train a fully supervised semantic segmentationmodel. Although these pseudo-labels are class-aware, indicating the coarseregions for particular classes, they are not object-aware and fail to delineateaccurate object boundaries. To address this, we introduce a simple yeteffective method harnessing the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a class-agnosticfoundation model capable of producing fine-grained instance masks of objects,parts, and subparts. We use CAM pseudo-labels as cues to select and combine SAMmasks, resulting in high-quality pseudo-labels that are both class-aware andobject-aware.

In a single-agent setting, IL has proven to be doneefficiently through an inverse soft-Q learning process given expertdemonstrations. However, extending this framework to a multi-agent contextintroduces the need to simultaneously learn both local value functions tocapture local observations and individual actions, and a joint value functionfor exploiting centralized learning. In this work, we introduce a novelmulti-agent IL algorithm designed to address these challenges. Our approachenables the centralized learning by leveraging mixing networks to aggregatedecentralized Q functions. A main advantage of this approach is that theweights of the mixing networks can be trained using information derived fromglobal states. We further establish conditions for the mixing networks underwhich the multi-agent objective function exhibits convexity within the Qfunction space.

Next, in the integration and deployment stage, the goal is toevaluate an integrated ML-enabled system consisting of both ML and non-MLcomponents. Finally, once the ML-enabled software system is deployed andoperationalized, the T&amp;E objective is to ensure the system performs asintended. Maintenance activities for ML-enabled software systems span thelifecycle and involve maintaining various assets of ML-enabled softwaresystems. Given its unique characteristics, the T&amp;E of ML-enabled software systems ischallenging. While significant research has been reported on T&amp;E at thecomponent level, limited work is reported on T&amp;E in the remaining two stages.Furthermore, in many cases, there is a lack of systematic T&amp;E strategiesthroughout the ML-enabled system's lifecycle. This leads practitioners toresort to ad-hoc T&amp;E practices, which can undermine user confidence in thereliability of ML-enabled software systems. New systematic testing approaches,adequacy measurements, and metrics are required to address the T&amp;E challengesacross all stages of the ML-enabled system lifecycle.</description><author>Jaganmohan Chandrasekaran, Tyler Cody, Nicola McCarthy, Erin Lanus, Laura Freeman</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 18:11:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06800v1</guid></item><item><title>$f$-Policy Gradients: A General Framework for Goal Conditioned RL using $f$-Divergences</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06794v1</link><description>Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems often have access tosparse rewards where the agent receives a reward signal only when it hasachieved the goal, making policy optimization a difficult problem. Severalworks augment this sparse reward with a learned dense reward function, but thiscan lead to sub-optimal policies if the reward is misaligned. Moreover, recentworks have demonstrated that effective shaping rewards for a particular problemcan depend on the underlying learning algorithm. This paper introduces a novelway to encourage exploration called $f$-Policy Gradients, or $f$-PG. $f$-PGminimizes the f-divergence between the agent's state visitation distributionand the goal, which we show can lead to an optimal policy. We derive gradientsfor various f-divergences to optimize this objective. Our learning paradigmprovides dense learning signals for exploration in sparse reward settings. Wefurther introduce an entropy-regularized policy optimization objective, that wecall $state$-MaxEnt RL (or $s$-MaxEnt RL) as a special case of our objective.We show that several metric-based shaping rewards like L2 can be used with$s$-MaxEnt RL, providing a common ground to study such metric-based shapingrewards with efficient exploration. We find that $f$-PG has better performancecompared to standard policy gradient methods on a challenging gridworld as wellas the Point Maze and FetchReach environments.

In low-rank bandits, the matrix to be recoveredspecifies the expected arm rewards, and for low-rank Markov Decision Processes(MDPs), it may for example characterize the transition kernel of the MDP. Inboth cases, each entry of the matrix carries important information, and we seekestimation methods with low entry-wise error. Importantly, these methodsfurther need to accommodate for inherent correlations in the available data(e.g. for MDPs, the data consists of system trajectories). We investigate theperformance of simple spectral-based matrix estimation approaches: we show thatthey efficiently recover the singular subspaces of the matrix and exhibitnearly-minimal entry-wise error. These new results on low-rank matrixestimation make it possible to devise reinforcement learning algorithms thatfully exploit the underlying low-rank structure. We provide two examples ofsuch algorithms: a regret minimization algorithm for low-rank bandit problems,and a best policy identification algorithm for reward-free RL in low-rank MDPs.Both algorithms yield state-of-the-art performance guarantees.</description><author>Stefan Stojanovic, Yassir Jedra, Alexandre Proutiere</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 18:06:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06793v1</guid></item><item><title>Dynamic Subgoal-based Exploration via Bayesian Optimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09143v4</link><description>Reinforcement learning in sparse-reward navigation environments withexpensive and limited interactions is challenging and poses a need foreffective exploration. Motivated by complex navigation tasks that requirereal-world training (when cheap simulators are not available), we consider anagent that faces an unknown distribution of environments and must decide on anexploration strategy. It may leverage a series of training environments toimprove its policy before it is evaluated in a test environment drawn from thesame environment distribution. Most existing approaches focus on fixedexploration strategies, while the few that view exploration as ameta-optimization problem tend to ignore the need for cost-efficientexploration. We propose a cost-aware Bayesian optimization approach thatefficiently searches over a class of dynamic subgoal-based explorationstrategies. The algorithm adjusts a variety of levers -- the locations of thesubgoals, the length of each episode, and the number of replications per trial-- in order to overcome the challenges of sparse rewards, expensiveinteractions, and noise. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that the newapproach outperforms existing baselines across a number of problem domains. Wealso provide a theoretical foundation and prove that the method asymptoticallyidentifies a near-optimal subgoal design.</description><author>Yijia Wang, Matthias Poloczek, Daniel R.

Here wepresent a modification of EDMD-DL that concurrently determines both thedictionary of observables and the corresponding approximation of the Koopmanoperator. This innovation leverages automatic differentiation to facilitategradient descent computations through the pseudoinverse. We also address theperformance of several alternative methodologies. We assess a 'pure' Koopmanapproach, which involves the direct time-integration of a linear,high-dimensional system governing the dynamics within the space of observables.Additionally, we explore a modified approach where the system alternatesbetween spaces of states and observables at each time step -- this approach nolonger satisfies the linearity of the true Koopman operator representation. Forfurther comparisons, we also apply a state space approach (neural ODEs). Weconsider systems encompassing two and three-dimensional ordinary differentialequation systems featuring steady, oscillatory, and chaotic attractors, as wellas partial differential equations exhibiting increasingly complex and intricatebehaviors. Our framework significantly outperforms EDMD-DL. Furthermore, thestate space approach offers superior performance compared to the 'pure' Koopmanapproach where the entire time evolution occurs in the space of observables.When the temporal evolution of the Koopman approach alternates between statesand observables at each time step, however, its predictions become comparableto those of the state space approach.</description><author>C.

SEMC-AD employs a supervised embedding approachbased on deep neural networks, utilizing historical alarm logs and their labelsto extract numerical representations for each log, effectively addressing theissue of imbalanced classification due to a small proportion of anomalies inthe dataset without employing one-hot encoding. The robustness of the embeddingis evaluated by plotting the two most significant principle components of theembedded alarm logs, revealing that anomalies form distinct clusters withsimilar embeddings. Multivariate normal Gaussian clustering is then applied tothese components, identifying clusters with a high ratio of anomalies to normalalarms (above 90%) and labeling them as the anomaly group. To classify newalarm logs, we check if their embedded vectors' two most significant principlecomponents fall within the anomaly-labeled clusters. If so, the log isclassified as an anomaly. Performance evaluation demonstrates that SEMC-ADoutperforms conventional random forest and gradient boosting methods withoutembedding. SEMC-AD achieves 99% anomaly detection, whereas random forest andXGBoost only detect 86% and 81% of anomalies, respectively. While supervisedclassification methods may excel in labeled datasets, the results demonstratethat SEMC-AD is more efficient in classifying anomalies in datasets withnumerous categorical features, significantly enhancing anomaly detection,reducing operator burden, and improving network maintenance.</description><author>R.

However,erroneous generations, such as false predictions, misinformation, andhallucination made by LLMs, have also raised severe concerns for thetrustworthiness of LLMs', especially in safety-, security- andreliability-sensitive scenarios, potentially hindering real-world adoptions.While uncertainty estimation has shown its potential for interpreting theprediction risks made by general machine learning (ML) models, little is knownabout whether and to what extent it can help explore an LLM's capabilities andcounteract its undesired behavior. To bridge the gap, in this paper, weinitiate an exploratory study on the risk assessment of LLMs from the lens ofuncertainty. In particular, we experiment with twelve uncertainty estimationmethods and four LLMs on four prominent natural language processing (NLP) tasksto investigate to what extent uncertainty estimation techniques could helpcharacterize the prediction risks of LLMs. Our findings validate theeffectiveness of uncertainty estimation for revealing LLMs'uncertain/non-factual predictions. In addition to general NLP tasks, weextensively conduct experiments with four LLMs for code generation on twodatasets.

Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promise inaddressing this challenge, with sampling-based and regression-based methodsemerging as two prominent approaches. However, these methods have notablelimitations. Sampling-based methods often suffer from low efficiency due to theneed for generating multiple candidate structures for selection. On the otherhand, regression-based methods offer fast predictions but may experiencedecreased accuracy.

In this paper, we introduce TRACE, a novel benchmarkdesigned to evaluate continual learning in LLMs. TRACE consists of 8 distinctdatasets spanning challenging tasks including domain-specific tasks,multilingual capabilities, code generation, and mathematical reasoning. Alldatasets are standardized into a unified format, allowing for effortlessautomatic evaluation of LLMs. Our experiments show that after training onTRACE, aligned LLMs exhibit significant declines in both general ability andinstruction-following capabilities.

This phenomenon has attractedsignificant attention in measuring the similarity between features learned bydistinct networks. However, feature similarity could be vague in describing thesame feature since equivalent features hardly exist. In this paper, we expandthe concept of equivalent feature and provide the definition of what we callfunctionally equivalent features. These features produce equivalent outputunder certain transformations. Using this definition, we aim to derive a moreintrinsic metric for the so-called feature complexity regarding the redundancyof features learned by a neural network at each layer. We offer a formalinterpretation of our approach through the lens of category theory, awell-developed area in mathematics. To quantify the feature complexity, wefurther propose an efficient algorithm named Iterative Feature Merging. Ourexperimental results validate our ideas and theories from various perspectives.We empirically demonstrate that the functionally equivalence widely existsamong different features learned by the same neural network and we could reducethe number of parameters of the network without affecting the performance.TheIFM shows great potential as a data-agnostic model prune method.

Few-shot selection -- selectingappropriate examples for each test instance separately -- is important forin-context learning. In this paper, we propose Skill-KNN, a skill-basedfew-shot selection method for in-context learning. The key advantages ofSkill-KNN include: (1) it addresses the problem that existing methods based onpre-trained embeddings can be easily biased by surface natural languagefeatures that are not important for the target task; (2) it does not requiretraining or fine-tuning of any models, making it suitable for frequentlyexpanding or changing example banks. The key insight is to optimize the inputsfed into the embedding model, rather than tuning the model itself. Technically,Skill-KNN generates the skill-based descriptions for each test case andcandidate example by utilizing a pre-processing few-shot prompting, thuseliminating unimportant surface features. Experimental results across fivecross-domain semantic parsing datasets and six backbone models show thatSkill-KNN significantly outperforms existing methods.</description><author>Shengnan An, Bo Zhou, Zeqi Lin, Qiang Fu, Bei Chen, Nanning Zheng, Weizhu Chen, Jian-Guang Lou</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 17:23:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14210v2</guid></item><item><title>StepMix: A Python Package for Pseudo-Likelihood Estimation of Generalized Mixture Models with External Variables</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03853v4</link><description>StepMix is an open-source Python package for the pseudo-likelihood estimation(one-, two- and three-step approaches) of generalized finite mixture models(latent profile and latent class analysis) with external variables (covariatesand distal outcomes). In many applications in social sciences, the mainobjective is not only to cluster individuals into latent classes, but also touse these classes to develop more complex statistical models. These modelsgenerally divide into a measurement model that relates the latent classes toobserved indicators, and a structural model that relates covariates and outcomevariables to the latent classes. The measurement and structural models can beestimated jointly using the so-called one-step approach or sequentially usingstepwise methods, which present significant advantages for practitionersregarding the interpretability of the estimated latent classes. In addition tothe one-step approach, StepMix implements the most important stepwiseestimation methods from the literature, including the bias-adjusted three-stepmethods with Bolk-Croon-Hagenaars and maximum likelihood corrections and themore recent two-step approach. These pseudo-likelihood estimators are presentedin this paper under a unified framework as specific expectation-maximizationsubroutines. To facilitate and promote their adoption among the data sciencecommunity, StepMix follows the object-oriented design of the scikit-learnlibrary and provides an additional R wrapper.</description><author>Sacha Morin, Robin Legault, Félix Laliberté, Zsuzsa Bakk, Charles-Édouard Giguère, Roxane de la Sablonnière, Éric Lacourse</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 17:22:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03853v4</guid></item><item><title>Causal Rule Learning: Enhancing the Understanding of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect via Weighted Causal Rules</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06746v1</link><description>Interpretability is a key concern in estimating heterogeneous treatmenteffects using machine learning methods, especially for healthcare applicationswhere high-stake decisions are often made. Inspired by the Predictive,Descriptive, Relevant framework of interpretability, we propose causal rulelearning which finds a refined set of causal rules characterizing potentialsubgroups to estimate and enhance our understanding of heterogeneous treatmenteffects. Causal rule learning involves three phases: rule discovery, ruleselection, and rule analysis. In the rule discovery phase, we utilize a causalforest to generate a pool of causal rules with corresponding subgroup averagetreatment effects. The selection phase then employs a D-learning method toselect a subset of these rules to deconstruct individual-level treatmenteffects as a linear combination of the subgroup-level effects. This helps toanswer an ignored question by previous literature: what if an individualsimultaneously belongs to multiple groups with different average treatmenteffects? The rule analysis phase outlines a detailed procedure to furtheranalyze each rule in the subset from multiple perspectives, revealing the mostpromising rules for further validation. The rules themselves, theircorresponding subgroup treatment effects, and their weights in the linearcombination give us more insights into heterogeneous treatment effects.Simulation and real-world data analysis demonstrate the superior performance ofcausal rule learning on the interpretable estimation of heterogeneous treatmenteffect when the ground truth is complex and the sample size is sufficient.</description><author>Ying Wu, Hanzhong Liu, Kai Ren, Xiangyu Chang</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 17:19:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06746v1</guid></item><item><title>HiFi-123: Towards High-fidelity One Image to 3D Content Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06744v1</link><description>Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled 3D generationfrom a single image.

These specialized models tend to be data-hungry and oftenexhibit limitations in generalizing to out-of-distribution samples. Recently,foundation models have been proposed, which combine data from various domainsand demonstrate excellent generalization capabilities. Building upon this, thiswork introduces the incorporation of diverse medical image domains, includingdifferent imaging modalities like X-ray, MRI, CT, and ultrasound images, aswell as various viewpoints such as axial, coronal, and sagittal views. We referto this approach as multi-domain model and compare its performance to that ofspecialized models. Our findings underscore the superior generalizationcapabilities of multi-domain models, particularly in scenarios characterized bylimited data availability and out-of-distribution, frequently encountered inhealthcare applications. The integration of diverse data allows multi-domainmodels to utilize shared information across domains, enhancing the overalloutcomes significantly. To illustrate, for organ recognition, multi-domainmodel can enhance accuracy by up to 10% compared to conventional specializedmodels.</description><author>Ece Ozkan, Xavier Boix</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 17:07:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06737v1</guid></item><item><title>Growing ecosystem of deep learning methods for modeling protein$\unicode{x2013}$protein interactions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06725v1</link><description>Numerous cellular functions rely on protein$\unicode{x2013}$proteininteractions.

Depending on the Reynolds number ofthe flow, the Navier-Stokes equations may exhibit a highly nonlinear behavior.The system of nonlinear equations resulting from the discretization of theNavier-Stokes equations can be solved using nonlinear iteration methods, suchas Newton's method. However, fast quadratic convergence is typically onlyobtained in a local neighborhood of the solution, and for many configurations,the classical Newton iteration does not converge at all. In such cases,so-called globalization techniques may help to improve convergence. In this paper, pseudo-transient continuation is employed in order to improvenonlinear convergence. The classical algorithm is enhanced by a neural networkmodel that is trained to predict a local pseudo-time step. Generalization ofthe novel approach is facilitated by predicting the local pseudo-time stepseparately on each element using only local information on a patch of adjacentelements as input. Numerical results for standard benchmark problems, includingflow through a backward facing step geometry and Couette flow, show theperformance of the machine learning-enhanced globalization approach; as thesoftware for the simulations, the CFD module of COMSOL Multiphysics isemployed.</description><author>Anouk Zandbergen, Tycho van Noorden, Alexander Heinlein</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 16:45:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06717v1</guid></item><item><title>S4Sleep: Elucidating the design space of deep-learning-based sleep stage classification models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06715v1</link><description>Scoring sleep stages in polysomnography recordings is a time-consuming taskplagued by significant inter-rater variability.

The underlying assumption is thatmodel probability correlates well with human judgment, with better translationsbeing more likely. However, research has shown that this assumption does notalways hold, and decoding strategies which directly optimize a utilityfunction, like Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) or Quality-Aware decoding cansignificantly improve translation quality over standard MAP decoding. The maindisadvantage of these methods is that they require an additional model topredict the utility, and additional steps during decoding, which makes theentire process computationally demanding. In this paper, we propose to make theNMT models themselves quality-aware by training them to estimate the quality oftheir own output. During decoding, we can use the model's own quality estimatesto guide the generation process and produce the highest-quality translationspossible. We demonstrate that the model can self-evaluate its own output duringtranslation, eliminating the need for a separate quality estimation model.Moreover, we show that using this quality signal as a prompt during MAPdecoding can significantly improve translation quality. When using the internalquality estimate to prune the hypothesis space during MBR decoding, we can notonly further improve translation quality, but also reduce inference speed bytwo orders of magnitude.</description><author>Christian Tomani, David Vilar, Markus Freitag, Colin Cherry, Subhajit Naskar, Mara Finkelstein, Daniel Cremers</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 16:33:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06707v1</guid></item><item><title>RL$^3$: Boosting Meta Reinforcement Learning via RL inside RL$^2$</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15909v2</link><description>Meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) methods such as RL$^2$ have emerged aspromising approaches for learning data-efficient RL algorithms tailored to agiven task distribution. However, these RL algorithms struggle withlong-horizon tasks and out-of-distribution tasks since they rely on recurrentneural networks to process the sequence of experiences instead of summarizingthem into general RL components such as value functions. Moreover, eventransformers have a practical limit to the length of histories they canefficiently reason about before training and inference costs becomeprohibitive. In contrast, traditional RL algorithms are data-inefficient sincethey do not leverage domain knowledge, but they do converge to an optimalpolicy as more data becomes available. In this paper, we propose RL$^3$, aprincipled hybrid approach that combines traditional RL and meta-RL byincorporating task-specific action-values learned through traditional RL as aninput to the meta-RL neural network. We show that RL$^3$ earns greatercumulative reward on long-horizon and out-of-distribution tasks compared toRL$^2$, while maintaining the efficiency of the latter in the short term.Experiments are conducted on both custom and benchmark discrete domains fromthe meta-RL literature that exhibit a range of short-term, long-term, andcomplex dependencies.</description><author>Abhinav Bhatia, Samer B.

It generally consists in groupingsimilar reports through clustering techniques. However, with real-timestreaming bug collection, systems are needed to quickly answer the question:What are the most similar bugs to a new one?, that is, efficiently findnear-duplicates. It is thus natural to consider nearest neighbors search totackle this problem and especially the well-known locality-sensitive hashing(LSH) to deal with large datasets due to its sublinear performance andtheoretical guarantees on the similarity search accuracy. Surprisingly, LSH hasnot been considered in the crash bucketing literature. It is indeed not trivialto derive hash functions that satisfy the so-called locality-sensitive propertyfor the most advanced crash bucketing metrics. Consequently, we study in thispaper how to leverage LSH for this task. To be able to consider the mostrelevant metrics used in the literature, we introduce DeepLSH, a Siamese DNNarchitecture with an original loss function, that perfectly approximates thelocality-sensitivity property even for Jaccard and Cosine metrics for whichexact LSH solutions exist.

In this work, we studystructured pruning as an effective means to develop smaller LLMs frompre-trained, larger models. Our approach employs two key techniques: (1)targeted structured pruning, which prunes a larger model to a specified targetshape by removing layers, heads, and intermediate and hidden dimensions in anend-to-end manner, and (2) dynamic batch loading, which dynamically updates thecomposition of sampled data in each training batch based on varying lossesacross different domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach bypresenting the Sheared-LLaMA series, pruning the LLaMA2-7B model down to 1.3Band 2.7B parameters. Sheared-LLaMA models outperform state-of-the-artopen-source models of equivalent sizes, such as Pythia, INCITE, and OpenLLaMAmodels, on a wide range of downstream and instruction tuning evaluations, whilerequiring only 3% of compute compared to training such models from scratch.This work provides compelling evidence that leveraging existing LLMs withstructured pruning is a far more cost-effective approach for building smallerLLMs.</description><author>Mengzhou Xia, Tianyu Gao, Zhiyuan Zeng, Danqi Chen</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 16:13:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06694v1</guid></item><item><title>Strokes2Surface: Recovering Curve Networks From 4D Architectural Design Sketches</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07220v3</link><description>We present Strokes2Surface, an offline geometry reconstruction pipeline thatrecovers well-connected curve networks from imprecise 4D sketches to bridgeconcept design and digital modeling stages in architectural design.

However,current CoT methods either simply employ general prompts such as Let's thinkstep by step, or heavily rely on handcrafted task-specific demonstrations toattain preferable performances, thereby engendering an inescapable gap betweenperformance and generalization. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-CoT, ageneralizable CoT prompting method in mixed-task scenarios where the type ofinput questions is unknown. Meta-CoT firstly categorizes the scenario based onthe input question and subsequently constructs diverse demonstrations from thecorresponding data pool in an automatic pattern. Meta-CoT simultaneously enjoysremarkable performances on ten public benchmark reasoning tasks and superiorgeneralization capabilities. Notably, Meta-CoT achieves the state-of-the-artresult on SVAMP (93.7%) without any additional program-aided methods. Ourfurther experiments on five out-of-distribution datasets verify the stabilityand generality of Meta-CoT.</description><author>Anni Zou, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao, Xiangru Tang</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 16:10:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06692v1</guid></item><item><title>Self-Convinced Prompting: Few-Shot Question Answering with Repeated Introspection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05035v2</link><description>While large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and PaLM have demonstratedremarkable performance in various language understanding and generation tasks,their capabilities in complex reasoning and intricate knowledge utilizationstill fall short of human-level proficiency.

However,human preferences are multi-faceted, and it is increasingly common to derivereward from a composition of simpler reward models which each capture adifferent aspect of language quality. This itself presents a challenge, as itis difficult to appropriately weight these component RMs when combining them.Compounding this difficulty, because any RM is only a proxy for humanevaluation, this process is vulnerable to $\textit{overoptimization}$, whereinpast a certain point, accumulating higher reward is associated with worse humanratings. In this paper, we perform, to our knowledge, the first study onoveroptimization in composite RMs, showing that correlation between componentRMs has a significant effect on the locations of these points. We thenintroduce an approach to solve this issue using constrained reinforcementlearning as a means of preventing the agent from exceeding each RM's thresholdof usefulness. Our method addresses the problem of weighting component RMs bylearning dynamic weights, naturally expressed by Lagrange multipliers. As aresult, each RM stays within the range at which it is an effective proxy,improving evaluation performance. Finally, we introduce an adaptive methodusing gradient-free optimization to identify and optimize towards these pointsduring a single run.</description><author>Ted Moskovitz, Aaditya K.

Along another line of work, multiplex graph neural networks (GNNs)directly initialize node attributes as a feature vector for node representationlearning, but they cannot fully capture the semantics of the nodes' associatedtexts. To bridge these gaps, we propose METERN, a new framework for learningMultiplex Embeddings on TExt-Rich Networks. In contrast to existing methods,METERN uses one text encoder to model the shared knowledge across relations andleverages a small number of parameters per relation to derive relation-specificrepresentations. This allows the encoder to effectively capture the multiplexstructures in the network while also preserving parameter efficiency.

This has been aparticular concern in the era of large language models (LLMs)- based codegeneration, where LLMs, deemed a complex and powerful black-box model, isinstructed by a high-level natural language specification, namely a prompt, togenerate code. Nevertheless, effectively evaluating and explaining the codegeneration capability of LLMs is inherently challenging, given the complexityof LLMs and the lack of transparency. Inspired by the recent progress in causality analysis and its application insoftware engineering, this paper launches a causality analysis-based approachto systematically analyze the causal relations between the LLM input promptsand the generated code. To handle various technical challenges in this study,we first propose a novel causal graph-based representation of the prompt andthe generated code, which is established over the fine-grained,human-understandable concepts in the input prompts. The formed causal graph isthen used to identify the causal relations between the prompt and the derivedcode. We illustrate the insights that our framework can provide by studyingover 3 popular LLMs with over 12 prompt adjustment strategies. The results ofthese studies illustrate the potential of our technique to provide insightsinto LLM effectiveness, and aid end-users in understanding predictions.Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach provides actionable insights toimprove the quality of the LLM-generated code by properly calibrating theprompt.</description><author>Zhenlan Ji, Pingchuan Ma, Zongjie Li, Shuai Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 15:56:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06680v1</guid></item><item><title>Machine Learning Quantum Systems with Magnetic p-bits</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06679v1</link><description>The slowing down of Moore's Law has led to a crisis as the computingworkloads of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms continue skyrocketing.There is an urgent need for scalable and energy-efficient hardware catering tothe unique requirements of AI algorithms and applications.

In this paper, we propose to parallelize thewell-established covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) andin particular its one latest variant called limited-memory CMA (LM-CMA) forLSO. To achieve scalability while maintaining the invariance property as muchas possible, we present a multilevel learning-based meta-framework. Owing toits hierarchically organized structure, Meta-ES is well-suited to implement ourdistributed meta-framework, wherein the outer-ES controls strategy parameterswhile all parallel inner-ESs run the serial LM-CMA with different settings. Forthe distribution mean update of the outer-ES, both the elitist andmulti-recombination strategy are used in parallel to avoid stagnation andregression, respectively. To exploit spatiotemporal information, the globalstep-size adaptation combines Meta-ES with the parallel cumulative step-sizeadaptation. After each isolation time, our meta-framework employs both thestructure and parameter learning strategy to combine aligned evolution pathsfor CMA reconstruction.

Recently, In-Context Learning demonstrated significantperformance advances for reasoning tasks. In this paradigm, a large languagemodel performs predictions based on a small set of supporting exemplars. Theperformance of In-Context Learning depends heavily on the selection procedureof the supporting exemplars, particularly in the case of HybridQA, whereconsidering the diversity of reasoning chains and the large size of the hybridcontexts becomes crucial. In this work, we present Selection of ExEmplars forhybrid Reasoning (SEER), a novel method for selecting a set of exemplars thatis both representative and diverse. The key novelty of SEER is that itformulates exemplar selection as a Knapsack Integer Linear Program. TheKnapsack framework provides the flexibility to incorporate diversityconstraints that prioritize exemplars with desirable attributes, and capacityconstraints that ensure that the prompt size respects the provided capacitybudgets.

We introduce anovel approach of detection and interpretation of adversarial attacks from agraph perspective. For an input image, we compute an associated sparse graphusing the layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm \cite{bach15}.Specifically, we only keep edges of the neural network with the highestrelevance values. Three quantities are then computed from the graph which arethen compared against those computed from the training set. The result of thecomparison is a classification of the image as benign or adversarial. To makethe comparison, two classification methods are introduced: 1) an explicitformula based on Wasserstein distance applied to the degree of node and 2) alogistic regression. Both classification methods produce strong results whichlead us to believe that a graph-based interpretation of adversarial attacks isvaluable.</description><author>Dwight Nwaigwe, Lucrezia Carboni, Martial Mermillod, Sophie Achard, Michel Dojat</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 15:48:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00042v2</guid></item><item><title>Making Large Language Models Perform Better in Knowledge Graph Completion</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06671v1</link><description>Large language model (LLM) based knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims topredict the missing triples in the KGs with LLMs and enrich the KGs to becomebetter web infrastructure, which can benefit a lot of web-based automaticservices.

However, this holds for standard in-domain settings, inwhich the training and test data follow the same distribution. For theout-of-domain case, where the test data follow a different and unknowndistribution, the best recipe for data augmentation is unclear. In this paper,we show that for out-of-domain and domain generalization settings, dataaugmentation can provide a conspicuous and robust improvement in performance.To do that, we propose a simple training procedure: (i) use uniform sampling onstandard data augmentation transformations; (ii) increase the strengthtransformations to account for the higher data variance expected when workingout-of-domain, and (iii) devise a new reward function to reject extremetransformations that can harm the training. With this procedure, our dataaugmentation scheme achieves a level of accuracy that is comparable to orbetter than state-of-the-art methods on benchmark domain generalizationdatasets.

However, due to the unstructured nature of thelearned latent space, it inherits the bias from the training data wherespecific groups of visual attributes that are not causally related tend toappear together, a phenomenon also known as spurious correlations, e.g., ageand eyeglasses or women and lipsticks. Consequently, the learned distributionoften lacks the proper modelling of the missing examples. The interpolationfollowing editing directions for one attribute could result in entangledchanges with other attributes. To address this problem, previous workstypically adjust the learned directions to minimize the changes in otherattributes, yet they still fail on strongly correlated features.

In this study, we attributethe inefficiency to the myopia phenomenon caused by CAD: language models onlyfocus on causal features that are edited in the augmentation operation andexclude other non-edited causal features. Therefore, the potential of CAD isnot fully exploited. To address this issue, we analyze the myopia phenomenon infeature space from the perspective of Fisher's Linear Discriminant, then weintroduce two additional constraints based on CAD's structural properties(dataset-level and sentence-level) to help language models extract morecomplete causal features in CAD, thereby mitigating the myopia phenomenon andimproving OOD generalization capability.

Furthermore, we show that afine-tuned BERT does not generate more named entities specific to thefine-tuning dataset than a BERT model that is pre-trained only. This suggeststhat BERT is unlikely to emit personal or privacy sensitive named entities.Overall, our results are important to understand to what extent BERT-basedservices are prone to training data extraction attacks.</description><author>Andor Diera, Nicolas Lell, Aygul Garifullina, Ansgar Scherp</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 15:32:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03749v2</guid></item><item><title>Assessing the Impact of a Supervised Classification Filter on Flow-based Hybrid Network Anomaly Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06656v1</link><description>Constant evolution and the emergence of new cyberattacks require thedevelopment of advanced techniques for defense. This paper aims to measure theimpact of a supervised filter (classifier) in network anomaly detection. Weperform our experiments by employing a hybrid anomaly detection approach innetwork flow data. For this purpose, we extended a state-of-the-artautoencoder-based anomaly detection method by prepending a binary classifieracting as a prefilter for the anomaly detector. The method was evaluated on thepublicly available real-world dataset UGR'16. Our empirical results indicatethat the hybrid approach does offer a higher detection rate of known attacksthan a standalone anomaly detector while still retaining the ability to detectzero-day attacks.

With the improving performance of deep neural modelsproposed in the field of vision-and-language navigation (VLN), it is equallyinteresting to know what information the models utilize for theirdecision-making in the navigation tasks. To understand the inner workings ofdeep neural models, various explanation methods have been developed forpromoting explainable AI (XAI). But they are mostly applied to deep neuralmodels for image or text classification tasks and little work has been done inexplaining deep neural models for VLN tasks. In this paper, we address theseproblems by building quantitative benchmarks to evaluate explanation methodsfor VLN models in terms of faithfulness. We propose a new erasure-basedevaluation pipeline to measure the step-wise textual explanation in thesequential decision-making setting. We evaluate several explanation methods fortwo representative VLN models on two popular VLN datasets and reveal valuablefindings through our experiments.</description><author>Guanqi Chen, Lei Yang, Guanhua Chen, Jia Pan</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 15:22:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06654v1</guid></item><item><title>Branched Latent Neural Maps</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02599v3</link><description>We introduce Branched Latent Neural Maps (BLNMs) to learn finite dimensionalinput-output maps encoding complex physical processes. A BLNM is defined by asimple and compact feedforward partially-connected neural network thatstructurally disentangles inputs with different intrinsic roles, such as thetime variable from model parameters of a differential equation, whiletransferring them into a generic field of interest. BLNMs leverage latentoutputs to enhance the learned dynamics and break the curse of dimensionalityby showing excellent generalization properties with small training datasets andshort training times on a single processor. Indeed, their generalization errorremains comparable regardless of the adopted discretization during the testingphase. Moreover, the partial connections significantly reduce the number oftunable parameters. We show the capabilities of BLNMs in a challenging testcase involving electrophysiology simulations in a biventricular cardiac modelof a pediatric patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The model includesa 1D Purkinje network for fast conduction and a 3D heart-torso geometry.Specifically, we trained BLNMs on 150 in silico generated 12-leadelectrocardiograms (ECGs) while spanning 7 model parameters, coveringcell-scale and organ-level. Although the 12-lead ECGs manifest very fastdynamics with sharp gradients, after automatic hyperparameter tuning theoptimal BLNM, trained in less than 3 hours on a single CPU, retains just 7hidden layers and 19 neurons per layer. The resulting mean square error is onthe order of $10^{-4}$ on a test dataset comprised of 50 electrophysiologysimulations. In the online phase, the BLNM allows for 5000x faster real-timesimulations of cardiac electrophysiology on a single core standard computer andcan be used to solve inverse problems via global optimization in a few secondsof computational time.</description><author>Matteo Salvador, Alison Lesley Marsden</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 15:22:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02599v3</guid></item><item><title>Diversity from Human Feedback</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06648v1</link><description>Diversity plays a significant role in many problems, such as ensemblelearning, reinforcement learning, and combinatorial optimization. How to definethe diversity measure is a longstanding problem. Many methods rely on expertexperience to define a proper behavior space and then obtain the diversitymeasure, which is, however, challenging in many scenarios. In this paper, wepropose the problem of learning a behavior space from human feedback andpresent a general method called Diversity from Human Feedback (DivHF) to solveit. DivHF learns a behavior descriptor consistent with human preference byquerying human feedback. The learned behavior descriptor can be combined withany distance measure to define a diversity measure. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of DivHF by integrating it with the Quality-Diversityoptimization algorithm MAP-Elites and conducting experiments on the QDax suite.The results show that DivHF learns a behavior space that aligns better withhuman requirements compared to direct data-driven approaches and leads to morediverse solutions under human preference.

The segmentation framework generally consists of twostages: smoothing and thresholding, thus referred to as SaT. In the firststage, a smoothed image is obtained by an AITV-regularized Mumford-Shah (MS)model, which can be solved efficiently by the alternating direction method ofmultipliers (ADMM) with a closed-form solution of a proximal operator of the$\ell_1 -\alpha \ell_2$ regularizer. Convergence of the ADMM algorithm isanalyzed. In the second stage, we threshold the smoothed image by $K$-meansclustering to obtain the final segmentation result. Numerical experimentsdemonstrate that the proposed segmentation framework is versatile for bothgrayscale and color images, efficient in producing high-quality segmentationresults within a few seconds, and robust to input images that are corruptedwith noise, blur, or both. We compare the AITV method with its original convexTV and nonconvex TV$^p (0&lt;p&lt;1)$ counterparts, showcasing the qualitative andquantitative advantages of our proposed method.</description><author>Kevin Bui, Yifei Lou, Fredrick Park, Jack Xin</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 15:12:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10115v4</guid></item><item><title>Morphologically-Aware Consensus Computation via Heuristics-based IterATive Optimization (MACCHIatO)</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08066v2</link><description>The extraction of consensus segmentations from several binary orprobabilistic masks is important to solve various tasks such as the analysis ofinter-rater variability or the fusion of several neural network outputs. One ofthe most widely used methods to obtain such a consensus segmentation is theSTAPLE algorithm. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the output of thatalgorithm is heavily impacted by the background size of images and the choiceof the prior. We then propose a new method to construct a binary or aprobabilistic consensus segmentation based on the Fr\'{e}chet means ofcarefully chosen distances which makes it totally independent of the imagebackground size. We provide a heuristic approach to optimize this criterionsuch that a voxel's class is fully determined by its voxel-wise distance to thedifferent masks, the connected component it belongs to and the group of raterswho segmented it. We compared extensively our method on several datasets withthe STAPLE method and the naive segmentation averaging method, showing that itleads to binary consensus masks of intermediate size between Majority Votingand STAPLE and to different posterior probabilities than Mask Averaging andSTAPLE methods.

This work focuses onthe study of exploring LLMs, such as ChatGPT, as zero-shot relation extractors.On the one hand, we analyze the drawbacks of existing RE prompts and attempt toincorporate recent prompt techniques such as chain-of-thought (CoT) to improvezero-shot RE. We propose the summarize-and-ask (\textsc{SumAsk}) prompting, asimple prompt recursively using LLMs to transform RE inputs to the effectivequestion answering (QA) format. On the other hand, we conduct comprehensiveexperiments on various benchmarks and settings to investigate the capabilitiesof LLMs on zero-shot RE. Specifically, we have the following findings: (i)\textsc{SumAsk} consistently and significantly improves LLMs performance ondifferent model sizes, benchmarks and settings; (ii) Zero-shot prompting withChatGPT achieves competitive or superior results compared with zero-shot andfully supervised methods; (iii) LLMs deliver promising performance inextracting overlapping relations; (iv) The performance varies greatly regardingdifferent relations.

Previous methods tend to rely on the auto-decoderparadigm, which often requires densely-sampled and accurate signed distances tobe known during training and testing, as well as an additional optimizationloop during inference. This introduces a lot of computational overhead, inaddition to having to compute signed distances analytically, even duringtesting. In this paper, we present a novel encoder-decoder neural network forembedding 3D shapes in a single forward pass. Our architecture is based on amulti-scale hybrid system incorporating graph-based and voxel-based components,as well as a continuously differentiable decoder. Furthermore, the network istrained to solve the Eikonal equation and only requires knowledge of thezero-level set for training and inference. Additional volumetric samples can begenerated on-the-fly, and incorporated in an unsupervised manner. This meansthat in contrast to most previous work, our network is able to output validsigned distance fields without explicit prior knowledge of non-zero distancevalues or shape occupancy. In other words, our network computes approximatesolutions to the boundary-valued Eikonal equation. It also requires only asingle forward pass during inference, instead of the common latent codeoptimization. We further propose a modification of the loss function in casethat surface normals are not well defined, e.g., in the context ofnon-watertight surface-meshes and non-manifold geometry. We finally demonstratethe efficacy, generalizability and scalability of our method on datasetsconsisting of deforming 3D shapes, single class encoding and multiclassencoding, showcasing a wide range of possible applications.</description><author>Stefan Rhys Jeske, Jonathan Klein, Dominik L.

We propose using neural samplersthat specify implicit distributions, which are well-suited for approximatingcomplex multimodal and correlated posteriors in high-dimensional spaces. Ourapproach advances inference using implicit distributions by introducing novelbounds that come about by locally linearising the neural sampler. This isdistinct from existing methods that rely on additional discriminator networksand unstable adversarial objectives. Furthermore, we present a new samplerarchitecture that, for the first time, enables implicit distributions overmillions of latent variables, addressing computational concerns by usingdifferentiable numerical approximations. Our empirical analysis indicates ourmethod is capable of recovering correlations across layers in large Bayesianneural networks, a property that is crucial for a network's performance butnotoriously challenging to achieve. To the best of our knowledge, no othermethod has been shown to accomplish this task for such large models.

From a computational perspective, there should be anefficient algorithm to minimize an empirical error over the class. From anunderstanding point of view, the properties of the learned operator need to bederived, so its behavior can be theoretically understood. The statisticalbottleneck can be overcome due to the rich literature about the representationof lattice operators, but there is no general learning algorithm for them. Inthis paper, we discuss a learning paradigm in which, by overparametrizing aclass via elements in a lattice, an algorithm for minimizing functions in alattice is applied to learn. We present the stochastic lattice gradient descentalgorithm as a general algorithm to learn on constrained classes of operatorsas long as a lattice overparametrization of it is fixed, and we discussprevious works which are proves of concept. Moreover, if there are algorithmsto compute the basis of an operator from its overparametrization, then itsproperties can be deduced and the understanding bottleneck is also overcome.This learning paradigm has three properties that modern methods based on neuralnetworks lack: control, transparency and interpretability. Nowadays, there isan increasing demand for methods with these characteristics, and we believethat mathematical morphology is in a unique position to supply them. Thelattice overparametrization paradigm could be a missing piece for it to achieveits full potential within modern machine learning.</description><author>Diego Marcondes, Junior Barrera</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 15:00:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06639v1</guid></item><item><title>Blind Dates: Examining the Expression of Temporality in Historical Photographs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06633v1</link><description>This paper explores the capacity of computer vision models to discerntemporal information in visual content, focusing specifically on historicalphotographs. We investigate the dating of images using OpenCLIP, an open-sourceimplementation of CLIP, a multi-modal language and vision model. Our experimentconsists of three steps: zero-shot classification, fine-tuning, and analysis ofvisual content. We use the \textit{De Boer Scene Detection} dataset, containing39,866 gray-scale historical press photographs from 1950 to 1999. The resultsshow that zero-shot classification is relatively ineffective for image dating,with a bias towards predicting dates in the past. Fine-tuning OpenCLIP with alogistic classifier improves performance and eliminates the bias. Additionally,our analysis reveals that images featuring buses, cars, cats, dogs, and peopleare more accurately dated, suggesting the presence of temporal markers. Thestudy highlights the potential of machine learning models like OpenCLIP indating images and emphasizes the importance of fine-tuning for accuratetemporal analysis. Future research should explore the application of thesefindings to color photographs and diverse datasets.</description><author>Alexandra Barancová, Melvin Wevers, Nanne van Noord</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 14:51:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06633v1</guid></item><item><title>EViT: An Eagle Vision Transformer with Bi-Fovea Self-Attention</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06629v1</link><description>Because of the advancement of deep learning technology, vision transformerhas demonstrated competitive performance in various computer vision tasks.Unfortunately, vision transformer still faces some challenges such as highcomputational complexity and absence of desirable inductive bias. To alleviatethese problems, this study proposes a novel Bi-Fovea Self-Attention (BFSA)inspired by the physiological structure and characteristics of bi-fovea visionin eagle eyes. This BFSA can simulate the shallow fovea and deep foveafunctions of eagle vision, enabling the network to extract featurerepresentations of targets from coarse to fine, facilitating the interaction ofmulti-scale feature representations. Additionally, this study designs a BionicEagle Vision (BEV) block based on BFSA and CNN. It combines CNN and VisionTransformer, to enhance the network's local and global representation abilityfor targets. Furthermore, this study develops a unified and efficient generalpyramid backbone network family, named Eagle Vision Transformers (EViTs) bystacking the BEV blocks. Experimental results on various computer vision tasksincluding image classification, object detection, instance segmentation andother transfer learning tasks show that the proposed EViTs performsignificantly better than the baselines under similar model sizes, whichexhibits faster speed on graphics processing unit compared to other models.Code will be released at https://github.com/nkusyl.</description><author>Yulong Shi, Mingwei Sun, Yongshuai Wang, Rui Wang, Hui Sun, Zengqiang Chen</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 14:48:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06629v1</guid></item><item><title>DocumentNet: Bridging the Data Gap in Document Pre-Training</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08937v2</link><description>Document understanding tasks, in particular, Visually-rich Document EntityRetrieval (VDER), have gained significant attention in recent years thanks totheir broad applications in enterprise AI. However, publicly available datahave been scarce for these tasks due to strict privacy constraints and highannotation costs. To make things worse, the non-overlapping entity spaces fromdifferent datasets hinder the knowledge transfer between document types. Inthis paper, we propose a method to collect massive-scale and weakly labeleddata from the web to benefit the training of VDER models. The collecteddataset, named DocumentNet, does not depend on specific document types orentity sets, making it universally applicable to all VDER tasks. The currentDocumentNet consists of 30M documents spanning nearly 400 document typesorganized in a four-level ontology. Experiments on a set of broadly adoptedVDER tasks show significant improvements when DocumentNet is incorporated intothe pre-training for both classic and few-shot learning settings.

For instance, Cine MRI is the benchmarkmodality for assessing the cardiac function and anatomy. On the other hand,multi-contrast (T1 and T2) mapping has the potential to assess pathologies andabnormalities in the myocardium and interstitium. However, voluntarybreath-holding and often arrhythmia, in combination with MRI's slow imagingspeed, can lead to motion artifacts, hindering real-time acquisition imagequality. Although performing accelerated acquisitions can facilitate dynamicimaging, it induces aliasing, causing low reconstructed image quality in CineMRI and inaccurate T1 and T2 mapping estimation. In this work, inspired byrelated work in accelerated MRI reconstruction, we present a deep learning(DL)-based method for accelerated cine and multi-contrast reconstruction in thecontext of dynamic cardiac imaging. We formulate the reconstruction problem asa least squares regularized optimization task, and employ vSHARP, astate-of-the-art DL-based inverse problem solver, which incorporateshalf-quadratic variable splitting and the alternating direction method ofmultipliers with neural networks. We treat the problem in two setups; a 2Dreconstruction and a 2D dynamic reconstruction task, and employ 2D and 3D deeplearning networks, respectively. Our method optimizes in both the image andk-space domains, allowing for high reconstruction fidelity. Although the targetdata is undersampled with a Cartesian equispaced scheme, we train our modelusing both Cartesian and simulated non-Cartesian undersampling schemes toenhance generalization of the model to unseen data. Furthermore, our modeladopts a deep neural network to learn and refine the sensitivity maps ofmulti-coil k-space data. Lastly, our method is jointly trained on both,undersampled cine and multi-contrast data.</description><author>George Yiasemis, Nikita Moriakov, Jan-Jakob Sonke, Jonas Teuwen</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 14:46:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06628v1</guid></item></channel></rss>
