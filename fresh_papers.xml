Furthermore, due to the lack of generative prior on natural videos,existing methods cannot complete dynamic occluded regions. We present a novelgenerative layered video decomposition framework to address the omnimatteproblem. Our method does not assume a stationary scene or require camera poseor depth information and produces clean, complete layers, including convincingcompletions of occluded dynamic regions. Our core idea is to train a videodiffusion model to identify and remove scene effects caused by a specificobject. We show that this model can be finetuned from an existing videoinpainting model with a small, carefully curated dataset, and demonstratehigh-quality decompositions and editing results for a wide range of casuallycaptured videos containing soft shadows, glossy reflections, splashing water,and more.</description><author>Yao-Chih Lee, Erika Lu, Sarah Rumbley, Michal Geyer, Jia-Bin Huang, Tali Dekel, Forrester Cole</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:59:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16683v1</guid></item><item><title>Factorized Visual Tokenization and Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16681v1</link><description>Visual tokenizers are fundamental to image generation. They convert visualdata into discrete tokens, enabling transformer-based models to excel at imagegeneration. Despite their success, VQ-based tokenizers like VQGAN facesignificant limitations due to constrained vocabulary sizes. Simply expandingthe codebook often leads to training instability and diminishing performancegains, making scalability a critical challenge. In this work, we introduceFactorized Quantization (FQ), a novel approach that revitalizes VQ-basedtokenizers by decomposing a large codebook into multiple independentsub-codebooks. This factorization reduces the lookup complexity of largecodebooks, enabling more efficient and scalable visual tokenization. To ensureeach sub-codebook captures distinct and complementary information, we propose adisentanglement regularization that explicitly reduces redundancy, promotingdiversity across the sub-codebooks. Furthermore, we integrate representationlearning into the training process, leveraging pretrained vision models likeCLIP and DINO to infuse semantic richness into the learned representations.This design ensures our tokenizer captures diverse semantic levels, leading tomore expressive and disentangled representations. Experiments show that theproposed FQGAN model substantially improves the reconstruction quality ofvisual tokenizers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We furtherdemonstrate that this tokenizer can be effectively adapted into auto-regressiveimage generation. https://showlab.github.io/FQGAN</description><author>Zechen Bai, Jianxiong Gao, Ziteng Gao, Pichao Wang, Zheng Zhang, Tong He, Mike Zheng Shou</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:59:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16681v1</guid></item><item><title>Quark: Real-time, High-resolution, and General Neural View Synthesis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16680v1</link><description>We present a novel neural algorithm for performing high-quality,high-resolution, real-time novel view synthesis. From a sparse set of input RGBimages or videos streams, our network both reconstructs the 3D scene andrenders novel views at 1080p resolution at 30fps on an NVIDIA A100. Ourfeed-forward network generalizes across a wide variety of datasets and scenesand produces state-of-the-art quality for a real-time method. Our qualityapproaches, and in some cases surpasses, the quality of some of the top offlinemethods. In order to achieve these results we use a novel combination ofseveral key concepts, and tie them together into a cohesive and effectivealgorithm. We build on previous works that represent the scene usingsemi-transparent layers and use an iterative learned render-and-refine approachto improve those layers. Instead of flat layers, our method reconstructslayered depth maps (LDMs) that efficiently represent scenes with complex depthand occlusions. The iterative update steps are embedded in a multi-scale,UNet-style architecture to perform as much compute as possible at reducedresolution. Within each update step, to better aggregate the information frommultiple input views, we use a specialized Transformer-based network component.This allows the majority of the per-input image processing to be performed inthe input image space, as opposed to layer space, further increasingefficiency. Finally, due to the real-time nature of our reconstruction andrendering, we dynamically create and discard the internal 3D geometry for eachframe, generating the LDM for each view. Taken together, this produces a noveland effective algorithm for view synthesis. Through extensive evaluation, wedemonstrate that we achieve state-of-the-art quality at real-time rates.Project page: https://quark-3d.github.io/</description><author>John Flynn, Michael Broxton, Lukas Murmann, Lucy Chai, Matthew DuVall, Clément Godard, Kathryn Heal, Srinivas Kaza, Stephen Lombardi, Xuan Luo, Supreeth Achar, Kira Prabhu, Tiancheng Sun, Lynn Tsai, Ryan Overbeck</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:59:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16680v1</guid></item><item><title>Do Large Language Models Perform Latent Multi-Hop Reasoning without Exploiting Shortcuts?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16679v1</link><description>We evaluate how well Large Language Models (LLMs) latently recall and composefacts to answer multi-hop queries like "In the year Scarlett Johansson wasborn, the Summer Olympics were hosted in the country of". One major challengein evaluating this ability is that LLMs may have developed shortcuts byencounters of the head entity "Scarlett Johansson" and the answer entity"United States" in the same training sequences or merely guess the answer basedon frequency-based priors. To prevent shortcuts, we exclude test queries wherethe head and answer entities co-appear in pretraining corpora. Through carefulselection of relations and facts and systematic removal of cases where modelsmight guess answers or exploit partial matches, we construct an evaluationdataset SOCRATES (ShOrtCut-fRee lATent rEaSoning). We observe that LLMsdemonstrate promising latent multi-hop reasoning abilities without exploitingshortcuts, but only for certain types of queries. For queries requiring latentrecall of countries as the intermediate answer, the best models achieve 80%latent composability, but this drops to just 5% for the recall of years.Comparisons with Chain-of-Thought composability highlight a significant gapbetween the ability of models to reason latently versus explicitly. Analysisreveals that latent representations of the intermediate answer are constructedmore often in queries with higher latent composability, and shows the emergenceof latent multi-hop reasoning during pretraining.</description><author>Sohee Yang, Nora Kassner, Elena Gribovskaya, Sebastian Riedel, Mor Geva</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:59:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16679v1</guid></item><item><title>Reconstructing Hand-Held Objects in 3D from Images and Videos</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06507v3</link><description>Objects manipulated by the hand (i.e., manipulanda) are particularlychallenging to reconstruct from Internet videos. Not only does the hand occludemuch of the object, but also the object is often only visible in a small numberof image pixels. At the same time, two strong anchors emerge in this setting:(1) estimated 3D hands help disambiguate the location and scale of the object,and (2) the set of manipulanda is small relative to all possible objects. Withthese insights in mind, we present a scalable paradigm for hand-held objectreconstruction that builds on recent breakthroughs in large language/visionmodels and 3D object datasets. Given a monocular RGB video, we aim toreconstruct hand-held object geometry in 3D, over time. In order to obtain thebest performing single frame model, we first present MCC-Hand-Object (MCC-HO),which jointly reconstructs hand and object geometry given a single RGB imageand inferred 3D hand as inputs. Subsequently, we prompt a text-to-3D generativemodel using GPT-4(V) to retrieve a 3D object model that matches the object inthe image(s); we call this alignment Retrieval-Augmented Reconstruction (RAR).RAR provides unified object geometry across all frames, and the result isrigidly aligned with both the input images and 3D MCC-HO observations in atemporally consistent manner. Experiments demonstrate that our approachachieves state-of-the-art performance on lab and Internet image/video datasets.We make our code and models available on the project website:https://janehwu.github.io/mcc-ho</description><author>Jane Wu, Georgios Pavlakos, Georgia Gkioxari, Jitendra Malik</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:58:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06507v3</guid></item><item><title>Motion Code: Robust Time Series Classification and Forecasting via Sparse Variational Multi-Stochastic Processes Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14081v3</link><description>Despite extensive research, time series classification and forecasting onnoisy data remain highly challenging. The main difficulties lie in findingsuitable mathematical concepts to describe time series and effectively separatenoise from the true signals. Unlike traditional methods treating time series asstatic vectors or fixed sequences, we propose a novel framework that views eachtime series, regardless of length, as a realization of a continuous-timestochastic process. This mathematical approach captures dependencies acrosstimestamps and detects hidden, time-varying signals within the noise. However,real-world data often involves multiple distinct dynamics, making itinsufficient to model the entire process with a single stochastic model. Toaddress this, we assign each dynamic a unique signature vector and introducethe concept of "most informative timestamps" to infer a sparse approximation ofthe individual dynamics from these vectors. The resulting model, called MotionCode, includes parameters that fully capture diverse underlying dynamics in anintegrated manner, enabling simultaneous classification and forecasting of timeseries. Extensive experiments on noisy datasets, including real-worldParkinson's disease sensor tracking, demonstrate Motion Code's strongperformance against established benchmarks for time series classification andforecasting.</description><author>Chandrajit Bajaj, Minh Nguyen</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:57:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14081v3</guid></item><item><title>Is Hyper-Parameter Optimization Different for Software Analytics?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09622v3</link><description>Yes. SE data can have "smoother" boundaries between classes (compared totraditional AI data sets). To be more precise, the magnitude of the secondderivative of the loss function found in SE data is typically much smaller. Anew hyper-parameter optimizer, called SMOOTHIE, can exploit this idiosyncrasyof SE data. We compare SMOOTHIE and a state-of-the-art AI hyper-parameteroptimizer on three tasks: (a) GitHub issue lifetime prediction (b) detectingstatic code warnings false alarm; (c) defect prediction. For completeness, wealso show experiments on some standard AI datasets. SMOOTHIE runs faster andpredicts better on the SE data--but ties on non-SE data with the AI tool. Hencewe conclude that SE data can be different to other kinds of data; and thosedifferences mean that we should use different kinds of algorithms for our data.To support open science and other researchers working in this area, all ourscripts and datasets are available on-line athttps://github.com/yrahul3910/smoothness-hpo/.</description><author>Rahul Yedida, Tim Menzies</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:55:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09622v3</guid></item><item><title>Diffusion Features for Zero-Shot 6DoF Object Pose Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16668v1</link><description>Zero-shot object pose estimation enables the retrieval of object poses fromimages without necessitating object-specific training. In recent approachesthis is facilitated by vision foundation models (VFM), which are pre-trainedmodels that are effectively general-purpose feature extractors. Thecharacteristics exhibited by these VFMs vary depending on the training data,network architecture, and training paradigm. The prevailing choice in thisfield are self-supervised Vision Transformers (ViT). This study assesses theinfluence of Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) backbones on zero-shot poseestimation. In order to facilitate a comparison between the two families ofmodels on a common ground we adopt and modify a recent approach. Therefore, atemplate-based multi-staged method for estimating poses in a zero-shot fashionusing LDMs is presented. The efficacy of the proposed approach is empiricallyevaluated on three standard datasets for object-specific 6DoF pose estimation.The experiments demonstrate an Average Recall improvement of up to 27% over theViT baseline.

A generalized MOS algorithmmaintains a "frontier" of partial paths at each node and performs orderedprocessing to ensure that Pareto-optimal paths are generated to reach the goalnode. The algorithm becomes computationally intractable as the number ofobjectives increases due to a rapid increase in the non-dominated paths, andthe concomitantly large increase in Pareto-optimal solutions. While prior workshave focused on algorithmic methods to reduce the complexity, we tackle thischallenge by exploiting parallelism using an algorithm-architecture approach.The key insight is that MOS algorithms rely on the ordered execution of partialpaths to maintain high work efficiency. The OPMOS framework, proposed herein,unlocks ordered parallelism and efficiently exploits the concurrent executionof multiple paths in MOS. Experimental evaluation using the NVIDIA GH200Superchip shows the performance scaling potential of OPMOS on work efficiencyand parallelism using a real-world application to ship routing.</description><author>Leo Gold, Adam Bienkowski, David Sidoti, Krishna Pattipati, Omer Khan</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:53:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16667v1</guid></item><item><title>CatNet: Effective FDR Control in LSTM with Gaussian Mirrors and SHAP Feature Importance</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16666v1</link><description>We introduce CatNet, an algorithm that effectively controls False DiscoveryRate (FDR) and selects significant features in LSTM with the Gaussian Mirror(GM) method. To evaluate the feature importance of LSTM in time series, weintroduce a vector of the derivative of the SHapley Additive exPlanations(SHAP) to measure feature importance. We also propose a new kernel-baseddependence measure to avoid multicollinearity in the GM algorithm, to make arobust feature selection with controlled FDR. We use simulated data to evaluateCatNet's performance in both linear models and LSTM models with different linkfunctions. The algorithm effectively controls the FDR while maintaining a highstatistical power in all cases. We also evaluate the algorithm's performance indifferent low-dimensional and high-dimensional cases, demonstrating itsrobustness in various input dimensions. To evaluate CatNet's performance inreal world applications, we construct a multi-factor investment portfolio toforecast the prices of S\&amp;P 500 index components. The results demonstrate thatour model achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional LSTMmodels without feature selection and FDR control. Additionally, CatNeteffectively captures common market-driving features, which helps informeddecision-making in financial markets by enhancing the interpretability ofpredictions. Our study integrates of the Gaussian Mirror algorithm with LSTMmodels for the first time, and introduces SHAP values as a new featureimportance metric for FDR control methods, marking a significant advancement infeature selection and error control for neural networks.</description><author>Jiaan Han, Junxiao Chen, Yanzhe Fu</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:53:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16666v1</guid></item><item><title>Edge Weight Prediction For Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16665v1</link><description>Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) localizes keypoints across diverseobject categories with a single model, using one or a few annotated supportimages. Recent works have shown that using a pose graph (i.e., treatingkeypoints as nodes in a graph rather than isolated points) helps handleocclusions and break symmetry. However, these methods assume a static posegraph with equal-weight edges, leading to suboptimal results. We introduceEdgeCape, a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by predicting thegraph's edge weights which optimizes localization. To further leveragestructural priors, we propose integrating Markovian Structural Bias, whichmodulates the self-attention interaction between nodes based on the number ofhops between them. We show that this improves the model's ability to captureglobal spatial dependencies. Evaluated on the MP-100 benchmark, which includes100 categories and over 20K images, EdgeCape achieves state-of-the-art resultsin the 1-shot setting and leads among similar-sized methods in the 5-shotsetting, significantly improving keypoint localization accuracy.

SVG holds great potential for diversecontent creation in media and entertainment; however, it also presentssignificant challenges: (1) objects must exhibit a range of fine-grained,complex motions, (2) multiple objects need to appear consistently acrossscenes, and (3) subjects may require multiple motions with seamless transitionswithin a single scene. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRunner, anovel story-to-video generation method: First, we structure the input scriptusing a large language model (LLM) to facilitate both coarse-grained sceneplanning as well as fine-grained object-level layout and motion planning. Next,DreamRunner presents retrieval-augmented test-time adaptation to capture targetmotion priors for objects in each scene, supporting diverse motioncustomization based on retrieved videos, thus facilitating the generation ofnew videos with complex, scripted motions. Lastly, we propose a novelspatial-temporal region-based 3D attention and prior injection module SR3AI forfine-grained object-motion binding and frame-by-frame semantic control. Wecompare DreamRunner with various SVG baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-artperformance in character consistency, text alignment, and smooth transitions.Additionally, DreamRunner exhibits strong fine-grained condition-followingability in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly outperformingbaselines on T2V-ComBench. Finally, we validate DreamRunner's robust ability togenerate multi-object interactions with qualitative examples.</description><author>Zun Wang, Jialu Li, Han Lin, Jaehong Yoon, Mohit Bansal</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:41:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16657v1</guid></item><item><title>Enhancing Multimodal Medical Image Classification using Cross-Graph Modal Contrastive Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17494v2</link><description>The classification of medical images is a pivotal aspect of diseasediagnosis, often enhanced by deep learning techniques. However, traditionalapproaches typically focus on unimodal medical image data, neglecting theintegration of diverse non-image patient data. This paper proposes a novelCross-Graph Modal Contrastive Learning (CGMCL) framework for multimodal medicalimage classification. The model effectively integrates both image and non-imagedata by constructing cross-modality graphs and leveraging contrastive learningto align multimodal features in a shared latent space. An inter-modalityfeature scaling module further optimizes the representation learning process byreducing the gap between heterogeneous modalities. The proposed approach isevaluated on two datasets: a Parkinson's disease (PD) dataset and a publicmelanoma dataset. Results demonstrate that CGMCL outperforms conventionalunimodal methods in accuracy, interpretability, and early disease prediction.Additionally, the method shows superior performance in multi-class melanomaclassification. The CGMCL framework provides valuable insights into medicalimage classification while offering improved disease interpretability andpredictive capabilities.</description><author>Jun-En Ding, Chien-Chin Hsu, Feng Liu</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:35:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17494v2</guid></item><item><title>Self-Generated Critiques Boost Reward Modeling for Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16646v1</link><description>Reward modeling is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) withhuman preferences, especially in reinforcement learning from human feedback(RLHF). However, current reward models mainly produce scalar scores andstruggle to incorporate critiques in a natural language format. We hypothesizethat predicting both critiques and the scalar reward would improve rewardmodeling ability. Motivated by this, we propose Critic-RM, a framework thatimproves reward models using self-generated critiques without extrasupervision. Critic-RM employs a two-stage process: generating and filteringhigh-quality critiques, followed by joint fine-tuning on reward prediction andcritique generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Critic-RM improvesreward modeling accuracy by 3.7%-7.3% compared to standard reward models andLLM judges, demonstrating strong performance and data efficiency. Additionalstudies further validate the effectiveness of generated critiques in rectifyingflawed reasoning steps with 2.5%-3.2% gains in improving reasoning accuracy.</description><author>Yue Yu, Zhengxing Chen, Aston Zhang, Liang Tan, Chenguang Zhu, Richard Yuanzhe Pang, Yundi Qian, Xuewei Wang, Suchin Gururangan, Chao Zhang, Melanie Kambadur, Dhruv Mahajan, Rui Hou</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:28:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16646v1</guid></item><item><title>Recommender Systems for Good (RS4Good): Survey of Use Cases and a Call to Action for Research that Matters</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16645v1</link><description>In the area of recommender systems, the vast majority of research efforts isspent on developing increasingly sophisticated recommendation models, alsousing increasingly more computational resources. Unfortunately, most of theseresearch efforts target a very small set of application domains, mostlye-commerce and media recommendation. Furthermore, many of these models arenever evaluated with users, let alone put into practice. The scientific,economic and societal value of much of these efforts by scholars thereforeremains largely unclear. To achieve a stronger positive impact resulting fromthese efforts, we posit that we as a research community should more oftenaddress use cases where recommender systems contribute to societal good(RS4Good). In this opinion piece, we first discuss a number of examples wherethe use of recommender systems for problems of societal concern has beensuccessfully explored in the literature.

Flow matching is a recentlyproposed generative modeling framework that has achieved impressive performanceon a variety of tasks including those on biomolecular structures. The seminalflow matching framework was developed only for continuous data. However, denovo molecular design tasks require generating discrete data such as atomicelements or sequences of amino acid residues. Several discrete flow matchingmethods have been proposed recently to address this gap. In this work webenchmark the performance of existing discrete flow matching methods for 3D denovo small molecule generation and provide explanations of their differingbehavior. As a result we present FlowMol-CTMC, an open-source model thatachieves state of the art performance for 3D de novo design with fewerlearnable parameters than existing methods. Additionally, we propose the use ofmetrics that capture molecule quality beyond local chemical valency constraintsand towards higher-order structural motifs. These metrics show that even thoughbasic constraints are satisfied, the models tend to produce unusual andpotentially problematic functional groups outside of the training datadistribution.

A Critical Evaluation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16638v1</link><description>Modern LLMs can now produce highly readable abstractive summaries, to thepoint where traditional automated metrics for evaluating summary quality, suchas ROUGE, have become saturated. However, LLMs still sometimes introduceunwanted content into summaries, i.e., information inconsistent with orunsupported by their source. Measuring the occurrence of these often subtle``hallucinations'' automatically has proved to be challenging. This in turn hasmotivated development of a variety of metrics intended to measure the factualconsistency of generated summaries against their source. But are theseapproaches measuring what they purport to do? In this work, we stress-testautomatic factuality metrics. Specifically, we investigate whether and to whatdegree superficial attributes of summary texts suffice to predict``factuality'', finding that a (supervised) model using only such shallowfeatures is reasonably competitive with SOTA factuality scoring methods. Wethen evaluate how factuality metrics respond to factual corrections ininconsistent summaries and find that only a few show meaningful improvements.In contrast, some metrics are more sensitive to benign, non-factual edits.Motivated by these insights, we show that one can ``game'' (most) automaticfactuality metrics, i.e., reliably inflate ``factuality'' scores by appendinginnocuous sentences to generated summaries.Taken together, our results raisequestions about the degree to which we should rely on existing automatedfactuality metrics and what exactly we want ``factuality metrics'' to measure.</description><author>Sanjana Ramprasad, Byron C.

In this paper, a whole new task called Composed PersonRetrieval (CPR) is proposed to jointly utilize both image and text informationfor target person retrieval. However, the supervised CPR requires very costlymanual annotation dataset, while there are currently no available resources. Tomitigate this issue, we firstly introduce the Zero-shot Composed PersonRetrieval (ZS-CPR), which leverages existing domain-related data to resolve theCPR problem without expensive annotations. Secondly, to learn ZS-CPR model, wepropose a two-stage learning framework, Word4Per, where a lightweight TextualInversion Network (TINet) and a text-based person retrieval model based onfine-tuned Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) network are learnedwithout utilizing any CPR data. Thirdly, a finely annotated Image-Text ComposedPerson Retrieval (ITCPR) dataset is built as the benchmark to assess theperformance of the proposed Word4Per framework. Extensive experiments underboth Rank-1 and mAP demonstrate the effectiveness of Word4Per for the ZS-CPRtask, surpassing the comparative methods by over 10\%.

Recently, deeplearning (DL) methods have shown promise by directly mapping raw sinogram datato PET images. However, DL approaches that are regression-based or GAN-basedoften produce overly smoothed images or introduce various artifactsrespectively. Image-conditioned diffusion probabilistic models (cDPMs) areanother class of likelihood-based DL techniques capable of generating highlyrealistic and controllable images. While cDPMs have notable strengths, theystill face challenges such as maintain correspondence and consistency betweeninput and output images when they are from different domains (e.g., sinogramvs. image domain) as well as slow convergence rates. To address theselimitations, we introduce LegoPET, a hierarchical feature guided conditionaldiffusion model for high-perceptual quality PET image reconstruction fromsinograms. We conducted several experiments demonstrating that LegoPET not onlyimproves the performance of cDPMs but also surpasses recent DL-based PET imagereconstruction techniques in terms of visual quality and pixel-level PSNR/SSIMmetrics.

However, during inference, humansare often removed from the policy execution loop, limiting the ability to guidea pre-trained policy towards a specific sub-goal or trajectory shape amongmultiple predictions. Naive human intervention may inadvertently exacerbatedistribution shift, leading to constraint violations or execution failures. Tobetter align policy output with human intent without inducingout-of-distribution errors, we propose an Inference-Time Policy Steering (ITPS)framework that leverages human interactions to bias the generative samplingprocess, rather than fine-tuning the policy on interaction data. We evaluateITPS across three simulated and real-world benchmarks, testing three forms ofhuman interaction and associated alignment distance metrics. Among six samplingstrategies, our proposed stochastic sampling with diffusion policy achieves thebest trade-off between alignment and distribution shift.

In this paper, we present an analysis of the mosteffective architectures for the fusion of deep learning models for theprediction of company credit rating classes, by using structured andunstructured datasets of different types. In these models, we tested differentcombinations of fusion strategies with different deep learning models,including CNN, LSTM, GRU, and BERT. We studied data fusion strategies in termsof level (including early and intermediate fusion) and techniques (includingconcatenation and cross-attention). Our results show that a CNN-basedmulti-modal model with two fusion strategies outperformed other multi-modaltechniques. In addition, by comparing simple architectures with more complexones, we found that more sophisticated deep learning models do not necessarilyproduce the highest performance; however, if attention-based models areproducing the best results, cross-attention is necessary as a fusion strategy.Finally, our comparison of rating agencies on short-, medium-, and long-termperformance shows that Moody's credit ratings outperform those of otheragencies like Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Ratings.</description><author>Mahsa Tavakoli, Rohitash Chandra, Fengrui Tian, Cristián Bravo</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:03:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10740v3</guid></item><item><title>Imperceptible Adversarial Examples in the Physical World</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16622v1</link><description>Adversarial examples in the digital domain against deep learning-basedcomputer vision models allow for perturbations that are imperceptible to humaneyes. However, producing similar adversarial examples in the physical world hasbeen difficult due to the non-differentiable image distortion functions invisual sensing systems. The existing algorithms for generating physicallyrealizable adversarial examples often loosen their definition of adversarialexamples by allowing unbounded perturbations, resulting in obvious or evenstrange visual patterns. In this work, we make adversarial examplesimperceptible in the physical world using a straight-through estimator (STE,a.k.a. BPDA). We employ STE to overcome the non-differentiability -- applyingexact, non-differentiable distortions in the forward pass of thebackpropagation step, and using the identity function in the backward pass. Ourdifferentiable rendering extension to STE also enables imperceptibleadversarial patches in the physical world. Using printout photos, andexperiments in the CARLA simulator, we show that STE enables fast generation of$\ell_\infty$ bounded adversarial examples despite the non-differentiabledistortions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstratingimperceptible adversarial examples bounded by small $\ell_\infty$ norms in thephysical world that force zero classification accuracy in the globalperturbation threat model and cause near-zero ($4.22\%$) AP50 in objectdetection in the patch perturbation threat model.

A primary challengein this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visualand textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images intounified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semanticcorrespondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed.To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grainedinteractions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts.Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training(CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, topreliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided ImageRestoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entitiesto specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual andvisual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented tohandle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minordifferences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach isproposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, therebyavoiding excessive model attention to less significant information.

First, we construct the AI-GeneratedHuman activity Video Quality Assessment (Human-AGVQA) dataset, consisting of3,200 AGVs derived from 8 popular text-to-video (T2V) models using 400 textprompts that describe diverse human activities. We conduct a subjective studyto evaluate the human appearance quality, action continuity quality, andoverall video quality of AGVs, and identify semantic issues of human bodyparts. Based on Human-AGVQA, we benchmark the performance of T2V models andanalyze their strengths and weaknesses in generating different categories ofhuman activities. Second, we develop an objective evaluation metric, namedAI-Generated Human activity Video Quality metric (GHVQ), to automaticallyanalyze the quality of human activity AGVs. GHVQ systematically extractshuman-focused quality features, AI-generated content-aware quality features,and temporal continuity features, making it a comprehensive and explainablequality metric for human activity AGVs.

Theseexperiments are expensive, so one might hope to reduce their cost byexperimenting on a subset of the compounds, and predicting the outcomes of theremaining experiments. In this work, we model this scenario as a sequentialsubset selection problem: we aim to select the smallest set of candidates inorder to achieve some desired level of accuracy for the system as a whole. Ourkey observation is that, if there is heterogeneity in the difficulty of theprediction problem across the input space, selectively obtaining the labels forthe hardest examples in the acquisition pool will leave only the relativelyeasy examples to remain in the inference set, leading to better overall systemperformance. We call this mechanism inference set design, and propose the useof a confidence-based active learning solution to prune out these challengingexamples. Our algorithm includes an explicit stopping criterion that stopsrunning the experiments when it is sufficiently confident that the system hasreached the target performance.

Its robustness has been claimed to ensue from the reliance ondiffusion models (DMs) that project the AEs onto the natural distribution. Werevisit this claim, focusing on gradient-based strategies that back-propagatethe loss gradients through the defense, commonly referred to as ``adaptiveattacks". Analytically, we show that such an optimization method invalidatesDBP's core foundations, effectively targeting the DM rather than the classifierand restricting the purified outputs to a distribution over malicious samplesinstead. Thus, we reassess the reported empirical robustness, uncoveringimplementation flaws in the gradient back-propagation techniques used thus farfor DBP. We fix these issues, providing the first reliable gradient library forDBP and demonstrating how adaptive attacks drastically degrade its robustness.We then study a less efficient yet stricter majority-vote setting where theclassifier evaluates multiple purified copies of the input to make itsdecision. Here, DBP's stochasticity enables it to remain partially robustagainst traditional norm-bounded AEs. We propose a novel adaptation of a recentoptimization method against deepfake watermarking that crafts systemicmalicious perturbations while ensuring imperceptibility. When integrated withthe adaptive attack, it completely defeats DBP, even in the majority-votesetup.

However, traditionalmethods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judgingsubtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advancements inLarge Language Models (LLMs) inspire the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where LLMsare leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasksand applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-basedjudgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emergingfield. We begin by giving detailed definitions from both input and outputperspectives. Then we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy to exploreLLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where tojudge. Finally, we compile benchmarks for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge andhighlight key challenges and promising directions, aiming to provide valuableinsights and inspire future research in this promising research area.

We propose a novel FDD methodology forthe Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP), a widely used benchmark for chemicalprocess control. The model employs two separate Transformer branches, enablingindependent processing of input data and potential extraction of diverseinformation. A novel attention mechanism, Gated Dynamic Learnable Attention(GDLAttention), is introduced which integrates a gating mechanism and dynamiclearning capabilities. The gating mechanism modulates the attention weights,allowing the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input. Thedynamic learning approach adapts the attention strategy during training,potentially leading to improved performance. The attention mechanism uses abilinear similarity function, providing greater flexibility in capturingcomplex relationships between query and key vectors. In order to assess theeffectiveness of our approach, we tested it against 21 and 18 distinct faultscenarios in TEP, and compared its performance with several established FDDtechniques. The outcomes indicate that the method outperforms others in termsof accuracy, false alarm rate, and misclassification rate. This underscores therobustness and efficacy of the approach for FDD in intricate industrialprocesses.</description><author>Mohammad Ali Labbaf-Khaniki, Mohammad Manthouri, Hanieh Ajami</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:22:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10842v4</guid></item><item><title>Alpha Entropy Search for New Information-based Bayesian Optimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16586v1</link><description>Bayesian optimization (BO) methods based on information theory have obtainedstate-of-the-art results in several tasks. These techniques heavily rely on theKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to compute the acquisition function. In thiswork, we introduce a novel information-based class of acquisition functions forBO called Alpha Entropy Search (AES). AES is based on the {\alpha}-divergence,that generalizes the KL divergence. Iteratively, AES selects the nextevaluation point as the one whose associated target value has the highest levelof the dependency with respect to the location and associated value of theglobal maximum of the optimization problem. Dependency is measured in terms ofthe {\alpha}-divergence, as an alternative to the KL divergence. Intuitively,this favors the evaluation of the objective function at the most informativepoints about the global maximum. The {\alpha}-divergence has a free parameter{\alpha}, which determines the behavior of the divergence, trading-offevaluating differences between distributions at a single mode, and evaluatingdifferences globally. Therefore, different values of {\alpha} result indifferent acquisition functions. AES acquisition lacks a closed-formexpression. However, we propose an efficient and accurate approximation using atruncated Gaussian distribution. In practice, the value of {\alpha} can bechosen by the practitioner, but here we suggest to use a combination ofacquisition functions obtained by simultaneously considering a range of valuesof {\alpha}. We provide an implementation of AES in BOTorch and we evaluate itsperformance in both synthetic, benchmark and real-world experiments involvingthe tuning of the hyper-parameters of a deep neural network. These experimentsshow that the performance of AES is competitive with respect to otherinformation-based acquisition functions such as JES, MES or PES.</description><author>Daniel Fernández-Sánchez, Eduardo C.

Recent approaches address GRES by directlyextending the well-adopted RES frameworks with object-existence identification.However, these approaches tend to encode multi-granularity object informationinto a single representation, which makes it difficult to precisely representcomprehensive objects of different granularity. Moreover, the simple binaryobject-existence identification across all referent scenarios fails to specifytheir inherent differences, incurring ambiguity in object understanding. Totackle the above issues, we propose a \textbf{Co}unting-Aware\textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{D}ecoding framework (CoHD) for GRES. Bydecoupling the intricate referring semantics into different granularity with avisual-linguistic hierarchy, and dynamic aggregating it with intra- andinter-selection, CoHD boosts multi-granularity comprehension with thereciprocal benefit of the hierarchical nature. Furthermore, we incorporate thecounting ability by embodying multiple/single/non-target scenarios into count-and category-level supervision, facilitating comprehensive object perception.Experimental results on gRefCOCO, Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO benchmarksdemonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of CoHD which outperformsstate-of-the-art GRES methods by a remarkable margin.

However,the effectiveness of mechanisms like self-reflection and self-correctiondepends on the model's capacity to accurately assess its own performance, whichcan be limited by factors such as initial accuracy, question difficulty, andthe lack of external feedback. In this paper, we delve into a two-playerparadigm that separates the roles of reasoning and critique models, where thecritique model provides step-level feedback to supervise the reasoning (actor)model during both test-time and train-time. We first propose AutoMathCritique,an automated and scalable framework for collecting critique data, resulting ina dataset of $76,321$ responses paired with step-level feedback. Fine-tuninglanguage models with this dataset enables them to generate natural languagefeedback for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate that the critique modelsconsistently improve the actor's performance on difficult queries at test-time,especially when scaling up inference-time computation. Motivated by thesefindings, we introduce the critique-based supervision to the actor'sself-training process, and propose a critique-in-the-loop self-improvementmethod. Experiments show that the method improves the actor's explorationefficiency and solution diversity, especially on challenging queries, leadingto a stronger reasoning model. Lastly, we take the preliminary step to exploretraining self-talk reasoning models via critique supervision and showcase itspotential.

CSA mapsunimodal features into a multimodal space, using a new similarity score toretain only the multimodal information. CSA only involves the inference ofunimodal encoders and a cubic-complexity matrix decomposition, eliminating theneed for extensive GPU-based model training.

CSA surpasses the state-of-the-artmethod to map unimodal features to multimodal features.

However,VQ-based methods have inherent limitations. Representing continuous motion dataas limited discrete tokens leads to inevitable information loss, reduces thediversity of generated motions, and restricts their ability to functioneffectively as motion priors or generation guidance. In contrast, thecontinuous space generation nature of diffusion-based methods makes themwell-suited to address these limitations and with even potential for modelscalability. In this work, we systematically investigate why current VQ-basedmethods perform well and explore the limitations of existing diffusion-basedmethods from the perspective of motion data representation and distribution.Drawing on these insights, we preserve the inherent strengths of adiffusion-based human motion generation model and gradually optimize it withinspiration from VQ-based approaches. Our approach introduces a human motiondiffusion model enabled to perform bidirectional masked autoregression,optimized with a reformed data representation and distribution. Additionally,we also propose more robust evaluation methods to fairly assess different-basedmethods.

Business managers, algorithm designers, legalscholars, and regulators alike are all starting to consider the ramificationsof "algorithmic collusion." We study the emergent behavior of multi-armedbandit machine learning algorithms used in situations where agents arecompeting, but they have no information about the strategic interaction theyare engaged in. Using a general-form repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game, agentsengage in online learning with no prior model of game structure and noknowledge of competitors' states or actions (e.g., no observation of competingprices). We show that these context-free bandits, with no knowledge ofopponents' choices or outcomes, still will consistently learn collusivebehavior - what we call "naive collusion." We primarily study this systemthrough an analytical model and examine perturbations to the model throughsimulations. Our findings have several notable implications for regulators. First, callsto limit algorithms from conditioning on competitors' prices are insufficientto prevent algorithmic collusion. This is a direct result of collusion arisingeven in the naive setting. Second, symmetry in algorithms can increasecollusion potential. This highlights a new, simple mechanism for"hub-and-spoke" algorithmic collusion. A central distributor need not imbue itsalgorithm with supra-competitive tendencies for apparent collusion to arise; itcan simply arise by using certain (common) machine learning algorithms.Finally, we highlight that collusive outcomes depend starkly on the specificalgorithm being used, and we highlight market and algorithmic conditions underwhich it will be unknown a priori whether collusion occurs.</description><author>Connor Douglas, Foster Provost, Arun Sundararajan</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:58:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16574v1</guid></item><item><title>A Review of Mechanistic Models of Event Comprehension</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18992v2</link><description>This review examines theoretical assumptions and computational models ofevent comprehension, tracing the evolution from discourse comprehensiontheories to contemporary event cognition frameworks.

However, traditional TGRL methods,despite their effectiveness, often face significant computational challengesand inference delays due to the inefficient sampling of temporal neighbors.Conventional sampling methods typically involve backtracking through theinteraction history of each node. In this paper, we propose a novel TGRLframework, No-Looking-Back (NLB), which overcomes these challenges byintroducing a forward recent sampling strategy. This strategy eliminates theneed to backtrack through historical interactions by utilizing aGPU-executable, size-constrained hash table for each node. The hash tablerecords a down-sampled set of recent interactions, enabling rapid queryresponses with minimal inference latency. The maintenance of this hash table ishighly efficient, operating with $O(1)$ complexity. Fully compatible with GPUprocessing, NLB maximizes programmability, parallelism, and power efficiency.Empirical evaluations demonstrate that NLB not only matches or surpassesstate-of-the-art methods in accuracy for tasks like link prediction and nodeclassification across six real-world datasets but also achieves 1.32-4.40xfaster training, 1.2-7.94x greater energy efficiency, and 1.63-12.95x lowerinference latency compared to competitive baselines.

AddressingOut-Of-Distribution (OOD) driving scenarios is essential for enhancing safety,as OOD scenarios help validate the reliability of the models within thevehicle's autonomy stack. However, generating OOD scenarios is challenging dueto their long-tailed distribution and rarity in urban driving dataset.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in autonomousdriving, particularly for their zero-shot generalization and common-sensereasoning capabilities. In this paper, we leverage these LLM strengths tointroduce a framework for generating diverse OOD driving scenarios. Ourapproach uses LLMs to construct a branching tree, where each branch representsa unique OOD scenario. These scenarios are then simulated in the CARLAsimulator using an automated framework that aligns scene augmentation with thecorresponding textual descriptions. We evaluate our framework through extensivesimulations, and assess its performance via a diversity metric that measuresthe richness of the scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a new "OOD-ness"metric, which quantifies how much the generated scenarios deviate from typicalurban driving conditions. Furthermore, we explore the capacity of modernVision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and safely navigate through thesimulated OOD scenarios. Our findings offer valuable insights into thereliability of language models in addressing OOD scenarios within the contextof urban driving.</description><author>Erfan Aasi, Phat Nguyen, Shiva Sreeram, Guy Rosman, Sertac Karaman, Daniela Rus</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:38:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16554v1</guid></item><item><title>Representation Collapsing Problems in Vector Quantization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16550v1</link><description>Vector quantization is a technique in machine learning that discretizescontinuous representations into a set of discrete vectors. It is widelyemployed in tokenizing data representations for large language models,diffusion models, and other generative models. Despite its prevalence, thecharacteristics and behaviors of vector quantization in generative modelsremain largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate representationcollapse in vector quantization - a critical degradation where codebook tokensor latent embeddings lose their discriminative power by converging to a limitedsubset of values. This collapse fundamentally compromises the model's abilityto capture diverse data patterns. By leveraging both synthetic and realdatasets, we identify the severity of each type of collapses and triggeringconditions. Our analysis reveals that restricted initialization and limitedencoder capacity result in tokens collapse and embeddings collapse. Building onthese findings, we propose potential solutions aimed at mitigating eachcollapse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive studyexamining representation collapsing problems in vector quantization.</description><author>Wenhao Zhao, Qiran Zou, Rushi Shah, Dianbo Liu</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:32:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16550v1</guid></item><item><title>Transformers are Deep Optimizers: Provable In-Context Learning for Deep Model Training</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16549v1</link><description>We investigate the transformer's capability for in-context learning (ICL) tosimulate the training process of deep models.

Recent effortshave replaced this norm with a structural sparsity regularizer, such as thenuclear group norm, to craft group-wise sparse adversarial attacks. Theresulting perturbations are thus explainable and hold significant practicalrelevance, shedding light on an even greater vulnerability of DNNs. However,crafting such attacks poses an optimization challenge, as it involves computingnorms for groups of pixels within a non-convex objective. We address this bypresenting a two-phase algorithm that generates group-wise sparse attackswithin semantically meaningful areas of an image. Initially, we optimize aquasinorm adversarial loss using the $1/2-$quasinorm proximal operator tailoredfor non-convex programming. Subsequently, the algorithm transitions to aprojected Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent with $2-$norm regularizationapplied to perturbation magnitudes. Rigorous evaluations on CIFAR-10 andImageNet datasets demonstrate a remarkable increase in group-wise sparsity,e.g., $50.9\%$ on CIFAR-10 and $38.4\%$ on ImageNet (average case, targetedattack). This performance improvement is accompanied by significantly fastercomputation times, improved explainability, and a $100\%$ attack success rate.</description><author>Shpresim Sadiku, Moritz Wagner, Sebastian Pokutta</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:23:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17434v3</guid></item><item><title>RoboSpatial: Teaching Spatial Understanding to 2D and 3D Vision-Language Models for Robotics</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16537v1</link><description>Spatial understanding is a crucial capability for robots to make groundeddecisions based on their environment. This foundational skill enables robotsnot only to perceive their surroundings but also to reason about and interactmeaningfully within the world. In modern robotics, these capabilities are takenon by visual language models, and they face significant challenges when appliedto spatial reasoning context due to their training data sources. These sourcesutilize general-purpose image datasets, and they often lack sophisticatedspatial scene understanding capabilities. For example, the datasets do notaddress reference frame comprehension - spatial relationships require clearcontextual understanding, whether from an ego-centric, object-centric, orworld-centric perspective, which allow for effective real-world interaction. Toaddress this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale spatialunderstanding dataset consisting of real indoor and tabletop scenes captured as3D scans and egocentric images, annotated with rich spatial informationrelevant to robotics.

We attribute thisto the "domain expert-AI-conundrum": while domain experts, such as clinicianscientists, should be able to build predictive models such as risk scores, theyface substantial barriers in accessing state-of-the-art (SOTA) tools. Whileautomated machine learning (AutoML) has been proposed as a partner in clinicalpredictive modeling, many additional requirements need to be fulfilled to makemachine learning accessible for clinician scientists. To address this gap, we introduce CliMB, a no-code AI-enabled partnerdesigned to empower clinician scientists to create predictive models usingnatural language. CliMB guides clinician scientists through the entire medicaldata science pipeline, thus empowering them to create predictive models fromreal-world data in just one conversation. CliMB also creates structured reportsand interpretable visuals. In evaluations involving clinician scientists andsystematic comparisons against a baseline GPT-4, CliMB consistentlydemonstrated superior performance in key areas such as planning, errorprevention, code execution, and model performance. Moreover, in blindedassessments involving 45 clinicians from diverse specialties and career stages,more than 80% preferred CliMB over GPT-4. Overall, by providing a no-codeinterface with clear guidance and access to SOTA methods in the fields ofdata-centric AI, AutoML, and interpretable ML, CliMB empowers clinicianscientists to build robust predictive models.

This problem space includes: (1)addressing catastrophic forgetting to retain previously learned tasks, (2)demonstrating positive forward transfer for faster learning, (3) ensuringscalability across numerous tasks, and (4) facilitating learning withoutrequiring task labels, even in the absence of clear task boundaries. In thispaper, the Task-Agnostic Policy Distillation (TAPD) framework is introduced.This framework alleviates problems (1)-(4) by incorporating a task-agnosticphase, where an agent explores its environment without any external goal andmaximizes only its intrinsic motivation. The knowledge gained during this phaseis later distilled for further exploration. Therefore, the agent acts in aself-supervised manner by systematically seeking novel states. By utilizingtask-agnostic distilled knowledge, the agent can solve downstream tasks moreefficiently, leading to improved sample efficiency.

Our key contributions are prompt tuning on\textit{single-head} transformers with only a \textit{single} self-attentionlayer: (i) is universal, and (ii) supports efficient (even almost-linear time)algorithms under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). Statistically,we prove that prompt tuning on such simplest possible transformers areuniversal approximators for sequence-to-sequence Lipschitz functions. Inaddition, we provide an exponential-in-$dL$ and -in-$(1/\epsilon)$ lower boundon the required soft-prompt tokens for prompt tuning to memorize any datasetwith 1-layer, 1-head transformers. Computationally, we identify a phasetransition in the efficiency of prompt tuning, determined by the norm of the\textit{soft-prompt-induced} keys and queries, and provide an upper boundcriterion. Beyond this criterion, no sub-quadratic (efficient) algorithm forprompt tuning exists under SETH. Within this criterion, we showcase our theoryby proving the existence of almost-linear time prompt tuning inferencealgorithms.

We challenge theassumption that these latent features ought to be high-dimensional vectorswhich require model fine tuning to handle. Here we propose Label BoostedRetrieval Augmented Generation (LaB-RAG), a text-based approach to imagecaptioning that leverages image descriptors in the form of categorical labelsto boost standard retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with pretrained largelanguage models (LLMs). We study our method in the context of radiology reportgeneration (RRG), where the task is to generate a clinician's report detailingtheir observations from a set of radiological images, such as X-rays. We arguethat simple linear classifiers over extracted image embeddings can effectivelytransform X-rays into text-space as radiology-specific labels. In combinationwith standard RAG, we show that these derived text labels can be used withgeneral-domain LLMs to generate radiology reports. Without ever training ourgenerative language model or image feature encoder models, and without everdirectly "showing" the LLM an X-ray, we demonstrate that LaB-RAG achievesbetter results across natural language and radiology language metrics comparedwith other retrieval-based RRG methods, while attaining competitive resultscompared to other fine-tuned vision-language RRG models. We further presentresults of our experiments with various components of LaB-RAG to betterunderstand our method. Finally, we critique the use of a popular RRG metric,arguing it is possible to artificially inflate its results without truedata-leakage.</description><author>Steven Song, Anirudh Subramanyam, Irene Madejski, Robert L.

However, the diversity of tissue samples and thenecessity for meticulous image labeling often result in biased datasets,constraining the applicability of algorithms trained on them. To harnesssynthetic histopathological images to cope with this challenge, it is essentialnot only to produce photorealistic images but also to be able to exert controlover the cellular characteristics they depict. Previous studies used methods togenerate, from random noise, semantic masks that captured the spatialdistribution of the tissue. These masks were then used as a prior forconditional generative approaches to produce photorealistic histopathologicalimages. However, as with many other generative models, this solution exhibitsmode collapse as the model fails to capture the full diversity of theunderlying data distribution. In this work, we present a pipeline, coinedPriorPath, that generates detailed, realistic, semantic masks derived fromcoarse-grained images delineating tissue regions. This approach enables controlover the spatial arrangement of the generated masks and, consequently, theresulting synthetic images. We demonstrated the efficacy of our method acrossthree cancer types, skin, prostate, and lung, showcasing PriorPath's capabilityto cover the semantic mask space and to provide better similarity to real maskscompared to previous methods.

LATUP-Net achievespromising segmentation performance: the average Dice scores for the wholetumor, tumor core, and enhancing tumor on the BraTS 2020 dataset are 88.41%,83.82%, and 73.67%, and on the BraTS 2021 dataset, they are 90.29%, 89.54%, and83.92%, respectively. Hausdorff distance metrics further indicate its improvedability to delineate tumor boundaries. With its significantly reducedcomputational demand using only 3.07M parameters, about 59 times fewer thanother state-of-the-art models, and running on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX306012GB GPU, LATUP-Net requires just 15.79 GFLOPs.

In the proposed scenario, users contain a localdataset and communicate only with their immediate neighbours, with the aim offinding a clustering of the full, joint data. The proposed family, termedDistributed Gradient Clustering (DGC-$\mathcal{F}_\rho$), is parametrized by$\rho \geq 1$, controling the proximity of users' center estimates, with$\mathcal{F}$ determining the clustering loss. Our framework allows for a broadclass of smooth convex loss functions, including popular clustering losses like$K$-means and Huber loss. Specialized to popular clustering losses like$K$-means and Huber loss, DGC-$\mathcal{F}_\rho$ gives rise to noveldistributed clustering algorithms DGC-KM$_\rho$ and DGC-HL$_\rho$, while novelclustering losses based on Logistic and Fair functions lead to DGC-LL$_\rho$and DGC-FL$_\rho$. We provide a unified analysis and establish several strongresults, under mild assumptions. First, we show that the sequence of centersgenerated by the methods converges to a well-defined notion of fixed point,under any center initialization and value of $\rho$. Second, we prove that, as$\rho$ increases, the family of fixed points produced by DGC-$\mathcal{F}_\rho$converges to a notion of consensus fixed points. We show that consensus fixedpoints of DGC-$\mathcal{F}_{\rho}$ are equivalent to fixed points of gradientclustering over the full data, guaranteeing a clustering of the full data isproduced. For the special case of Bregman losses, we show that our fixed pointsconverge to the set of Lloyd points.

A latest approach, InitNo, refines theinitial noisy latent by leveraging attention maps; however, these maps captureonly limited information, and the effectiveness of InitNo is highly dependenton the initial starting point, as it tends to converge on a local optimum nearthis point. To this end, this paper proposes leveraging the languagecomprehension capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to guide theoptimization of the initial noisy latent, and introduces the Noise Diffusionprocess, which updates the noisy latent to generate semantically faithfulimages while preserving distribution consistency. Furthermore, we provide atheoretical analysis of the condition under which the update improves semanticfaithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness andadaptability of our framework, consistently enhancing semantic alignment acrossvarious diffusion models.

However, the mechanisms by whichthese models integrate and prioritize different data modalities, includingimages and text, remain poorly understood. Here, using a diverse collection of1014 multimodal medical cases, we evaluate the unimodal and multimodal imageinterpretation abilities of proprietary (GPT-4, Gemini Pro 1.0) and open-source(Llama-3.2-90B, LLaVA-Med-v1.5) multimodal foundational models with and withoutthe use of text descriptions. Across all models, image predictions were largelydriven by exploiting text, with accuracy increasing monotonically with theamount of informative text. By contrast, human performance on medical imageinterpretation did not improve with informative text. Exploitation of text is adouble-edged sword; we show that even mild suggestions of an incorrectdiagnosis in text diminishes image-based classification, reducing performancedramatically in cases the model could previously answer with images alone.Finally, we conducted a physician evaluation of model performance on long-formmedical cases, finding that the provision of images either reduced or had noeffect on model performance when text is already highly informative. Ourresults suggest that multimodal AI models may be useful in medical diagnosticreasoning but that their accuracy is largely driven, for better and worse, bytheir exploitation of text.</description><author>Thomas Buckley, James A.

RMs approximate humanpreferences over possible LLM responses to the same prompt by predicting andcomparing reward scores. However, as they are typically modified versions ofLLMs with scalar output heads, RMs are large black boxes whose predictions arenot explainable. More transparent RMs would enable improved trust in thealignment of LLMs. In this work, we propose to use contrastive explanations toexplain any binary response comparison made by an RM. Specifically, we generatea diverse set of new comparisons similar to the original one to characterisethe RM's local behaviour. The perturbed responses forming the new comparisonsare generated to explicitly modify manually specified high-level evaluationattributes, on which analyses of RM behaviour are grounded. In quantitativeexperiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method for findinghigh-quality contrastive explanations. We then showcase the qualitativeusefulness of our method for investigating global sensitivity of RMs to eachevaluation attribute, and demonstrate how representative examples can beautomatically extracted to explain and compare behaviours of different RMs. Wesee our method as a flexible framework for RM explanation, providing a basisfor more interpretable and trustworthy LLM alignment.</description><author>Junqi Jiang, Tom Bewley, Saumitra Mishra, Freddy Lecue, Manuela Veloso</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 15:37:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16502v1</guid></item><item><title>@Bench: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models for Human-centered Assistive Technology</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14215v2</link><description>As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advance, human-centered AssistiveTechnologies (ATs) for helping People with Visual Impairments (PVIs) areevolving into generalists, capable of performing multiple tasks simultaneously.However, benchmarking VLMs for ATs remains under-explored.

Atypical solution is to employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) coupled withchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which decomposes complex questions intochain-like sub-questions and applies iterative RAG at each sub-question.However, prior works exhibit sub-optimal reasoning planning and overlookdynamic knowledge retrieval from heterogeneous sources. In this paper, wepropose AtomR, a novel heterogeneous knowledge reasoning framework thatconducts multi-source reasoning at the atomic level. Drawing inspiration fromthe graph modeling of knowledge, AtomR leverages large language models (LLMs)to decompose complex questions into combinations of three atomic knowledgeoperators, significantly enhancing the reasoning process at both the planningand execution stages.

Real-world online videos are oftenplagued by degradations such as blurring and quantization noise, due to thehigh compression ratio caused by high communication costs and limitedtransmission bandwidth. These degradations have a particularly serious impacton face videos because the human visual system is highly sensitive to facialdetails. Despite the significant advancement in video face enhancement, currentmethods still suffer from $i)$ long processing time and $ii)$ inconsistentspatial-temporal visual effects (e.g., flickering). This study proposes a noveland efficient blind video face enhancement method to overcome the above twochallenges, restoring high-quality videos from their compressed low-qualityversions with an effective de-flickering mechanism. In particular, the proposedmethod develops upon a 3D-VQGAN backbone associated with spatial-temporalcodebooks recording high-quality portrait features and residual-based temporalinformation. We develop a two-stage learning framework for the model. In Stage\Rmnum{1}, we learn the model with a regularizer mitigating the codebookcollapse problem. In Stage \Rmnum{2}, we learn two transformers to lookup codefrom the codebooks and further update the encoder of low-quality videos.Experiments conducted on the VFHQ-Test dataset demonstrate that our methodsurpasses the current state-of-the-art blind face video restoration andde-flickering methods on both efficiency and effectiveness.

Modern deep reinforcementlearning (DRL) explores a computational approach to learning from interactionand has made significant progress in solving various tasks. However, despiteits power, DRL still falls short of biological agents in terms of energyefficiency. Although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, webelieve that the integration of spiking communication between neurons andbiologically-plausible synaptic plasticity plays a prominent role in achievinggreater energy efficiency. Following this biological intuition, we optimized aspiking policy network (SPN) using a genetic algorithm as an energy-efficientalternative to DRL. Our SPN mimics the sensorimotor neuron pathway of insectsand communicates through event-based spikes. Inspired by biological researchshowing that the brain forms memories by creating new synaptic connections andrewiring these connections based on new experiences, we tuned the synapticconnections instead of weights in the SPN to solve given tasks. Experimentalresults on several robotic control tasks demonstrate that our method canachieve the same level of performance as mainstream DRL methods whileexhibiting significantly higher energy efficiency.</description><author>Duzhen Zhang, Tielin Zhang, Shuncheng Jia, Qingyu Wang, Bo Xu</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 15:11:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10292v2</guid></item><item><title>A Gaussian Process Model for Ordinal Data with Applications to Chemoinformatics</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09989v2</link><description>With the proliferation of screening tools for chemical testing, it is nowpossible to create vast databases of chemicals easily.

A novel aspect of our model is thatthe kernel contains a scaling parameter, a feature not previously examined inthe literature, that controls the strength of the correlation between elementsof the chemical space. Using molecular fingerprints, a numerical representationof a compound's location within the chemical space, we find that accounting forcorrelation amongst chemical compounds improves predictive performance over theuncorrelated model, where effects are assumed to be independent.
