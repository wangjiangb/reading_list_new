Existing generalization techniques necessitate substantial dataaugmentation, potentially sourced from external datasets, and aim at learninginvariant representations by imposing various alignment constraints.Large-scale pretraining has recently shown promising generalizationcapabilities, along with the potential of bridging different modalities. Forinstance, the recent advent of vision-language models like CLIP has opened thedoorway for vision models to exploit the textual modality. In this paper, weintroduce a simple framework for generalizing semantic segmentation networks byemploying language as the source of randomization. Our recipe comprises threekey ingredients: i) the preservation of the intrinsic CLIP robustness throughminimal fine-tuning, ii) language-driven local style augmentation, and iii)randomization by locally mixing the source and augmented styles duringtraining. Extensive experiments report state-of-the-art results on variousgeneralization benchmarks. The code will be made available.</description><author>Mohammad Fahes, Tuan-Hung Vu, Andrei Bursuc, Patrick Pérez, Raoul de Charette</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 18:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17922v1</guid></item><item><title>Visual Anagrams: Generating Multi-View Optical Illusions with Diffusion Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17919v1</link><description>We address the problem of synthesizing multi-view optical illusions: imagesthat change appearance upon a transformation, such as a flip or rotation. Wepropose a simple, zero-shot method for obtaining these illusions fromoff-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion models. During the reverse diffusionprocess, we estimate the noise from different views of a noisy image. We thencombine these noise estimates together and denoise the image. A theoreticalanalysis suggests that this method works precisely for views that can bewritten as orthogonal transformations, of which permutations are a subset. Thisleads to the idea of a visual anagram--an image that changes appearance undersome rearrangement of pixels. This includes rotations and flips, but also moreexotic pixel permutations such as a jigsaw rearrangement. Our approach alsonaturally extends to illusions with more than two views. We provide bothqualitative and quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness andflexibility of our method.

We identify diffusion models, a state-of-the-art method forgenerative tasks, as a prime candidate. Such models involve training a U-Net toiteratively predict and remove noise, and the resulting model can synthesizehigh-fidelity, diverse, novel images. We find that the intermediate featuremaps of the U-Net are diverse, discriminative feature representations. Wepropose a novel attention mechanism for pooling feature maps and furtherleverage this mechanism as DifFormer, a transformer feature fusion of featuresfrom different diffusion U-Net blocks and noise steps. We also develop DifFeed,a novel feedback mechanism tailored to diffusion. We find that diffusion modelsare better than GANs, and, with our fusion and feedback mechanisms, can competewith state-of-the-art unsupervised image representation learning methods fordiscriminative tasks - image classification with full and semi-supervision,transfer for fine-grained classification, object detection and segmentation,and semantic segmentation.

Existing text-to-avatar methods are either limitedto static avatars which cannot be animated or struggle to generate animatableavatars with promising quality and precise pose control. To address theselimitations, we propose AvatarStudio, a coarse-to-fine generative model thatgenerates explicit textured 3D meshes for animatable human avatars.Specifically, AvatarStudio begins with a low-resolution NeRF-basedrepresentation for coarse generation, followed by incorporating SMPL-guidedarticulation into the explicit mesh representation to support avatar animationand high resolution rendering. To ensure view consistency and posecontrollability of the resulting avatars, we introduce a 2D diffusion modelconditioned on DensePose for Score Distillation Sampling supervision. Byeffectively leveraging the synergy between the articulated mesh representationand the DensePose-conditional diffusion model, AvatarStudio can createhigh-quality avatars from text that are ready for animation, significantlyoutperforming previous methods. Moreover, it is competent for manyapplications, e.g., multimodal avatar animations and style-guided avatarcreation.

Existing solution approaches can handle unstructuredLDAS with up to a few million actions. However, many real-world applications inlogistics, production, and transportation systems have combinatorial actionspaces, whose size grows well beyond millions of actions, even on smallinstances. Fortunately, such action spaces exhibit structure, e.g., equallyspaced discrete resource units. With this work, we focus on handling structuredLDAS (SLDAS) with sizes that cannot be handled by current benchmarks: wepropose Dynamic Neighborhood Construction (DNC), a novel exploitation paradigmfor SLDAS. We present a scalable neighborhood exploration heuristic thatutilizes this paradigm and efficiently explores the discrete neighborhoodaround the continuous proxy action in structured action spaces with up to$10^{73}$ actions. We demonstrate the performance of our method by benchmarkingit against three state-of-the-art approaches designed for large discrete actionspaces across two distinct environments. Our results show that DNC matches oroutperforms state-of-the-art approaches while being computationally moreefficient. Furthermore, our method scales to action spaces that so far remainedcomputationally intractable for existing methodologies.</description><author>Fabian Akkerman, Julius Luy, Wouter van Heeswijk, Maximilian Schiffer</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 18:58:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19891v3</guid></item><item><title>Algorithmic Assistance with Recommendation-Dependent Preferences</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07626v2</link><description>When we use algorithms to produce risk assessments, we typically think ofthese predictions as providing helpful input to human decisions, such as whenrisk scores are presented to judges or doctors. But when a decision-makerobtains algorithmic assistance, they may not only react to the information. Thedecision-maker may view the input of the algorithm as recommending a defaultaction, making it costly for them to deviate, such as when a judge is reluctantto overrule a high-risk assessment of a defendant or a doctor fears theconsequences of deviating from recommended procedures. In this article, wepropose a principal-agent model of joint human-machine decision-making. Withinthis model, we consider the effect and design of algorithmic recommendationswhen they affect choices not just by shifting beliefs, but also by alteringpreferences. We motivate this assumption from institutional factors, such as adesire to avoid audits, as well as from well-established models in behavioralscience that predict loss aversion relative to a reference point, which here isset by the algorithm. We show that recommendation-dependent preferences createinefficiencies where the decision-maker is overly responsive to therecommendation. As a potential remedy, we discuss algorithms that strategicallywithhold recommendations, and show how they can improve the quality of finaldecisions.</description><author>Bryce McLaughlin, Jann Spiess</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 18:57:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07626v2</guid></item><item><title>OPERA: Alleviating Hallucination in Multi-Modal Large Language Models via Over-Trust Penalty and Retrospection-Allocation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17911v1</link><description>Hallucination, posed as a pervasive challenge of multi-modal large languagemodels (MLLMs), has significantly impeded their real-world usage that demandsprecise judgment. Existing methods mitigate this issue with either trainingwith specific designed data or inferencing with external knowledge from othersources, incurring inevitable additional costs. In this paper, we presentOPERA, a novel MLLM decoding method grounded in an Over-trust Penalty and aRetrospection-Allocation strategy, serving as a nearly free lunch to alleviatethe hallucination issue without additional data, knowledge, or training. Ourapproach begins with an interesting observation that, most hallucinations areclosely tied to the knowledge aggregation patterns manifested in theself-attention matrix, i.e., MLLMs tend to generate new tokens by focusing on afew summary tokens, but not all the previous tokens. Such partial over-trustinclination results in the neglecting of image tokens and describes the imagecontent with hallucination. Statistically, we observe an 80%$\sim$95%co-currency rate between hallucination contents and such knowledge aggregationpatterns. Based on the observation, OPERA introduces a penalty term on themodel logits during the beam-search decoding to mitigate the over-trust issue,along with a rollback strategy that retrospects the presence of summary tokensin the previously generated tokens, and re-allocate the token selection ifnecessary. With extensive experiments, OPERA shows significanthallucination-mitigating performance on different MLLMs and metrics, provingits effectiveness and generality.

While these methods demonstrate state-of-the-artquality and speed, they are designed for photogrammetry of static scenes and donot generalize well to freely moving humans in the environment. In this work,we introduce Human Gaussian Splats (HUGS) that represents an animatable humantogether with the scene using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method takesonly a monocular video with a small number of (50-100) frames, and itautomatically learns to disentangle the static scene and a fully animatablehuman avatar within 30 minutes. We utilize the SMPL body model to initializethe human Gaussians. To capture details that are not modeled by SMPL (e.g.cloth, hairs), we allow the 3D Gaussians to deviate from the human body model.Utilizing 3D Gaussians for animated humans brings new challenges, including theartifacts created when articulating the Gaussians. We propose to jointlyoptimize the linear blend skinning weights to coordinate the movements ofindividual Gaussians during animation. Our approach enables novel-posesynthesis of human and novel view synthesis of both the human and the scene.

Recently, these models have been shown to provide useful guidancefor the generation of 3D graphics assets. However, existing work intext-conditioned 3D generation faces fundamental constraints: (i) inability togenerate detailed, multi-object scenes, (ii) inability to textually controlmulti-object configurations, and (iii) physically realistic scene composition.In this work, we propose CG3D, a method for compositionally generating scalable3D assets that resolves these constraints. We find that explicit Gaussianradiance fields, parameterized to allow for compositions of objects, possessthe capability to enable semantically and physically consistent scenes. Byutilizing a guidance framework built around this explicit representation, weshow state of the art results, capable of even exceeding the guiding diffusionmodel in terms of object combinations and physics accuracy.</description><author>Alexander Vilesov, Pradyumna Chari, Achuta Kadambi</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 18:55:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17907v1</guid></item><item><title>Language-conditioned Detection Transformer</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17902v1</link><description>We present a new open-vocabulary detection framework. Our framework uses bothimage-level labels and detailed detection annotations when available. Ourframework proceeds in three steps. We first train a language-conditioned objectdetector on fully-supervised detection data. This detector gets to see thepresence or absence of ground truth classes during training, and conditionsprediction on the set of present classes. We use this detector to pseudo-labelimages with image-level labels. Our detector provides much more accuratepseudo-labels than prior approaches with its conditioning mechanism. Finally,we train an unconditioned open-vocabulary detector on the pseudo-annotatedimages. The resulting detector, named DECOLA, shows strong zero-shotperformance in open-vocabulary LVIS benchmark as well as direct zero-shottransfer benchmarks on LVIS, COCO, Object365, and OpenImages. DECOLAoutperforms the prior arts by 17.1 AP-rare and 9.4 mAP on zero-shot LVISbenchmark. DECOLA achieves state-of-the-art results in various model sizes,architectures, and datasets by only training on open-sourced data andacademic-scale computing.

The model incorporates an image encoder, whichdistills a source view into a compact representation, that, in turn, guides thegeneration of related novel views. We show that by imposing a tight bottleneckbetween the encoder and a denoising decoder, and leveraging novel viewsynthesis as a self-supervised objective, we can turn diffusion models intostrong representation learners, capable of capturing visual semantics in anunsupervised manner. To the best of our knowledge, SODA is the first diffusionmodel to succeed at ImageNet linear-probe classification, and, at the sametime, it accomplishes reconstruction, editing and synthesis tasks across a widerange of datasets. Further investigation reveals the disentangled nature of itsemergent latent space, that serves as an effective interface to control andmanipulate the model's produced images. All in all, we aim to shed light on theexciting and promising potential of diffusion models, not only for imagegeneration, but also for learning rich and robust representations.</description><author>Drew A.

A prevalent strategy to align multiple modalities is to fine-tune thegenerator with a large number of annotated text-image pairs. However, such aprocedure is labor-consuming and resource-draining. The key question we ask is:can we enhance the quality and faithfulness of text-driven generative modelsbeyond extensive text-image pair annotations? To address this question, wepropose Knowledge Pursuit Prompting (KPP), a zero-shot framework thatiteratively incorporates external knowledge to help generators produce reliablevisual content. Instead of training generators to handle generic prompts, KPPemploys a recursive knowledge query process to gather informative externalfacts from the knowledge base, instructs a language model to compress theacquired knowledge for prompt refinement, and utilizes text-driven generatorsfor visual synthesis. The entire process is zero-shot, without accessing thearchitectures and parameters of generative models. We evaluate the frameworkacross multiple text-driven generative tasks (image, 3D rendering, and video)on datasets of different domains. We further demonstrate the extensibility andadaptability of KPP through varying foundation model bases and instructions.Our results show that KPP is capable of generating faithful and semanticallyrich content across diverse visual domains, offering a promising solution toimprove multimodal generative models.</description><author>Jinqi Luo, Kwan Ho Ryan Chan, Dimitris Dimos, René Vidal</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 18:51:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17898v1</guid></item><item><title>Betrayed by Attention: A Simple yet Effective Approach for Self-supervised Video Object Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17893v1</link><description>In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for self-supervisedvideo object segmentation (VOS). Our key insight is that the inherentstructural dependencies present in DINO-pretrained Transformers can beleveraged to establish robust spatio-temporal correspondences in videos.Furthermore, simple clustering on this correspondence cue is sufficient toyield competitive segmentation results. Previous self-supervised VOS techniquesmajorly resort to auxiliary modalities or utilize iterative slot attention toassist in object discovery, which restricts their general applicability andimposes higher computational requirements. To deal with these challenges, wedevelop a simplified architecture that capitalizes on the emerging objectnessfrom DINO-pretrained Transformers, bypassing the need for additional modalitiesor slot attention. Specifically, we first introduce a single spatio-temporalTransformer block to process the frame-wise DINO features and establishspatio-temporal dependencies in the form of self-attention. Subsequently,utilizing these attention maps, we implement hierarchical clustering togenerate object segmentation masks. To train the spatio-temporal block in afully self-supervised manner, we employ semantic and dynamic motion consistencycoupled with entropy normalization. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-artperformance across multiple unsupervised VOS benchmarks and particularly excelsin complex real-world multi-object video segmentation tasks such asDAVIS-17-Unsupervised and YouTube-VIS-19.

DisCoCirc represents natural language text as a `circuit' thatcaptures the core semantic information of the text. These circuits can then beinterpreted as modular machine learning models. Additionally, DisCoCirc fulfilsanother major aim of providing an NLP model that can be implemented onnear-term quantum computers. In this paper we describe a software pipeline that converts English text toits DisCoCirc representation. The pipeline achieves coverage over a largefragment of the English language. It relies on Combinatory Categorial Grammar(CCG) parses of the input text as well as coreference resolution information.This semantic and syntactic information is used in several steps to convert thetext into a simply-typed $\lambda$-calculus term, and then into a circuitdiagram. This pipeline will enable the application of the DisCoCirc frameworkto NLP tasks, using both classical and quantum approaches.</description><author>Jonathon Liu, Razin A.

Thisrestriction becomes particularly challenging when dealing with novel objectsdue to the lack of relevant training data. To address this limitation, category-agnostic pose estimation (CAPE) wasintroduced. CAPE aims to enable keypoint localization for arbitrary objectcategories using a single model, requiring minimal support images withannotated keypoints. This approach not only enables object pose generationbased on arbitrary keypoint definitions but also significantly reduces theassociated costs, paving the way for versatile and adaptable pose estimationapplications. We present a novel approach to CAPE that leverages the inherent geometricalrelations between keypoints through a newly designed Graph Transformer Decoder.By capturing and incorporating this crucial structural information, our methodenhances the accuracy of keypoint localization, marking a significant departurefrom conventional CAPE techniques that treat keypoints as isolated entities. We validate our approach on the MP-100 benchmark, a comprehensive datasetcomprising over 20,000 images spanning more than 100 categories. Our methodoutperforms the prior state-of-the-art by substantial margins, achievingremarkable improvements of 2.16% and 1.82% under 1-shot and 5-shot settings,respectively.

Recently, various studies haveachieved promising results. However, most studies assume the predictionlocations have complete or at least partial historical records and cannot beextended to non-historical recorded locations. In real-life scenarios, thedeployment of sensors could be limited due to budget limitations andinstallation availability, which makes most current models not applicable.Though few pieces of literature tried to impute traffic states at the missinglocations, these methods need the data simultaneously observed at the locationswith sensors, making them not applicable to prediction tasks. Another drawbackis the lack of measurement of uncertainty in prediction, making prior worksunsuitable for risk-sensitive tasks or involving decision-making. To fill thegap, inspired by the previous inductive graph neural network, this workproposed an uncertainty-aware framework with the ability to 1) extendprediction to missing locations with no historical records and significantlyextend spatial coverage of prediction locations while reducing deployment ofsensors and 2) generate probabilistic prediction with uncertaintyquantification to help the management of risk and decision making in thedown-stream tasks. Through extensive experiments on real-life datasets, theresult shows our method achieved promising results on prediction tasks, and theuncertainty quantification gives consistent results which highly correlatedwith the locations with and without historical data. We also show that ourmodel could help support sensor deployment tasks in the transportation field toachieve higher accuracy with a limited sensor deployment budget.</description><author>Hao Mei, Junxian Li, Zhiming Liang, Guanjie Zheng, Bin Shi, Hua Wei</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 18:38:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06800v5</guid></item><item><title>Are ensembles getting better all the time?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17885v1</link><description>Ensemble methods combine the predictions of several base models. We studywhether or not including more models in an ensemble always improve its averageperformance. Such a question depends on the kind of ensemble considered, aswell as the predictive metric chosen. We focus on situations where all membersof the ensemble are a priori expected to perform as well, which is the case ofseveral popular methods like random forests or deep ensembles. In this setting,we essentially show that ensembles are getting better all the time if, and onlyif, the considered loss function is convex. More precisely, in that case, theaverage loss of the ensemble is a decreasing function of the number of models.When the loss function is nonconvex, we show a series of results that can besummarised by the insight that ensembles of good models keep getting better,and ensembles of bad models keep getting worse. To this end, we prove a newresult on the monotonicity of tail probabilities that may be of independentinterest.

Current approaches make strong assumptionsabout the form of the equation and thus fail to discover many well-knownsystems. Moreover, many of them resolve the equation-data mismatch byestimating the derivatives, which makes them inadequate for noisy andinfrequently sampled systems. To this end, we propose D-CIPHER, which is robustto measurement artifacts and can uncover a new and very general class ofdifferential equations. We further design a novel optimization procedure,CoLLie, to help D-CIPHER search through this class efficiently. Finally, wedemonstrate empirically that it can discover many well-known equations that arebeyond the capabilities of current methods.</description><author>Krzysztof Kacprzyk, Zhaozhi Qian, Mihaela van der Schaar</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 18:23:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10586v3</guid></item><item><title>TSDF-Sampling: Efficient Sampling for Neural Surface Field using Truncated Signed Distance Field</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17878v1</link><description>Multi-view neural surface reconstruction has exhibited impressive results.However, a notable limitation is the prohibitively slow inference time whencompared to traditional techniques, primarily attributed to the dense sampling,required to maintain the rendering quality.

In contrast, our method leverages the TSDFvolume generated only by the trained views, and it proves to provide areasonable bound on the sampling from upcoming novel views. As a result, weachieve high rendering quality by fully exploiting the continuous neural SDFestimation within the bounds given by the TSDF volume. Notably, our method isthe first approach that can be robustly plug-and-play into a diverse array ofneural surface field models, as long as they use the volume renderingtechnique. Our empirical results show an 11-fold increase in inference speedwithout compromising performance.

Various explanation methods, particularly those generating saliencymaps, aim to address this challenge. However, the inconsistency issues offaithfulness metrics hinder reliable benchmarking of explanation methods. Thispaper employs an approach inspired by psychometrics, utilizing Krippendorf'salpha to quantify the benchmark reliability of post-hoc methods in imageclassification. The study proposes model training modifications, includingfeeding perturbed samples and employing focal loss, to enhance robustness andcalibration.

NeuralRadiance Fields (NeRF) have greatly advanced image rendering andreconstruction, but the limited availability of 2D images poses uncertaintiesstemming from occlusions, depth ambiguities, and imaging errors. Efficientlyselecting informative views becomes crucial, and quantifying NeRF modeluncertainty presents intricate challenges. Existing approaches either depend onmodel architecture or are based on assumptions regarding density distributionsthat are not generally applicable. By leveraging Fisher Information, weefficiently quantify observed information within Radiance Fields without groundtruth data. This can be used for the next best view selection and pixel-wiseuncertainty quantification. Our method overcomes existing limitations on modelarchitecture and effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art results in both viewselection and uncertainty quantification, demonstrating its potential toadvance the field of Radiance Fields.

To mitigate these, morecomprehensive benchmarking procedures are needed to better understand AI4Smodels. This paper introduces a novel benchmarking approach, known asstructural interpretation, which addresses two key requirements: identifyingthe trusted operating range in the problem space and tracing errors back totheir computational components. This method partitions both the problem andmetric spaces, facilitating a structural exploration of these spaces. Thepractical utility and effectiveness of structural interpretation areillustrated through its application to three distinct AI4S workloads:machine-learning force fields (MLFF), jet tagging, and precipitationnowcasting. The benchmarks effectively model the trusted operating range, traceerrors, and reveal novel perspectives for refining the model, training process,and data sampling strategy.

However, the synthesistechnique is specific to a particular kind of label, such as binary labels orsequences, and each new label type requires manually designing a new synthesisalgorithm. Instead, we propose a universal technique that enables weaksupervision over any label type while still offering desirable properties,including practical flexibility, computational efficiency, and theoreticalguarantees. We apply this technique to important problems previously nottackled by WS frameworks including learning to rank, regression, and learningin hyperbolic space. Theoretically, our synthesis approach produces aconsistent estimators for learning some challenging but importantgeneralizations of the exponential family model.

However, the techniques that make weaksupervision attractive -- such as integrating any source of signal to estimateunknown labels -- also entail the danger that the produced pseudolabels arehighly biased. Surprisingly, given everyday use and the potential for increasedbias, weak supervision has not been studied from the point of view of fairness.We begin such a study, starting with the observation that even when a fairmodel can be built from a dataset with access to ground-truth labels, thecorresponding dataset labeled via weak supervision can be arbitrarily unfair.To address this, we propose and empirically validate a model for sourceunfairness in weak supervision, then introduce a simple counterfactualfairness-based technique that can mitigate these biases. Theoretically, we showthat it is possible for our approach to simultaneously improve both accuracyand fairness -- in contrast to standard fairness approaches that suffer fromtradeoffs. Empirically, we show that our technique improves accuracy on weaksupervision baselines by as much as 32\% while reducing demographic parity gapby 82.5\%.

Current 3D GANarchitectures, however, typically rely on volume representations, which areslow to render, thereby hampering the GAN training and requiringmulti-view-inconsistent 2D upsamplers. Here, we introduce Gaussian Shell Maps(GSMs) as a framework that connects SOTA generator network architectures withemerging 3D Gaussian rendering primitives using an articulable multishell--based scaffold. In this setting, a CNN generates a 3D texture stack withfeatures that are mapped to the shells. The latter represent inflated anddeflated versions of a template surface of a digital human in a canonical bodypose. Instead of rasterizing the shells directly, we sample 3D Gaussians on theshells whose attributes are encoded in the texture features. These Gaussiansare efficiently and differentiably rendered. The ability to articulate theshells is important during GAN training and, at inference time, to deform abody into arbitrary user-defined poses. Our efficient rendering scheme bypassesthe need for view-inconsistent upsamplers and achieves high-quality multi-viewconsistent renderings at a native resolution of $512 \times 512$ pixels. Wedemonstrate that GSMs successfully generate 3D humans when trained onsingle-view datasets, including SHHQ and DeepFashion.</description><author>Rameen Abdal, Wang Yifan, Zifan Shi, Yinghao Xu, Ryan Po, Zhengfei Kuang, Qifeng Chen, Dit-Yan Yeung, Gordon Wetzstein</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 18:04:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17857v1</guid></item><item><title>Leveraging Graph Diffusion Models for Network Refinement Tasks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17856v1</link><description>Most real-world networks are noisy and incomplete samples from an unknowntarget distribution. Refining them by correcting corruptions or inferringunobserved regions typically improves downstream performance. Inspired by theimpressive generative capabilities that have been used to correct corruptionsin images, and the similarities between "in-painting" and filling in missingnodes and edges conditioned on the observed graph, we propose a novel graphgenerative framework, SGDM, which is based on subgraph diffusion. Our frameworknot only improves the scalability and fidelity of graph diffusion models, butalso leverages the reverse process to perform novel, conditional generationtasks. In particular, through extensive empirical analysis and a set of novelmetrics, we demonstrate that our proposed model effectively supports thefollowing refinement tasks for partially observable networks: T1: denoisingextraneous subgraphs, T2: expanding existing subgraphs and T3: performing"style" transfer by regenerating a particular subgraph to match thecharacteristics of a different node or subgraph.</description><author>Puja Trivedi, Ryan Rossi, David Arbour, Tong Yu, Franck Dernoncourt, Sungchul Kim, Nedim Lipka, Namyong Park, Nesreen K.

An accurate response must take into accountthe full appearance of the object in 3D, various ways of phrasing thequestion/prompt, and changes in other factors that affect the response. Wepresent a method to marginalize over any factors varied across VLM queries,utilizing the VLM's scores for sampled responses. We first show that thisprobabilistic aggregation can outperform a language model (e.g., GPT4) forsummarization, for instance avoiding hallucinations when there are contrastingdetails between responses. Secondly, we show that aggregated annotations areuseful for prompt-chaining; they help improve downstream VLM predictions (e.g.,of object material when the object's type is specified as an auxiliary input inthe prompt). Such auxiliary inputs allow ablating and measuring thecontribution of visual reasoning over language-only reasoning.

Gaussian Splatting has recently become very popular asit yields realistic rendering while being significantly faster to train thanNeRFs. It is however challenging to extract a mesh from the millions of tiny 3Dgaussians as these gaussians tend to be unorganized after optimization and nomethod has been proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a regularizationterm that encourages the gaussians to align well with the surface of the scene.We then introduce a method that exploits this alignment to extract a mesh fromthe Gaussians using Poisson reconstruction, which is fast, scalable, andpreserves details, in contrast to the Marching Cubes algorithm usually appliedto extract meshes from Neural SDFs. Finally, we introduce an optionalrefinement strategy that binds gaussians to the surface of the mesh, andjointly optimizes these Gaussians and the mesh through Gaussian splattingrendering. This enables easy editing, sculpting, rigging, animating,compositing and relighting of the Gaussians using traditional softwares bymanipulating the mesh instead of the gaussians themselves. Retrieving such aneditable mesh for realistic rendering is done within minutes with our method,compared to hours with the state-of-the-art methods on neural SDFs, whileproviding a better rendering quality.

MDSis widely used as a data visualization tool in the social and biologicalsciences, statistics, and machine learning. We study the Kamada-Kawaiformulation of MDS: given a set of non-negative dissimilarities $\{d_{i,j}\}_{i, j \in [n]}$ over $n$ points, the goal is to find an embedding$\{x_1,\dots,x_n\} \subset \mathbb{R}^k$ that minimizes \[ \text{OPT} =\min_{x} \mathbb{E}_{i,j \in [n]} \left[ \left(1-\frac{\|x_i -x_j\|}{d_{i,j}}\right)^2 \right] \] Despite its popularity, our theoretical understanding of MDS is extremelylimited. Recently, Demaine, Hesterberg, Koehler, Lynch, and Urschel(arXiv:2109.11505) gave the first approximation algorithm with provableguarantees for Kamada-Kawai, which achieves an embedding with cost $\text{OPT}+\epsilon$ in $n^2 \cdot 2^{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(k \Delta^4 / \epsilon^2)}$time, where $\Delta$ is the aspect ratio of the input dissimilarities. In thiswork, we give the first approximation algorithm for MDS with quasi-polynomialdependency on $\Delta$: for target dimension $k$, we achieve a solution withcost $\mathcal{O}(\text{OPT}^{ \hspace{0.04in}1/k } \cdot \log(\Delta/\epsilon))+ \epsilon$ in time $n^{ \mathcal{O}(1)} \cdot 2^{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}( k^2(\log(\Delta)/\epsilon)^{k/2 + 1} ) }$. Our approach is based on a novel analysis of a conditioning-based roundingscheme for the Sherali-Adams LP Hierarchy. Crucially, our analysis exploits thegeometry of low-dimensional Euclidean space, allowing us to avoid anexponential dependence on the aspect ratio $\Delta$. We believe ourgeometry-aware treatment of the Sherali-Adams Hierarchy is an important steptowards developing general-purpose techniques for efficient metric optimizationalgorithms.</description><author>Ainesh Bakshi, Vincent Cohen-Addad, Samuel B.

Self-play isuseful for generating large quantities of data for learning, but has thedrawback that the agents the learner will face post-training may havedramatically different behavior than the learner came to expect by interactingwith itself. For the special case of two-player constant-sum games, self-playthat reaches Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to produce strategies that performwell against any post-training opponent; however, no such guarantee exists formultiplayer games.

With strong representationcapabilities, pretrained vision-and-language models are widely used in VLN.However, most of them are trained on web-crawled general-purpose datasets,which incurs a considerable domain gap when used for VLN tasks. To address theproblem, we propose a novel and model-agnostic domain-aware prompt learning(DAP) framework. For equipping the pretrained models with specific object-leveland scene-level cross-modal alignment in VLN tasks, DAP applies a low-costprompt tuning paradigm to learn soft visual prompts for extracting in-domainimage semantics. Specifically, we first generate a set of in-domain image-textpairs with the help of the CLIP model. Then we introduce soft visual prompts inthe input space of the visual encoder in a pretrained model. DAP injectsin-domain visual knowledge into the visual encoder of the pretrained model inan efficient way. Experimental results on both R2R and REVERIE show thesuperiority of DAP compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>Ting Liu, Yue Hu, Wansen Wu, Youkai Wang, Kai Xu, Quanjun Yin</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 17:03:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17812v1</guid></item><item><title>Cross-Axis Transformer with 2D Rotary Embeddings</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07184v2</link><description>Despite lagging behind their modal cousins in many respects, VisionTransformers have provided an interesting opportunity to bridge the gap betweensequence modeling and image modeling.

In this process, WSIs are first divided into patches, for which afeature extractor model is applied to obtain feature vectors, which aresubsequently processed by an aggregation model to predict the respective WSIlabel. With the rapid evolution of representation learning, numerous newfeature extractor models, often termed foundational models, have emerged.Traditional evaluation methods, however, rely on fixed aggregation modelhyperparameters, a framework we identify as potentially biasing the results.Our study uncovers a co-dependence between feature extractor models andaggregation model hyperparameters, indicating that performance comparabilitycan be skewed based on the chosen hyperparameters. By accounting for thisco-dependency, we find that the performance of many current feature extractormodels is notably similar. We support this insight by evaluating seven featureextractor models across three different datasets with 162 different aggregationmodel configurations. This comprehensive approach provides a more nuancedunderstanding of the relationship between feature extractors and aggregationmodels, leading to a fairer and more accurate assessment of feature extractormodels in digital pathology.</description><author>Gustav Bredell, Marcel Fischer, Przemyslaw Szostak, Samaneh Abbasi-Sureshjani, Alvaro Gomariz</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 16:54:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17804v1</guid></item><item><title>The Rise of the AI Co-Pilot: Lessons for Design from Aviation and Beyond</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14713v2</link><description>The fast pace of advances in AI promises to revolutionize various aspects ofknowledge work, extending its influence to daily life and professional fieldsalike.

Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is anemerging, brain-inspired machine learning technique that enjoys severaladvantages over existing DNNs, including being lightweight, requiringlow-precision operands, and being robust to noise introduced by thenonidealities in the hardware. For HDC, computing in-memory (CiM) approacheshave been widely used, as CiM reduces the data transfer cost if the operandscan fit into the memory. However, inefficient multi-bit operations, high writelatency, and low endurance make CiM ill-suited for HDC. On the other hand, theexisting electro-photonic DNN accelerators are inefficient for HDC because theyare specifically optimized for matrix multiplication in DNNs and consume a lotof power with high-precision data converters. In this paper, we argue that photonic computing and HDC complement each otherbetter than photonic computing and DNNs, or CiM and HDC. We propose PhotoHDC,the first-ever electro-photonic accelerator for HDC training and inference,supporting the basic, record-based, and graph encoding schemes. Evaluating withpopular datasets, we show that our accelerator can achieve two to five ordersof magnitude lower EDP than the state-of-the-art electro-photonic DNNaccelerators for implementing HDC training and inference. PhotoHDC alsoachieves four orders of magnitude lower energy-delay product than CiM-basedaccelerators for both HDC training and inference.</description><author>Farbin Fayza, Cansu Demirkiran, Hanning Chen, Che-Kai Liu, Avi Mohan, Hamza Errahmouni, Sanggeon Yun, Mohsen Imani, David Zhang, Darius Bunandar, Ajay Joshi</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 16:51:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17801v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning to Simulate: Generative Metamodeling via Quantile Regression</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17797v1</link><description>Stochastic simulation models, while effective in capturing the dynamics ofcomplex systems, are often too slow to run for real-time decision-making.Metamodeling techniques are widely used to learn the relationship between asummary statistic of the outputs (e.g., the mean or quantile) and the inputs ofthe simulator, so that it can be used in real time. However, this methodologyrequires the knowledge of an appropriate summary statistic in advance, makingit inflexible for many practical situations. In this paper, we propose a newmetamodeling concept, called generative metamodeling, which aims to construct a"fast simulator of the simulator". This technique can generate random outputssubstantially faster than the original simulation model, while retaining anapproximately equal conditional distribution given the same inputs. Onceconstructed, a generative metamodel can instantaneously generate a large amountof random outputs as soon as the inputs are specified, thereby facilitating theimmediate computation of any summary statistic for real-time decision-making.Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm -- quantile-regression-based generativemetamodeling (QRGMM) -- and study its convergence and rate of convergence.Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the empiricalperformance of QRGMM, compare it with other state-of-the-art generativealgorithms, and demonstrate its usefulness in practical real-timedecision-making.</description><author>L.

In theabsence of sufficient or high-quality labels, unsupervised feature selectionmethods are crucial for the success of subsequent algorithms. Therefore, thereis a growing need for unsupervised feature selection algorithms focused onimbalanced data. Thus, we propose a Marginal Laplacian Score (MLS) amodification of the well-known Laplacian Score (LS) to be better suited forimbalance data. We introduce an assumption that the minority class or anomalousappear more frequently in the margin of the features. Consequently, MLS aims topreserve the local structure of the data set's margin. As MLS is better suitedfor handling imbalanced data, we propose its integration into modern featureselection methods that utilize the Laplacian score. We integrate the MLSalgorithm into the Differentiable Unsupervised Feature Selection (DUFS),resulting in DUFS-MLS.

However,RALMs introduce unique system design challenges due to (a) the diverse workloadcharacteristics between LM inference and retrieval and (b) the various systemrequirements and bottlenecks for different RALM configurations such as modelsizes, database sizes, and retrieval frequencies. We propose Chameleon, aheterogeneous accelerator system that integrates both LM and retrievalaccelerators in a disaggregated architecture. The heterogeneity ensuresefficient acceleration of both LM inference and retrieval, while theaccelerator disaggregation enables the system to independently scale both typesof accelerators to fulfill diverse RALM requirements. Our Chameleon prototypeimplements retrieval accelerators on FPGAs and assigns LM inference to GPUs,with a CPU server orchestrating these accelerators over the network. Comparedto CPU-based and CPU-GPU vector search systems, Chameleon achieves up to 23.72xspeedup and 26.2x energy efficiency. Evaluated on various RALMs, Chameleonexhibits up to 2.16x reduction in latency and 3.18x speedup in throughputcompared to the hybrid CPU-GPU architecture.

Whileprevious studies have focused mostly on training the student MLP by matchingthe output probability distributions between the teacher and student modelsduring distillation, it has not been systematically studied how to inject thestructural information in an explicit and interpretable manner. Inspired byGNNs that separate feature transformation $T$ and propagation $\Pi$, were-frame the distillation process as making the student MLP learn both $T$ and$\Pi$. Although this can be achieved by applying the inverse propagation$\Pi^{-1}$ before distillation from the teacher, it still comes with a highcomputational cost from large matrix multiplications during training.

However, these approaches face challengesdue to the limitations of text-to-image diffusion models, which lack anunderstanding of 3D structures. Consequently, these methods struggle to achievehigh-quality human generation, resulting in smooth geometry and cartoon-likeappearances. In this paper, we propose HumanNorm, a novel approach forhigh-quality and realistic 3D human generation. The main idea is to enhance themodel's 2D perception of 3D geometry by learning a normal-adapted diffusionmodel and a normal-aligned diffusion model. The normal-adapted diffusion modelcan generate high-fidelity normal maps corresponding to user prompts withview-dependent and body-aware text. The normal-aligned diffusion model learnsto generate color images aligned with the normal maps, thereby transformingphysical geometry details into realistic appearance. Leveraging the proposednormal diffusion model, we devise a progressive geometry generation strategyand a multi-step Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss to enhance theperformance of 3D human generation. Comprehensive experiments substantiateHumanNorm's ability to generate 3D humans with intricate geometry and realisticappearances.

Pillar-based methods mainly employ randomlyinitialized 2D convolution neural network (ConvNet) for feature extraction andfail to enjoy the benefits from the backbone scaling and pretraining in theimage domain. To show the scaling-up capacity in point clouds, we introduce thedense ConvNet pretrained on large-scale image datasets (e.g., ImageNet) as the2D backbone of pillar-based detectors. The ConvNets are adaptively designedbased on the model size according to the specific features of point clouds,such as sparsity and irregularity.

However, thechallenging problem of text-to-4D dynamic 3D scene generation with diffusionguidance remains largely unexplored. We propose Dream-in-4D, which features anovel two-stage approach for text-to-4D synthesis, leveraging (1) 3D and 2Ddiffusion guidance to effectively learn a high-quality static 3D asset in thefirst stage; (2) a deformable neural radiance field that explicitlydisentangles the learned static asset from its deformation, preserving qualityduring motion learning; and (3) a multi-resolution feature grid for thedeformation field with a displacement total variation loss to effectively learnmotion with video diffusion guidance in the second stage. Through a userpreference study, we demonstrate that our approach significantly advances imageand motion quality, 3D consistency and text fidelity for text-to-4D generationcompared to baseline approaches. Thanks to its motion-disentangledrepresentation, Dream-in-4D can also be easily adapted for controllablegeneration where appearance is defined by one or multiple images, without theneed to modify the motion learning stage.

In this paper, we systematicallyinvestigate the banding image quality assessment (IQA) problem, aiming todetect the image banding artifacts and evaluate their perceptual visualquality. Considering that the existing image banding databases only containlimited content sources and banding generation methods, and lack perceptualquality labels (i.e. mean opinion scores), we first build the largest bandingIQA database so far, named Banding Artifact Noticeable Database (BAND-2k),which consists of 2,000 banding images generated by 15 compression andquantization schemes. A total of 23 workers participated in the subjective IQAexperiment, yielding over 214,000 patch-level banding class labels and 44,371reliable image-level quality ratings. Subsequently, we develop an effectiveno-reference (NR) banding evaluator for banding detection and qualityassessment by leveraging frequency characteristics of banding artifacts. A dualconvolutional neural network is employed to concurrently learn the featurerepresentation from the high-frequency and low-frequency maps, therebyenhancing the ability to discern banding artifacts. The quality score of abanding image is generated by pooling the banding detection maps masked by thespatial frequency filters. Experiments demonstrate that our banding evaluatorachieves a remarkably high accuracy in banding detection and also exhibits highSRCC and PLCC results with the perceptual quality labels. These findings unveilthe strong correlations between the intensity of banding artifacts and theperceptual visual quality, thus validating the necessity of banding qualityassessment.</description><author>Zijian Chen, Wei Sun, Jun Jia, Fangfang Lu, Zicheng Zhang, Jing Liu, Ru Huang, Xiongkuo Min, Guangtao Zhai</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 15:56:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17752v1</guid></item><item><title>Addressing Membership Inference Attack in Federated Learning with Model Compression</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17750v1</link><description>Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed as a privacy-preserving solutionfor machine learning.

The ability of neural networks to learn efficient imagerepresentations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-drivenregularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods rely on an implicitregularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approachesconsider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of agenerative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However,state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training datacompared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization ofthe latent MAP. In this work, we propose to use compressive autoencoders forlatent estimation. These networks, which can be seen as variationalautoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train thanstate-of-the-art generative models. We then introduce the Variational BayesLatent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs this estimation within theframework of variational inference. This allows for fast and easy (approximate)posterior sampling. Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQdemonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance than state-of-the-artplug-and-play methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties faster thanother existing posterior sampling techniques.</description><author>Maud Biquard, Marie Chabert, Thomas Oberlin</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 15:49:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17744v1</guid></item><item><title>Mukhyansh: A Headline Generation Dataset for Indic Languages</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17743v1</link><description>The task of headline generation within the realm of Natural LanguageProcessing (NLP) holds immense significance, as it strives to distill the trueessence of textual content into concise and attention-grabbing summaries.

Abarrier is that their predictions cannot be attributed to individual features,as they compare two inputs rather than processing a single one. This paperderives a local attribution method for Siamese encoders by generalizing theprinciple of integrated gradients to models with multiple inputs. The solutiontakes the form of feature-pair attributions, and can be reduced to atoken-token matrix for STs. Our method involves the introduction of integratedJacobians and inherits the advantageous formal properties of integratedgradients: it accounts for the model's full computation graph and is guaranteedto converge to the actual prediction. A pilot study shows that in an ST fewtoken-pairs can often explain large fractions of predictions, and it focuses onnouns and verbs. For accurate predictions, it however needs to attend to themajority of tokens and parts of speech.</description><author>Lucas Möller, Dmitry Nikolaev, Sebastian Padó</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 15:12:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05703v3</guid></item><item><title>SAMPro3D: Locating SAM Prompts in 3D for Zero-Shot Scene Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17707v1</link><description>We introduce SAMPro3D for zero-shot 3D indoor scene segmentation. Given the3D point cloud and multiple posed 2D frames of 3D scenes, our approach segments3D scenes by applying the pretrained Segment Anything Model (SAM) to 2D frames.Our key idea involves locating 3D points in scenes as natural 3D prompts toalign their projected pixel prompts across frames, ensuring frame-consistencyin both pixel prompts and their SAM-predicted masks. Moreover, we suggestfiltering out low-quality 3D prompts based on feedback from all 2D frames, forenhancing segmentation quality. We also propose to consolidate different 3Dprompts if they are segmenting the same object, bringing a more comprehensivesegmentation. Notably, our method does not require any additional training ondomain-specific data, enabling us to preserve the zero-shot power of SAM.Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show that our methodconsistently achieves higher quality and more diverse segmentation thanprevious zero-shot or fully supervised approaches, and in many cases evensurpasses human-level annotations.

These models often struggle to disentangle the target languagecontext from sociocultural biases, resulting in biased image generation. Toovercome this challenge, we propose Fair Mapping, a general, model-agnostic,and lightweight approach that modifies a pre-trained text-to-image model bycontrolling the prompt to achieve fair image generation. One key advantage ofour approach is its high efficiency. The training process only requiresupdating a small number of parameters in an additional linear mapping network.This not only reduces the computational cost but also accelerates theoptimization process. We first demonstrate the issue of bias in generatedresults caused by language biases in text-guided diffusion models. Bydeveloping a mapping network that projects language embeddings into an unbiasedspace, we enable the generation of relatively balanced demographic resultsbased on a keyword specified in the prompt. With comprehensive experiments onface image generation, we show that our method significantly improves imagegeneration performance when prompted with descriptions related to human faces.By effectively addressing the issue of bias, we produce more fair and diverseimage outputs. This work contributes to the field of text-to-image generationby enhancing the ability to generate images that accurately reflect theintended demographic characteristics specified in the text.</description><author>Jia Li, Lijie Hu, Jingfeng Zhang, Tianhang Zheng, Hua Zhang, Di Wang</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 15:02:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17695v1</guid></item><item><title>Rigorous dynamical mean field theory for stochastic gradient descent methods</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06591v3</link><description>We prove closed-form equations for the exact high-dimensional asymptotics ofa family of first order gradient-based methods, learning an estimator (e.g.M-estimator, shallow neural network, ...) from observations on Gaussian datawith empirical risk minimization.

However, existingsystems lack the ability to accommodate the unique preferences and requirementsof individual surgeons. Additionally, they primarily focus on general surgeries(e.g., laparoscopy) and are not suitable for highly precise microsurgeries,such as ophthalmic procedures. Thus, we propose a simulation-based image-guidedapproach for surgeon-centered autonomous agents that can adapt to theindividual surgeon's skill level and preferred surgical techniques duringophthalmic cataract surgery. Our approach utilizes a simulated environment totrain reinforcement and imitation learning agents guided by image data toperform all tasks of the incision phase of cataract surgery. By integrating thesurgeon's actions and preferences into the training process with thesurgeon-in-the-loop, our approach enables the robot to implicitly learn andadapt to the individual surgeon's unique approach through demonstrations. Thisresults in a more intuitive and personalized surgical experience for thesurgeon. Simultaneously, it ensures consistent performance for the autonomousrobotic apprentice. We define and evaluate the effectiveness of our approachusing our proposed metrics; and highlight the trade-off between a generic agentand a surgeon-centered adapted agent. Moreover, our approach has the potentialto extend to other ophthalmic surgical procedures, opening the door to a newgeneration of surgeon-in-the-loop autonomous surgical robots.

Thisplaces the challenge to approximate or generate the channel or its derivativefrom samples generated by pilot signaling in real-world scenarios. Currently,there are two prevalent methods to solve this problem. One is to generate thechannel via a generative adversarial network (GAN), and the other is to, inessence, approximate the gradient via reinforcement learning methods. Othermethods include using score-based methods, variational autoencoders, ormutual-information-based methods. In this paper, we focus on generative modelsand, in particular, on a new promising method called diffusion models, whichhave shown a higher quality of generation in image-based tasks. We will showthat diffusion models can be used in wireless E2E scenarios and that they workas good as Wasserstein GANs while having a more stable training procedure and abetter generalization ability in testing.</description><author>Muah Kim, Rick Fritschek, Rafael F.

The aviation industry is characterizedby an abundance of complex, unstructured text data, replete with technicaljargon and specialized terminology. Moreover, labeled data for model buildingare scarce in this domain, resulting in low usage of aviation text data. Theemergence of LLMs presents an opportunity to transform this situation, butthere is a lack of LLMs specifically designed for the aviation domain. Toaddress this gap, we propose AviationGPT, which is built on open-source LLaMA-2and Mistral architectures and continuously trained on a wealth of carefullycurated aviation datasets. Experimental results reveal that AviationGPT offersusers multiple advantages, including the versatility to tackle diverse naturallanguage processing (NLP) problems (e.g., question-answering, summarization,document writing, information extraction, report querying, data cleaning, andinteractive data exploration). It also provides accurate and contextuallyrelevant responses within the aviation domain and significantly improvesperformance (e.g., over a 40% performance gain in tested cases).

This alignmentrequires a vast corpus of human feedback to learn a reward model, which issubsequently used to finetune language models. However, we have identified thatthe reward model often finds shortcuts to bypass its intended objectives,misleadingly assuming that humans prefer longer responses. The emergence oflength bias often induces the model to favor longer outputs, yet it doesn'tequate to an increase in helpful information within these outputs. In thispaper, we propose an innovative solution, applying the Product-of-Experts (PoE)technique to separate reward modeling from the influence of sequence length. Inour framework, the main expert concentrates on understanding human intents,while the biased expert targets the identification and capture of length bias.To further enhance the learning of bias, we introduce perturbations into thebias-focused expert, disrupting the flow of semantic information. Experimentalresults validate the effectiveness of our approach, indicating that languagemodel performance is improved, irrespective of sequence length.</description><author>Wei Shen, Rui Zheng, Wenyu Zhan, Jun Zhao, Shihan Dou, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 14:45:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05199v5</guid></item><item><title>Adapting Sentence Transformers for the Aviation Domain</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09556v2</link><description>Learning effective sentence representations is crucial for many NaturalLanguage Processing (NLP) tasks, including semantic search, semantic textualsimilarity (STS), and clustering. While multiple transformer models have beendeveloped for sentence embedding learning, these models may not performoptimally when dealing with specialized domains like aviation, which has uniquecharacteristics such as technical jargon, abbreviations, and unconventionalgrammar. Furthermore, the absence of labeled datasets makes it difficult totrain models specifically for the aviation domain. To address these challenges,we propose a novel approach for adapting sentence transformers for the aviationdomain. Our method is a two-stage process consisting of pre-training followedby fine-tuning. During pre-training, we use Transformers and SequentialDenoising AutoEncoder (TSDAE) with aviation text data as input to improve theinitial model performance. Subsequently, we fine-tune our models using aNatural Language Inference (NLI) dataset in the Sentence Bidirectional EncoderRepresentations from Transformers (SBERT) architecture to mitigate overfittingissues. Experimental results on several downstream tasks show that our adaptedsentence transformers significantly outperform general-purpose transformers,demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in capturing the nuances of theaviation domain.

However, during the training process, thenon-independent-and-identically-distributed (Non-IID) data generated onheterogeneous clients and frequent communication across participants maysignificantly influence the training performance, slow down the convergentrate, and increase communication consumption. In this paper, we ameliorate thestandard stochastic gradient descent approach by introducing the aggregatedgradients at each local update epoch and propose an adaptive learning rateiterative algorithm that further takes the deviation between the localparameter and global parameter into account. The aforementioned adaptivelearning rate design mechanism requires local information of all clients, whichis challenging as there is no communication during the local update epochs. Toobtain a decentralized adaptive learning rate for each client, we introduce themean-field approach by utilizing two mean-field terms to estimate the averagelocal parameters and gradients respectively without exchanging clients' localinformation with each other over time. Through theoretical analysis, we provethat our method can provide the convergence guarantee for model training andderive a convergent upper bound for the client drifting term.
