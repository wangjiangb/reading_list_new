An Empirical Study with the MME-CoF Benchmark</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26802v1</link><description>Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherentvideos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyondrealistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visualperception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question stillremains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challengingvisual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study tocomprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popularVeo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, includingspatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematicallycharacterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enablesin-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Ourfindings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoningpatterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, andlocally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causalreasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they arenot yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouragingsigns as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.Project page: https://video-cof.github.io</description><author>Ziyu Guo, Xinyan Chen, Renrui Zhang, Ruichuan An, Yu Qi, Dongzhi Jiang, Xiangtai Li, Manyuan Zhang, Hongsheng Li, Pheng-Ann Heng</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:59:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26802v1</guid></item><item><title>OmniX: From Unified Panoramic Generation and Perception to Graphics-Ready 3D Scenes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26800v1</link><description>There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generationand 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as apromising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produceimmersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advancethis technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physicallybased rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is torepurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasizeappearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, wepresent OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight andefficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors fora broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale syntheticpanorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverseindoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectivenessof our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scenegeneration, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realisticvirtual world generation.</description><author>Yukun Huang, Jiwen Yu, Yanning Zhou, Jianan Wang, Xintao Wang, Pengfei Wan, Xihui Liu</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:59:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26800v1</guid></item><item><title>UniSite: The First Cross-Structure Dataset and Learning Framework for End-to-End Ligand Binding Site Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03237v2</link><description>The detection of ligand binding sites for proteins is a fundamental step inStructure-Based Drug Design. Despite notable advances in recent years, existingmethods, datasets, and evaluation metrics are confronted with several keychallenges: (1) current datasets and methods are centered on individualprotein-ligand complexes and neglect that diverse binding sites may existacross multiple complexes of the same protein, introducing significantstatistical bias; (2) ligand binding site detection is typically modeled as adiscontinuous workflow, employing binary segmentation and subsequent clusteringalgorithms; (3) traditional evaluation metrics do not adequately reflect theactual performance of different binding site prediction methods. To addressthese issues, we first introduce UniSite-DS, the first UniProt (UniqueProtein)-centric ligand binding site dataset, which contains 4.81 times moremulti-site data and 2.08 times more overall data compared to the previouslymost widely used datasets. We then propose UniSite, the first end-to-end ligandbinding site detection framework supervised by set prediction loss withbijective matching. In addition, we introduce Average Precision based onIntersection over Union (IoU) as a more accurate evaluation metric for ligandbinding site prediction. Extensive experiments on UniSite-DS and severalrepresentative benchmark datasets demonstrate that IoU-based Average Precisionprovides a more accurate reflection of prediction quality, and that UniSiteoutperforms current state-of-the-art methods in ligand binding site detection.The dataset and codes will be made publicly available athttps://github.com/quanlin-wu/unisite.</description><author>Jigang Fan, Quanlin Wu, Shengjie Luo, Liwei Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:59:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03237v2</guid></item><item><title>Masked Diffusion Captioning for Visual Feature Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26799v1</link><description>We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditionedmasked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusioncaptioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair aremasked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual featuresis trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visualfeatures can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressivecaptioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not dependon each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliaryobjectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scalemodels and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive withthose produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.</description><author>Chao Feng, Zihao Wei, Andrew Owens</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:59:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26799v1</guid></item><item><title>SEE4D: Pose-Free 4D Generation via Auto-Regressive Video Inpainting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26796v1</link><description>Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content fromcasual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methodstypically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensiveand brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approachesmitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel cameratrajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, therebydepicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, thistrajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scenedynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, apose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectoryprediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, therebyseparating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional videoinpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoisingrealistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missingregions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3Dannotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporalautoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines andextends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation atbounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generationand sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics andqualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization andimproved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.</description><author>Dongyue Lu, Ao Liang, Tianxin Huang, Xiao Fu, Yuyang Zhao, Baorui Ma, Liang Pan, Wei Yin, Lingdong Kong, Wei Tsang Ooi, Ziwei Liu</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:59:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26796v1</guid></item><item><title>Scaling Image Geo-Localization to Continent Level</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26795v1</link><description>Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scaleremains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques areinefficient due to the sheer volume of images (&gt;100M) and fail when coverage isinsufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: globalclassification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), whilecross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domaingap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces ahybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a largegeographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classificationtask during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitlyencode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes withembeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity ofground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areasspanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that ourapproach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a datasetcovering a large part of Europe.

In contrast, adjacent generative fields, mostnotably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalizationin modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen canleverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive frameworkthat systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three keypillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, alarge-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples thatintegrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motionsfrom web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGenmodels. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motiontriplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we proposeViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors fromMoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhanceefficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant thateliminates video generation dependencies while preserving stronggeneralization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designedfor fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, andgeneralization ability. Extensive experiments show that our frameworksignificantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and humanevaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.</description><author>Jing Lin, Ruisi Wang, Junzhe Lu, Ziqi Huang, Guorui Song, Ailing Zeng, Xian Liu, Chen Wei, Wanqi Yin, Qingping Sun, Zhongang Cai, Lei Yang, Ziwei Liu</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:59:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26794v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning Pseudorandom Numbers with Transformers: Permuted Congruential Generators, Curricula, and Interpretability</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26792v1</link><description>We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated byPermuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-randomnumber generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficultyover linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wiseshifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show thatTransformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction onunseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond publishedclassical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using upto $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it canbe reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presentedtogether during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifyingstructures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law withmodulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required fornear-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimizationenters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstratinga critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embeddinglayers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneouslygroups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.</description><author>Tao Tao, Maissam Barkeshli</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:59:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26792v1</guid></item><item><title>Gistify!

Wepropose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specificentrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate theoutput of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing onlythe essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success onGistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accuratemodeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentiallylarge code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art modelsstruggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executionstraces.</description><author>Hyunji Lee, Minseon Kim, Chinmay Singh, Matheus Pereira, Atharv Sonwane, Isadora White, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal, Zhengyan Shi, Alessandro Sordoni, Marc-Alexandre Côté, Xingdi Yuan, Lucas Caccia</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:58:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26790v1</guid></item><item><title>Defeating the Training-Inference Mismatch via FP16</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26788v1</link><description>Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) oftensuffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training andinference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issuethrough algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that itsroot cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adoptedBF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors thatbreaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, wedemonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates thismismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with onlya few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the modelarchitecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and strongerperformance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope thesefindings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RLfine-tuning.</description><author>Penghui Qi, Zichen Liu, Xiangxin Zhou, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Wee Sun Lee, Min Lin</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:58:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26788v1</guid></item><item><title>Remote Labor Index: Measuring AI Automation of Remote Work</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26787v1</link><description>AIs have made rapid progress on research-oriented benchmarks of knowledge andreasoning, but it remains unclear how these gains translate into economic valueand automation.

Existing methodsto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristichierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizabilityacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motionmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationshipsdirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-basedhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions intoparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchyinference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices representelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependenciesthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstructionapproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, anddynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results showthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to thebaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulationapplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

Using causal mediation analysis ona diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number ofattention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation ofthe filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstratethat this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extractedand reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we alsoidentify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy forfiltering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storingthis intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Ourresults reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretableimplementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in waysthat are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functionalprogramming patterns.</description><author>Arnab Sen Sharma, Giordano Rogers, Natalie Shapira, David Bau</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:57:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26784v1</guid></item><item><title>TinyTim: A Family of Language Models for Divergent Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11607v2</link><description>In the search for artificial general intelligence, model development andtraining has focused primarily on vast datasets of known problems and theiraccepted solutions. This process necessarily produces convergent systems whichare fundamentally incapable of the conceptual reframing that is required forgenuine creative breakthroughs. Inspired by the divergent cognitive processesthat allow humans to make such creative leaps, our work introduces a family oflanguage models, TinyTim, to serve as sources of divergent generation withinbroader systems. These models have been created by fine-tuning on theanti-parsimonious text of James Joyce's `Finnegans Wake'. Quantitative analysisof both an unsupervised fine-tuned model (TinyTim-V1) and a newinstruction-tuned variant (TinyTim-V2) demonstrates a profound capacity forlexical invention; the foundational V1 model exhibits a Yule's K score forlexical richness over twenty times greater than that of convergent baselines.This trait is a stable property of the family, as the instruction-tuned V2maintains a statistically distinct profile and resists factual convergence,sacrificing benchmark performance to preserve its core generative style. Thiswork establishes a methodology for engineering specialized divergent modelsthat, when paired with convergent systems, can reframe problems and forcebreakthroughs beyond the reach of statistical optimization alone.</description><author>Christopher J.

In ATE estimation, the balancing weights andthe regression functions of the outcome play important roles, where thebalancing weights are referred to as the Riesz representer, bias-correctionterm, and clever covariates, depending on the context. Riesz regression,covariate balancing, DRE, and the matching estimator are methods for estimatingthe balancing weights, where Riesz regression is essentially equivalent to DREin the ATE context, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and DRE isin a dual relationship with covariate balancing.

Accurate world models are essential forenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamicsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle anddegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representationquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy orentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore askwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improveworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a trulyaccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructinga model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. Wepropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces thatconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latentrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latentrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scaleswith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generativebackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show thatits benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometricstructure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representationlearning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, deliveringreliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.</description><author>Zaishuo Xia, Yukuan Lu, Xinyi Li, Yifan Xu, Yubei Chen</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:56:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26782v1</guid></item><item><title>ChartAB: A Benchmark for Chart Grounding &amp; Dense Alignment</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26781v1</link><description>Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, andthe exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extractfine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding alsohinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In thispaper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide acomprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extractingtabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing variousattributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSONtemplate to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specificallytailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inferenceworkflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align andcompare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations onseveral recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. Thesefindings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chartunderstanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthenedin current models.</description><author>Aniruddh Bansal, Davit Soselia, Dang Nguyen, Tianyi Zhou</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:56:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26781v1</guid></item><item><title>S-CFE: Simple Counterfactual Explanations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15723v7</link><description>We study the problem of finding optimal sparse, manifold-alignedcounterfactual explanations for classifiers. Canonically, this can beformulated as an optimization problem with multiple non-convex components,including classifier loss functions and manifold alignment (or\emph{plausibility}) metrics. The added complexity of enforcing\emph{sparsity}, or shorter explanations, complicates the problem further.Existing methods often focus on specific models and plausibility measures,relying on convex $\ell_1$ regularizers to enforce sparsity. In this paper, wetackle the canonical formulation using the accelerated proximal gradient (APG)method, a simple yet efficient first-order procedure capable of handling smoothnon-convex objectives and non-smooth $\ell_p$ (where $0 \leq p &lt; 1$)regularizers. This enables our approach to seamlessly incorporate variousclassifiers and plausibility measures while producing sparser solutions.

Our framework unifiesRiesz regression for automatic debiased machine learning, covariate balancing,targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and density-ratio estimation. Inmany problems involving causal effects or structural models, the parameters ofinterest depend on regression functions. Plugging regression functionsestimated by machine learning methods into the identifying equations can yieldpoor performance because of first-stage bias. To reduce such bias, debiasedmachine learning employs Neyman orthogonal estimating equations. Debiasedmachine learning typically requires estimation of the Riesz representer and theregression function. For this problem, we develop a direct debiased machinelearning framework with an end-to-end algorithm. We formulate estimation of thenuisance parameters, the regression function and the Riesz representer, asminimizing the discrepancy between Neyman orthogonal scores computed with knownand unknown nuisance parameters, which we refer to as Neyman targetedestimation. Neyman targeted estimation includes Riesz representer estimation,and we measure discrepancies using the Bregman divergence.

However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset isresource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approachinvolves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this methodoften results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance insample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced samplingtechniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yetrepresentative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochasticdistribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IFestimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, atypical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively themodel forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on theremaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memoryusage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.</description><author>Jungyeon Koh, Hyeonsu Lyu, Jonggyu Jang, Hyun Jong Yang</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:55:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26776v1</guid></item><item><title>Completion $\neq$ Collaboration: Scaling Collaborative Effort with Agents</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25744v2</link><description>Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot taskcompletion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborativenature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecifiedand evolve.

To support this shift, we introducecollaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utilitygrows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulatedevaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform inmulti-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agentdesign: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior andguiding development toward more effective interactions.</description><author>Shannon Zejiang Shen, Valerie Chen, Ken Gu, Alexis Ross, Zixian Ma, Jillian Ross, Alex Gu, Chenglei Si, Wayne Chi, Andi Peng, Jocelyn J Shen, Ameet Talwalkar, Tongshuang Wu, David Sontag</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:54:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25744v2</guid></item><item><title>STaMP: Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision for Low-Precision Activation Quantization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26771v1</link><description>Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power andmemory footprint of generative AI models.

Westudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to actautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooseswhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If theagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading toa corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as atwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifiesas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide analignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's valuefunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefitsitself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPGframework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specificform of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent gamemeet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving itsown outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates atransparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns todefer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and theenvironment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation showsthat through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimaloversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learnswhen to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safetyviolations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method formaking misaligned models safer after deployment.</description><author>William Overman, Mohsen Bayati</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:46:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26752v1</guid></item><item><title>Smoothing Slot Attention Iterations and Recurrences</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05417v2</link><description>Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstreamObject-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated intorespective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start queryvectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, suchaggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queriescold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame'sslots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specificcues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transformsdifferent from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for thefirst time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the imageor video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with richinformation of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} thehomogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full andsingle iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterationsand recurrences.

To address theseissues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction(RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate bothslots and features, which provides more information for query prediction;(\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-featurepairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learntransition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that ourmethod surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 pointson object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art.

Humans deploy a rich repertoire of linguistic strategies tobalance informational and social goals -- from positive approaches that buildrapport (compliments, expressions of interest) to negative strategies thatminimize imposition (hedging, indirectness). We investigate whether LLMs employa similarly context-sensitive repertoire by comparing human and LLM responsesin both constrained and open-ended production tasks. We find that larger models($\ge$70B parameters) successfully replicate key preferences from thecomputational pragmatics literature, and human evaluators surprisingly preferLLM-generated responses in open-ended contexts. However, further linguisticanalyses reveal that models disproportionately rely on negative politenessstrategies even in positive contexts, potentially leading tomisinterpretations. While modern LLMs demonstrate an impressive handle onpoliteness strategies, these subtle differences raise important questions aboutpragmatic alignment in AI systems.</description><author>Haoran Zhao, Robert D.

Inparticular, when denoising a particular pixel, the model relies on a limitedneighborhood of the input image around that pixel, which, according to theprevious work, is tightly related to the ability of these models to producenovel images. Since locality is central to generalization, it is crucial tounderstand why diffusion models learn local behavior in the first place, aswell as the factors that govern the properties of locality patterns. In thiswork, we present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges asa statistical property of the image dataset and is not due to the inductivebias of convolutional neural networks, as suggested in previous work.Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal parametric linear denoiserexhibits similar locality properties to deep neural denoisers. We show, boththeoretically and experimentally, that this locality arises directly from pixelcorrelations present in the image datasets. Moreover, locality patterns aredrastically different on specialized datasets, approximating principalcomponents of the data's covariance. We use these insights to craft ananalytical denoiser that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusionmodel than prior expert-crafted alternatives. Our key takeaway is that whileneural network architectures influence generation quality, their primary roleis to capture locality patterns inherent in the data.</description><author>Artem Lukoianov, Chenyang Yuan, Justin Solomon, Vincent Sitzmann</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:40:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09672v2</guid></item><item><title>Deep sequence models tend to memorize geometrically; it is unclear why</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26745v1</link><description>In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has beenpredominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences betweenentities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of howmemory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance ofTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage ofthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model musthave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding globalrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This inturn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold compositioninto an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task. From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embeddinggeometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardlyattributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not moresuccinct than a brute-force lookup of associations. Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometrystems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeedarises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis alsopoints to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory morestrongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encouragesrevisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas likeknowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.</description><author>Shahriar Noroozizadeh, Vaishnavh Nagarajan, Elan Rosenfeld, Sanjiv Kumar</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:40:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26745v1</guid></item><item><title>Quality Over Quantity?

Although many existing adversarial attackmethods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-normperturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptualcapabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus towardgenerating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-basedapproaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due toinstability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employedfor UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbationinjection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. Inthis paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based ondiffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretableadversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distributiontowards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency mapto inject the visual information of a reference image into the generatedsamples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number ofnatural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models butalso retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebAdatasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models inboth black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdvachieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality, whilemaintaining inference efficiency. Furthermore, the dynamic balance betweendenoising and adversarial perturbation enables ScoreAdv to remain robust evenunder defensive measures.</description><author>Chihan Huang, Hao Tang</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:35:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06078v2</guid></item><item><title>Massive Supervised Fine-tuning Experiments Reveal How Data, Layer, and Training Factors Shape LLM Alignment Quality</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14681v2</link><description>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a critical step in aligning large languagemodels (LLMs) with human instructions and values, yet many aspects of SFTremain poorly understood.

Researchers have suggested leveraging the piecewise affineproperty of deep NN models to solve mp-QP with linear constraints, which alsoexhibit piecewise affine behaviour. However, traditional deep NN applicationsto mp-QP fall short of providing optimal and feasible predictions, even whentrained on large datasets. This study proposes a partially-supervised NN (PSNN)architecture that directly represents the mathematical structure of the globalsolution function. In contrast to generic NN training approaches, the proposedPSNN method derives a large proportion of model weights directly from themathematical properties of the optimization problem, producing more accuratesolutions despite significantly smaller training data sets. Many energymanagement problems are formulated as QP, so we apply the proposed approach toenergy systems (specifically DC optimal power flow) to demonstrate proof ofconcept.

Results show KKT sufficient conditions forPSNN consistently outperform generic NN architectures with classical trainingusing far less data, including when tested on extreme, out-of-trainingdistribution test data.

To mitigate this,Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures activate only a small portion ofparameters during inference, significantly lowering both memory demand andcomputational overhead. However, conventional MoE inference approaches, whichselect active experts independently at each layer, often introduce considerablelatency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and GPU memory. Inaddition, current cross-layer prediction strategies, which are typically basedon fixed steps, lack adaptability across different hardware platforms andworkloads, thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness. To address these challenges, we present ExpertFlow, a runtime system for MoEinference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing.ExpertFlow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation byleveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth, parameterdimensionality, and model feedback signals. Furthermore, it incorporates ahybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information withintermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. Byadaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usagebehavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latencycaused by expert swap-ins. Our evaluation demonstrates that ExpertFlow reducesmodel stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, highlighting its capabilityto optimize MoE inference under stringent memory constraints.</description><author>Zixu Shen, Kexin Chu, Yifan Zhang, Dawei Xiang, Runxin Wu, Wei Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:29:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26730v1</guid></item><item><title>Enhancing Reasoning Skills in Small Persian Medical Language Models Can Outperform Large-Scale Data Training</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20059v2</link><description>Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical forspecialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly inunderrepresented languages like Persian.

This study aimsto integrate protein sequence data with expression levels to improve themolecular characterization of breast cancer subtypes and predict clinicaloutcomes. Using ProtGPT2, a language model specifically designed for proteinsequences, we generated embeddings that capture the functional and structuralproperties of proteins. These embeddings were integrated with proteinexpression levels to form enriched biological representations, which wereanalyzed using machine learning methods, such as ensemble K-means forclustering and XGBoost for classification. Our approach enabled the successfulclustering of patients into biologically distinct groups and accuratelypredicted clinical outcomes such as survival and biomarker status, achievinghigh performance metrics, notably an F1 score of 0.88 for survival and 0.87 forbiomarker status prediction. Feature importance analysis identified KMT2C,CLASP2, and MYO1B as key proteins involved in hormone signaling, cytoskeletalremodeling, and therapy resistance in hormone receptor-positive andtriple-negative breast cancer, with potential influence on breast cancersubtype behavior and progression. Furthermore, protein-protein interactionnetworks and correlation analyses revealed functional interdependencies amongproteins that may influence the behavior and progression of breast cancersubtypes.

There are two majorapproaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)approach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to aclassification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the populationwelfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy bymaximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based onregression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.This study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both arebased on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove anexact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization ofthe policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable inseveral respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under commonconditions. Leveraging this equivalence, we propose a novel regularizationmethod for policy learning. Our findings yield a convex and computationallyefficient training procedure that avoids the NP-hard combinatorial steptypically required in EWM.</description><author>Masahiro Kato</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:23:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26723v1</guid></item><item><title>Non-Convex Over-the-Air Heterogeneous Federated Learning: A Bias-Variance Trade-off</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26722v1</link><description>Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as ascalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wirelessmultiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. ExistingOTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) orforcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest deviceand inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FLlargely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highlynon-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradientdescent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wirelessheterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. Wederive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradientnorm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize thistrade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop anefficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires onlystatistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex imageclassification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design acceleratesconvergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FLbaselines.</description><author>Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar, Nicolò Michelusi</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:22:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26722v1</guid></item><item><title>Unveiling Intrinsic Text Bias in Multimodal Large Language Models through Attention Key-Space Analysis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26721v1</link><description>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference fortextual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability toreason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attributethis text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instructiontuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internalarchitecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (VisualKeys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learnedduring language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receivesystematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading totheir under-utilization in the context representation. To validate thishypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze theirdistributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence thatvisual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attentionspace. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceedingintra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings revealthat text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention keyspace rather than solely from external data factors.</description><author>Xinhan Zheng, Huyu Wu, Xueting Wang, Haiyun Jiang</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:22:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26721v1</guid></item><item><title>Reducing base drag on road vehicles using pulsed jets optimized by hybrid genetic algorithms</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26718v1</link><description>Aerodynamic drag on flat-backed vehicles like vans and trucks is dominated bya low-pressure wake, whose control is critical for reducing fuel consumption.This paper presents an experimental study at $Re_W\approx 78,300$ on activeflow control using four pulsed jets at the rear edges of a bluff body model. Ahybrid genetic algorithm, combining a global search with a local gradient-basedoptimizer, was used to determine the optimal jet actuation parameters in anexperiment-in-the-loop setup. The cost function was designed to achieve a netenergy saving by simultaneously minimizing aerodynamic drag and penalizing theactuation's energy consumption. The optimization campaign successfullyidentified a control strategy that yields a drag reduction of approximately10%. The optimal control law features a strong, low-frequency actuation fromthe bottom jet, which targets the main vortex shedding, while the top andlateral jets address higher-frequency, less energetic phenomena. Particle ImageVelocimetry analysis reveals a significant upward shift and stabilization ofthe wake, leading to substantial pressure recovery on the model's lower base.Ultimately, this work demonstrates that a model-free optimization approach cansuccessfully identify non-intuitive, multi-faceted actuation strategies thatyield significant and energetically efficient drag reduction.</description><author>Isaac Robledo, Juan Alfaro, Víctor Duro, Alberto Solera-Rico, Rodrigo Castellanos, Carlos Sanmiguel Vila</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:20:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26718v1</guid></item><item><title>On Purely Private Covariance Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26717v1</link><description>We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensionalcovariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy.

Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled approach tofuse such complementary representations through kernel multiplication.Multiplying the kernel similarity functions of two embeddings allows theirdiscriminative structures to interact, producing a fused representation whosekernel encodes the union of the clusters identified by each parent embedding.This formulation also provides a natural way to construct joint kernels forpaired multi-modal data (e.g., image-text tuples), where the product ofmodality-specific kernels inherits structure from both domains. We highlightthat this kernel product is mathematically realized via the Kronecker productof the embedding feature maps, yielding our proposed KrossFuse framework forembedding fusion. To address the computational cost of the resultinghigh-dimensional Kronecker space, we further develop RP-KrossFuse, a scalablevariant that leverages random projections for efficient approximation. As a keyapplication, we use this framework to bridge the performance gap betweencross-modal embeddings (e.g., CLIP, BLIP) and unimodal experts (e.g., DINOv2,E5).

While current LargeReasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to performfast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work,we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speedadjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addressestwo key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when toadjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify thesteering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs'representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representationediting-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-basedscaling methods.

However, RLHF struggles withinterpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments thatusually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focuson correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with BinaryFlexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-drivenpreferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling rewardmodels to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural languagefeedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training asan entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitraryprinciple). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperformBradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance onRM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,2025).

Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating thealignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by whichmodels learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and atwhich stage value alignment arises during the course of a model'spost-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-trainingalgorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value driftsduring training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of differentsizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimizationdatasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes amodel's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns thesevalues. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enablescontrolled manipulation of values, we find that different preferenceoptimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even whenpreference data is held constant.

Our results highlight the need forfurther research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-awareauthorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, includingfine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).</description><author>Majed El Helou, Chiara Troiani, Benjamin Ryder, Jean Diaconu, Hervé Muyal, Marcelo Yannuzzi</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:07:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26702v1</guid></item><item><title>Curriculum Abductive Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12275v2</link><description>Abductive Learning (ABL) integrates machine learning with logical reasoningin a loop: a learning model predicts symbolic concept labels from raw inputs,which are revised through abduction using domain knowledge and then fed backfor retraining. However, due to the nondeterminism of abduction, the trainingprocess often suffers from instability, especially when the knowledge base islarge and complex, resulting in a prohibitively large abduction space. Whileprior works focus on improving candidate selection within this space, theytypically treat the knowledge base as a static black box. In this work, wepropose Curriculum Abductive Learning (C-ABL), a method that explicitlyleverages the internal structure of the knowledge base to address the ABLtraining challenges. C-ABL partitions the knowledge base into a sequence ofsub-bases, progressively introduced during training. This reduces the abductionspace throughout training and enables the model to incorporate logic in astepwise, smooth way. Experiments across multiple tasks show that C-ABLoutperforms previous ABL implementations, significantly improves trainingstability, convergence speed, and final accuracy, especially under complexknowledge setting.</description><author>Wen-Chao Hu, Qi-Jie Li, Lin-Han Jia, Cunjing Ge, Yu-Feng Li, Yuan Jiang, Zhi-Hua Zhou</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:06:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12275v2</guid></item><item><title>Assessment of the conditional exchangeability assumption in causal machine learning models: a simulation study</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26700v1</link><description>Observational studies developing causal machine learning (ML) models for theprediction of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) seldom conduct empiricalevaluations to assess the conditional exchangeability assumption. We aimed toevaluate the performance of these models under conditional exchangeabilityviolations and the utility of negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a diagnostic.We conducted a simulation study to examine confounding bias in ITE estimatesgenerated by causal forest and X-learner models under varying conditions,including the presence or absence of true heterogeneity. We simulated data toreflect real-world scenarios with differing levels of confounding, sample size,and NCO confounding structures. We then estimated and compared subgroup-leveltreatment effects on the primary outcome and NCOs across settings with andwithout unmeasured confounding. When conditional exchangeability was violated,causal forest and X-learner models failed to recover true treatment effectheterogeneity and, in some cases, falsely indicated heterogeneity when therewas none. NCOs successfully identified subgroups affected by unmeasuredconfounding. Even when NCOs did not perfectly satisfy its ideal assumptions, itremained informative, flagging potential bias in subgroup level estimates,though not always pinpointing the subgroup with the largest confounding.Violations of conditional exchangeability substantially limit the validity ofITE estimates from causal ML models in routinely collected observational data.NCOs serve a useful empirical diagnostic tool for detecting subgroup-specificunmeasured confounding and should be incorporated into causal ML workflows tosupport the credibility of individualized inference.</description><author>Gerard T.

However, in practice, data availability oftenexhibits a hybrid nature, where both regimes coexist. This hybrid settingpresents new opportunities for model training, as the two regimes offercomplementary trade-offs: decentralized data is abundant but subject toheterogeneity and communication constraints, while centralized data, thoughlimited in volume and potentially unrepresentative, enables better curation andhigh-throughput access. Despite its potential, effectively combining theseparadigms remains challenging, and few frameworks are tailored to hybrid dataregimes. To address this, we propose a novel framework that constructs a modelatlas from decentralized models and leverages centralized data to refine aglobal model within this structured space. The refined model is then used toreinitialize the decentralized models. Our method synergizes federated learning(to exploit decentralized data) and model merging (to utilize centralizeddata), enabling effective training under hybrid data availability.Theoretically, we show that our approach achieves faster convergence thanmethods relying solely on decentralized data, due to variance reduction in themerging process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our frameworkconsistently outperforms purely centralized, purely decentralized, and existinghybrid-adaptable methods. Notably, our method remains robust even when thecentralized and decentralized data domains differ or when decentralized datacontains noise, significantly broadening its applicability.</description><author>Junyi Zhu, Ruicong Yao, Taha Ceritli, Savas Ozkan, Matthew B.

In practice, they depend on anon-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning ofhyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, anovel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning tocontrol its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer withlightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specifictemperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approachtransforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the modelto self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass. Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate thatAutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies butalso achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decodingcontrol: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-pon a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactiveLLM decoding.</description><author>Zhichao Wang, Dongyang Ma, Xinting Huang, Deng Cai, Tian Lan, Jiahao Xu, Haitao Mi, Xiaoying Tang, Yan Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:01:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26697v1</guid></item><item><title>The Impact and Outlook of 3D Gaussian Splatting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26694v1</link><description>Since its introduction, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly transformedthe landscape of 3D scene representations, inspiring an extensive body ofassociated research.

At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), anexpressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with afiner-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limitedfinite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardwareefficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to thegeneral DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classicaldelta rule. We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B totalparameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linearoutperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, whilereducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decodingthroughput for a 1M context.

The search space of gate sequences grows combinatorially, andhandcrafted templates often waste scarce qubit and depth budgets. We introduce\textsc{FlowQ-Net} (Flow-based Quantum design Network), a generative frameworkfor automated quantum circuit synthesis based on Generative Flow Networks(GFlowNets). This framework learns a stochastic policy to construct circuitssequentially, sampling them in proportion to a flexible, user-defined rewardfunction that can encode multiple design objectives such as performance, depth,and gate count. This approach uniquely enables the generation of a diverseensemble of high-quality circuits, moving beyond single-solution optimization.We demonstrate the efficacy of \textsc{FlowQ-Net} through an extensive set ofsimulations. We apply our method to Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) ansatzdesign for molecular ground state estimation, Max-Cut, and imageclassification, key challenges in near-term quantum computing. Circuitsdesigned by \textsc{FlowQ-Net} achieve significant improvements, yieldingcircuits that are 10$\times$-30$\times$ more compact in terms of parameters,gates, and depth compared to commonly used unitary baselines, withoutcompromising accuracy. This trend holds even when subjected to error profilesfrom real-world quantum devices.

Recent effortshave replaced this norm with a structural sparsity regularizer, such as thenuclear group norm, to craft group-wise sparse adversarial attacks. Theresulting perturbations are thus explainable and hold significant practicalrelevance, shedding light on an even greater vulnerability of DNNs. However,crafting such attacks poses an optimization challenge, as it involves computingnorms for groups of pixels within a non-convex objective. We address this bypresenting a two-phase algorithm that generates group-wise sparse attackswithin semantically meaningful areas of an image. Initially, we optimize aquasinorm adversarial loss using the $1/2-$quasinorm proximal operator tailoredfor non-convex programming. Subsequently, the algorithm transitions to aprojected Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent with $2-$norm regularizationapplied to perturbation magnitudes. Rigorous evaluations on CIFAR-10 andImageNet datasets demonstrate a remarkable increase in group-wise sparsity,e.g., $50.9\%$ on CIFAR-10 and $38.4\%$ on ImageNet (average case, targetedattack).

In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase underGaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussianmechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input.

Thischallenge is particularly exemplified in histopathology image analysis, wherethe same tissue structures must be segmented across images captured underdifferent imaging conditions (stains), each representing a distinct visualdomain. Traditional deep learning methods like UNet require extensive labels,which is both costly and time-consuming, particularly when dealing withmultiple domains (or stains). To mitigate this, various unsupervised domainadaptation based methods such as UDAGAN have been proposed, which reduce theneed for labels by requiring only one (source) stain to be labelled.Nonetheless, obtaining source stain labels can still be challenging. Thisarticle shows that through self-supervised pre-training -- including SimCLR,BYOL, and a novel approach, HR-CS-CO -- the performance of these segmentationmethods (UNet, and UDAGAN) can be retained even with 95% fewer labels. Notably,with self-supervised pre-training and using only 5% labels, the performancedrops are minimal: 5.9% for UNet and 6.2% for UDAGAN, averaged over all stains,compared to their respective fully supervised counterparts (withoutpre-training, using 100% labels).

We proposeCronusVLA, a unified framework that extends single-frame VLA models to themulti-frame paradigm. CronusVLA follows a two-stage process: (1) Single-framepretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive prediction ofaction tokens, establishing an effective embodied vision-language foundation;(2) Multi-frame post-training, which adapts the prediction of thevision-language backbone from discrete tokens to learnable features, andaggregates historical information via feature chunking.

While human feedback is essential for improving dataquality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduceRefine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM asboth a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existingiterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generaterefinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that everyiteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional humanannotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a responseand judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer.This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over therefinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences ofincreasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of publicdatasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, andconversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned onRefine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% ofcomparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4.Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench.

An open question is how systematic this interpretation processis. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark forinvestigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions areactually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varyingdifficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica forverbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in orderto test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, giventhat they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate towhat degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they"understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of differentsizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well asfine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degradesfrom $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from thesamples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to themodel in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset oflowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically andcompositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.</description><author>David Maria Schmidt, Raoul Schubert, Philipp Cimiano</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 16:25:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21257v2</guid></item><item><title>The Era of Agentic Organization: Learning to Organize with Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26658v1</link><description>We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solvecomplex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomesbeyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduceasynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with largelanguage models, which organizes the internal thinking process intoconcurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinkingprotocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, mergesintermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, thethinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized throughreinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracyon mathematical reasoning.

LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remainsconstant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to moredescriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead tosuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we proposethree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets theposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integratedinto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We firstexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics usingstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristicsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamicdeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finerlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs.

While optical flow, a computervision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysicalproblems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical opticalflow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning basedapproaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard incomputer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. Wepresent the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow modelson RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) andFl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometeraccuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to thespatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in theArctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturingconsistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based opticalflow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracycompared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remotesensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providingmotion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.</description><author>Daniela Martin, Joseph Gallego</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 16:20:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26653v1</guid></item><item><title>Hybrid DQN-TD3 Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Navigation in Dynamic Environments</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26646v1</link><description>This paper presents a hierarchical path-planning and control framework thatcombines a high-level Deep Q-Network (DQN) for discrete sub-goal selection witha low-level Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) controllerfor continuous actuation.

Such models relyon key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithfullearning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The defacto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least actionthat results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing anenergy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-worldsystems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibitnon-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured bycurrent state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In thispaper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that iscapable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving aSchr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- instark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which isconstructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for singlecells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximatevelocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that bettermatch both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expandsflow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards themodeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems.

Therefore, the only scalable and viablesolution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collectedfrom diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods torun. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable totime series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-basedapproaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paperstudies the performance of time series classification methods used as modelselection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurationsderived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and wepropose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time seriesclassification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our resultsdemonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomalydetection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding executiontime. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy andefficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, andrepresents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selectionstep in general AutoML pipelines.

While recent breakthroughs inComputer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkableprogress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remainsfragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperativeintelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-lookinganalysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such asVision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AIrather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematicallyreviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only theircapabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also theirpotential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perceptionframeworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets thatmoves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by across-analysis of data structures and characteristics.

Attribution patching offers afaster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reducedreliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduceRelevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attributionpatching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise RelevancePropagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through thelayers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to localpropagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation orimproved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires onlytwo forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiencywhile improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models andtasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching thanstandard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream andMLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, forMLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlationof 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered byRelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuitsidentified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achievescomparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated withIG.</description><author>Farnoush Rezaei Jafari, Oliver Eberle, Ashkan Khakzar, Neel Nanda</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 16:01:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21258v2</guid></item><item><title>PT-DETR: Small Target Detection Based on Partially-Aware Detail Focus</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26630v1</link><description>To address the challenges in UAV object detection, such as complexbackgrounds, severe occlusion, dense small objects, and varying lightingconditions,this paper proposes PT-DETR based on RT-DETR, a novel detectionalgorithm specifically designed for small objects in UAV imagery.

Although existing deepfake detectionmodels demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methodsonly provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability.Recent studies have attempted to enhance the interpretability of classificationresults by providing spatial manipulation masks or temporal forgery segments.However, due to the limitations of forgery datasets, the practicaleffectiveness of these methods remains suboptimal. The primary reason lies inthe fact that most existing deepfake datasets contain only binary labels, withlimited variety in forgery scenarios, insufficient diversity in deepfake types,and relatively small data scales, making them inadequate for complex real-worldscenarios.To address this predicament, we construct a novel large-scaledeepfake detection and localization (\textbf{DDL}) dataset containing over$\textbf{1.4M+}$ forged samples and encompassing up to $\textbf{80}$ distinctdeepfake methods. The DDL design incorporates four key innovations: (1)\textbf{Comprehensive Deepfake Methods} (covering 7 different generationarchitectures and a total of 80 methods), (2) \textbf{Varied ManipulationModes} (incorporating 7 classic and 3 novel forgery modes), (3) \textbf{DiverseForgery Scenarios and Modalities} (including 3 scenarios and 3 modalities), and(4) \textbf{Fine-grained Forgery Annotations} (providing 1.18M+ precise spatialmasks and 0.23M+ precise temporal segments).Through these improvements, our DDLnot only provides a more challenging benchmark for complex real-world forgeriesbut also offers crucial support for building next-generation deepfakedetection, localization, and interpretability methods.</description><author>Changtao Miao, Yi Zhang, Weize Gao, Zhiya Tan, Weiwei Feng, Man Luo, Jianshu Li, Ajian Liu, Yunfeng Diao, Qi Chu, Tao Gong, Zhe Li, Weibin Yao, Joey Tianyi Zhou</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 15:53:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23292v2</guid></item><item><title>Encoder-Decoder or Decoder-Only?

Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN forinstruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compellingscaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overallmore compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scalingand context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLMachieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks whileenjoying substantially better inference efficiency.

Generative modelsprovide continuous latent "maps" of peptide space, but conventionally ignoredecoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, renderingexploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-basedremedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails inpractice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-awareframework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define aUnion of $\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\mathbb{M}^{\kappa}$, a familyof decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuringcomputational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-OrderRiemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergentsecond-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and MutationEnumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discreteamino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration BayesianOptimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization.Finally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), whichinterpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics,biasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitrovalidation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novelseeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly activepeptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterialstrains.

To address this issue, several classicalstatistical learning approaches have been repurposed for scalableuncertainty-aware LoRA fine-tuning. However, these approaches neglect how inputcharacteristics affect the predictive uncertainty estimates. To address thislimitation, we propose Contextual Low-Rank Adaptation (C-LoRA) as a noveluncertainty-aware and parameter efficient fine-tuning approach, by developingnew lightweight LoRA modules contextualized to each input data sample todynamically adapt uncertainty estimates. Incorporating data-driven contextsinto the parameter posteriors, C-LoRA mitigates overfitting, achieveswell-calibrated uncertainties, and yields robust predictions. Extensiveexperiments on LLaMA2-7B models demonstrate that C-LoRA consistentlyoutperforms the state-of-the-art uncertainty-aware LoRA methods in bothuncertainty quantification and model generalization. Ablation studies furtherconfirm the critical role of our contextual modules in capturingsample-specific uncertainties. C-LoRA sets a new standard for robust,uncertainty-aware LLM fine-tuning in few-shot regimes. Although our experimentsare limited to 7B models, our method is architecture-agnostic and, inprinciple, applies beyond this scale; studying its scaling to larger modelsremains an open problem.

Our method jointly learns a latentspace and a group representation in which group actions correspond toinvertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structuredtransformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with groupoperations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we furthervalidate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and thegeneral linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof foridentifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types onreal-world data remains future work, our results constitute the firstsuccessful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learningfrom group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groupsand a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computervision.</description><author>Tobias Schmidt, Steffen Schneider, Matthias Bethge</author><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 17:59:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21706v1</guid></item></channel></rss>
