Yet, thesetechniques often fail to accurately capture the inter-relation between theobject, ground, and camera. As a result, the reconstructed objects often appearfloating or tilted when placed on flat surfaces. This limitation significantlyaffects 3D-aware image editing applications like shadow rendering and objectpose manipulation. To address this issue, we introduce ORG (ObjectReconstruction with Ground), a novel task aimed at reconstructing 3D objectgeometry in conjunction with the ground surface. Our method uses two compactpixel-level representations to depict the relationship between camera, object,and ground. Experiments show that the proposed ORG model can effectivelyreconstruct object-ground geometry on unseen data, significantly enhancing thequality of shadow generation and pose manipulation compared to conventionalsingle-image 3D reconstruction techniques.</description><author>Yunze Man, Yichen Sheng, Jianming Zhang, Liang-Yan Gui, Yu-Xiong Wang</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 17:59:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18914v1</guid></item><item><title>SOAP-RL: Sequential Option Advantage Propagation for Reinforcement Learning in POMDP Environments</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18913v1</link><description>This work compares ways of extending Reinforcement Learning algorithms toPartially Observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with options. One view ofoptions is as temporally extended action, which can be realized as a memorythat allows the agent to retain historical information beyond the policy'scontext window. While option assignment could be handled using heuristics andhand-crafted objectives, learning temporally consistent options and associatedsub-policies without explicit supervision is a challenge. Two algorithms, PPOEMand SOAP, are proposed and studied in depth to address this problem. PPOEMapplies the forward-backward algorithm (for Hidden Markov Models) to optimizethe expected returns for an option-augmented policy. However, this learningapproach is unstable during on-policy rollouts. It is also unsuited forlearning causal policies without the knowledge of future trajectories, sinceoption assignments are optimized for offline sequences where the entire episodeis available. As an alternative approach, SOAP evaluates the policy gradientfor an optimal option assignment. It extends the concept of the generalizedadvantage estimation (GAE) to propagate option advantages through time, whichis an analytical equivalent to performing temporal back-propagation of optionpolicy gradients. This option policy is only conditional on the history of theagent, not future actions. Evaluated against competing baselines, SOAPexhibited the most robust performance, correctly discovering options for POMDPcorridor environments, as well as on standard benchmarks including Atari andMuJoCo, outperforming PPOEM, as well as LSTM and Option-Critic baselines.

However, learningsuch a representation requires an extreme amount of diverse training data,which is prohibitively expensive to collect on a real robot. How can weovercome this problem? Instead of collecting more robot data, this paperproposes using internet-scale, human videos to extract "affordances," both atthe environment and agent level, and distill them into a pre-trainedrepresentation. We present a simple framework for pre-training representationson hand, object, and contact "affordance labels" that highlight relevantobjects in images and how to interact with them. These affordances areautomatically extracted from human video data (with the help of off-the-shelfcomputer vision modules) and used to fine-tune existing representations. Ourapproach can efficiently fine-tune *any* existing representation, and resultsin models with stronger downstream robotic performance across the board. Weexperimentally demonstrate (using 3000+ robot trials) that this affordancepre-training scheme boosts performance by a minimum of 15% on 5 real-worldtasks, which consider three diverse robot morphologies (including a dexteroushand). Unlike prior works in the space, these representations improveperformance across 3 different camera views. Quantitatively, we find that ourapproach leads to higher levels of generalization in out-of-distributionsettings.

Light Post-Training Graph-ODE for Efficient Recommendation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18910v1</link><description>The efficiency and scalability of graph convolution networks (GCNs) intraining recommender systems (RecSys) have been persistent concerns, hinderingtheir deployment in real-world applications. This paper presents a criticalexamination of the necessity of graph convolutions during the training phaseand introduces an innovative alternative: the Light Post-Training GraphOrdinary-Differential-Equation (LightGODE). Our investigation reveals that thebenefits of GCNs are more pronounced during testing rather than training.Motivated by this, LightGODE utilizes a novel post-training graph convolutionmethod that bypasses the computation-intensive message passing of GCNs andemploys a non-parametric continuous graph ordinary-differential-equation (ODE)to dynamically model node representations. This approach drastically reducestraining time while achieving fine-grained post-training graph convolution toavoid the distortion of the original training embedding space, termed theembedding discrepancy issue. We validate our model across several real-worlddatasets of different scales, demonstrating that LightGODE not only outperformsGCN-based models in terms of efficiency and effectiveness but alsosignificantly mitigates the embedding discrepancy commonly associated withdeeper graph convolution layers. Our LightGODE challenges the prevailingparadigms in RecSys training and suggests re-evaluating the role of graphconvolutions, potentially guiding future developments of efficient large-scalegraph-based RecSys.</description><author>Weizhi Zhang, Liangwei Yang, Zihe Song, Henry Peng Zou, Ke Xu, Henry Peng Zou, Liancheng Fang, Philip S.

In this paper, we present a hybrid approach, where such physics-basedsummaries are augmented by a set of compressed neural summary statistics thatare optimised to extract the extra information that is not captured by thepredefined summaries. The resulting statistics are very powerful inputs tosimulation-based or implicit inference of model parameters. We apply thisgeneralisation of Information Maximising Neural Networks (IMNNs) to parameterconstraints from tomographic weak gravitational lensing convergence maps tofind summary statistics that are explicitly optimised to complement angularpower spectrum estimates. We study several dark matter simulation resolutionsin low- and high-noise regimes. We show that i) the information-updateformalism extracts at least $3\times$ and up to $8\times$ as much informationas the angular power spectrum in all noise regimes, ii) the network summariesare highly complementary to existing 2-point summaries, and iii) our formalismallows for networks with smaller, physically-informed architectures to matchmuch larger regression networks with far fewer simulations needed to obtainasymptotically optimal inference.</description><author>T.

Regression-based methods that directly predict graspingparameters given the object may achieve a high success rate but often lackdiversity. Generation-based methods that generate grasping postures conditionedon the object can often produce diverse grasping, but they are insufficient forhigh grasping success due to lack of discriminative information. To mitigate,we introduce a unified diffusion-based dexterous grasp generation model, dubbedthe name UGG, which operates within the object point cloud and hand parameterspaces. Our all-transformer architecture unifies the information from theobject, the hand, and the contacts, introducing a novel representation ofcontact points for improved contact modeling. The flexibility and quality ofour model enable the integration of a lightweight discriminator, benefitingfrom simulated discriminative data, which pushes for a high success rate whilepreserving high diversity. Beyond grasp generation, our model can also generateobjects based on hand information, offering valuable insights into objectdesign and studying how the generative model perceives objects. Our modelachieves state-of-the-art dexterous grasping on the large-scale DexGraspNetdataset while facilitating human-centric object design, marking a significantadvancement in dexterous grasping research.

Wolf is an automated captioning framework that adopts amixture-of-experts approach, leveraging complementary strengths of VisionLanguage Models (VLMs). By utilizing both image and video models, our frameworkcaptures different levels of information and summarizes them efficiently. Ourapproach can be applied to enhance video understanding, auto-labeling, andcaptioning. To evaluate caption quality, we introduce CapScore, an LLM-basedmetric to assess the similarity and quality of generated captions compared tothe ground truth captions. We further build four human-annotated datasets inthree domains: autonomous driving, general scenes, and robotics, to facilitatecomprehensive comparisons. We show that Wolf achieves superior captioningperformance compared to state-of-the-art approaches from the research community(VILA1.5, CogAgent) and commercial solutions (Gemini-Pro-1.5, GPT-4V). Forinstance, in comparison with GPT-4V, Wolf improves CapScore both quality-wiseby 55.6% and similarity-wise by 77.4% on challenging driving videos. Finally,we establish a benchmark for video captioning and introduce a leaderboard,aiming to accelerate advancements in video understanding, captioning, and dataalignment.

Popularised byDensePose for the analysis of humans, authors have since attempted to apply theconcept to more categories, but with limited success due to the high cost ofmanual supervision. In this work, we introduce SHIC, a method to learncanonical maps without manual supervision which achieves better results thansupervised methods for most categories. Our idea is to leverage foundationcomputer vision models such as DINO and Stable Diffusion that are open-endedand thus possess excellent priors over natural categories. SHIC reduces theproblem of estimating image-to-template correspondences to predictingimage-to-image correspondences using features from the foundation models. Thereduction works by matching images of the object to non-photorealistic rendersof the template, which emulates the process of collecting manual annotationsfor this task. These correspondences are then used to supervise high-qualitycanonical maps for any object of interest. We also show that image generatorscan further improve the realism of the template views, which provide anadditional source of supervision for the model.</description><author>Aleksandar Shtedritski, Christian Rupprecht, Andrea Vedaldi</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 17:58:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18907v1</guid></item><item><title>A Scalable Quantum Non-local Neural Network for Image Classification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18906v1</link><description>Non-local operations play a crucial role in computer vision enabling thecapture of long-range dependencies through weighted sums of features across theinput, surpassing the constraints of traditional convolution operations thatfocus solely on local neighborhoods. Non-local operations typically requirecomputing pairwise relationships between all elements in a set, leading toquadratic complexity in terms of time and memory. Due to the high computationaland memory demands, scaling non-local neural networks to large-scale problemscan be challenging. This article introduces a hybrid quantum-classical scalablenon-local neural network, referred to as Quantum Non-Local Neural Network(QNL-Net), to enhance pattern recognition. The proposed QNL-Net relies oninherent quantum parallelism to allow the simultaneous processing of a largenumber of input features enabling more efficient computations inquantum-enhanced feature space and involving pairwise relationships throughquantum entanglement. We benchmark our proposed QNL-Net with other quantumcounterparts to binary classification with datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10. Thesimulation findings showcase our QNL-Net achieves cutting-edge accuracy levelsin binary image classification among quantum classifiers while utilizing fewerqubits.</description><author>Sparsh Gupta, Debanjan Konar, Vaneet Aggarwal</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 17:58:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18906v1</guid></item><item><title>Lessons from Learning to Spin "Pens"</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18902v1</link><description>In-hand manipulation of pen-like objects is an important skill in our dailylives, as many tools such as hammers and screwdrivers are similarly shaped.However, current learning-based methods struggle with this task due to a lackof high-quality demonstrations and the significant gap between simulation andthe real world. In this work, we push the boundaries of learning-based in-handmanipulation systems by demonstrating the capability to spin pen-like objects.We first use reinforcement learning to train an oracle policy with privilegedinformation and generate a high-fidelity trajectory dataset in simulation. Thisserves two purposes: 1) pre-training a sensorimotor policy in simulation; 2)conducting open-loop trajectory replay in the real world. We then fine-tune thesensorimotor policy using these real-world trajectories to adapt it to the realworld dynamics. With less than 50 trajectories, our policy learns to rotatemore than ten pen-like objects with different physical properties for multiplerevolutions. We present a comprehensive analysis of our design choices andshare the lessons learned during development.</description><author>Jun Wang, Ying Yuan, Haichuan Che, Haozhi Qi, Yi Ma, Jitendra Malik, Xiaolong Wang</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 17:56:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18902v1</guid></item><item><title>AppWorld: A Controllable World of Apps and People for Benchmarking Interactive Coding Agents</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18901v1</link><description>Autonomous agents that address day-to-day digital tasks (e.g., orderinggroceries for a household), must not only operate multiple apps (e.g., notes,messaging, shopping app) via APIs, but also generate rich code with complexcontrol flow in an iterative manner based on their interaction with theenvironment. However, existing benchmarks for tool use are inadequate, as theyonly cover tasks that require a simple sequence of API calls. To remedy this gap, we built $\textbf{AppWorld Engine}$, a high-qualityexecution environment (60K lines of code) of 9 day-to-day apps operable via 457APIs and populated with realistic digital activities simulating the lives of~100 fictitious users. We then created $\textbf{AppWorld Benchmark}$ (40K linesof code), a suite of 750 natural, diverse, and challenging autonomous agenttasks requiring rich and interactive code generation. It supports robustprogrammatic evaluation with state-based unit tests, allowing for differentways of completing a task while also checking for unexpected changes, i.e.,collateral damage. The state-of-the-art LLM, GPT-4o, solves only ~49% of our'normal' tasks and ~30% of 'challenge' tasks, while other models solve at least16% fewer. This highlights the benchmark's difficulty and AppWorld's potentialto push the frontiers of interactive coding agents.

However, the governance anddevelopment of AI still remain in the hands of a few, and the pace ofdevelopment is accelerating without a comprehensive assessment of risks. As afirst step towards democratic risk assessment and design of general purpose AI,we introduce PARTICIP-AI, a carefully designed framework for laypeople tospeculate and assess AI use cases and their impacts. Our framework allows us tostudy more nuanced and detailed public opinions on AI through collecting usecases, surfacing diverse harms through risk assessment under alternatescenarios (i.e., developing and not developing a use case), and illuminatingtensions over AI development through making a concluding choice on itsdevelopment. To showcase the promise of our framework towards informingdemocratic AI development, we run a medium-scale study with inputs from 295demographically diverse participants. Our analyses show that participants'responses emphasize applications for personal life and society, contrastingwith most current AI development's business focus. We also surface diverse setof envisioned harms such as distrust in AI and institutions, complementary tothose defined by experts. Furthermore, we found that perceived impact of notdeveloping use cases significantly predicted participants' judgements ofwhether AI use cases should be developed, and highlighted lay users' concernsof techno-solutionism. We conclude with a discussion on how frameworks likePARTICIP-AI can further guide democratic AI development and governance.</description><author>Jimin Mun, Liwei Jiang, Jenny Liang, Inyoung Cheong, Nicole DeCario, Yejin Choi, Tadayoshi Kohno, Maarten Sap</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 17:52:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14791v2</guid></item><item><title>Learn from the Learnt: Source-Free Active Domain Adaptation via Contrastive Sampling and Visual Persistence</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18899v1</link><description>Domain Adaptation (DA) facilitates knowledge transfer from a source domain toa related target domain. This paper investigates a practical DA paradigm,namely Source data-Free Active Domain Adaptation (SFADA), where source databecomes inaccessible during adaptation, and a minimum amount of annotationbudget is available in the target domain. Without referencing the source data,new challenges emerge in identifying the most informative target samples forlabeling, establishing cross-domain alignment during adaptation, and ensuringcontinuous performance improvements through the iterative query-and-adaptationprocess. In response, we present learn from the learnt (LFTL), a novel paradigmfor SFADA to leverage the learnt knowledge from the source pretrained model andactively iterated models without extra overhead. We propose Contrastive ActiveSampling to learn from the hypotheses of the preceding model, thereby queryingtarget samples that are both informative to the current model and persistentlychallenging throughout active learning. During adaptation, we learn fromfeatures of actively selected anchors obtained from previous intermediatemodels, so that the Visual Persistence-guided Adaptation can facilitate featuredistribution alignment and active sample exploitation. Extensive experiments onthree widely-used benchmarks show that our LFTL achieves state-of-the-artperformance, superior computational efficiency and continuous improvements asthe annotation budget increases.

Eventhe strongest proprietary large language models (LLMs) do not quite exhibit theability of continually improving their responses sequentially, even inscenarios where they are explicitly told that they are making a mistake. Inthis paper, we develop RISE: Recursive IntroSpEction, an approach forfine-tuning LLMs to introduce this capability, despite prior work hypothesizingthat this capability may not be possible to attain. Our approach prescribes aniterative fine-tuning procedure, which attempts to teach the model how to alterits response after having executed previously unsuccessful attempts to solve ahard test-time problem, with optionally additional environment feedback. RISEposes fine-tuning for a single-turn prompt as solving a multi-turn Markovdecision process (MDP), where the initial state is the prompt. Inspired byprinciples in online imitation learning and reinforcement learning, we proposestrategies for multi-turn data collection and training so as to imbue an LLMwith the capability to recursively detect and correct its previous mistakes insubsequent iterations. Our experiments show that RISE enables Llama2, Llama3,and Mistral models to improve themselves with more turns on math reasoningtasks, outperforming several single-turn strategies given an equal amount ofinference-time computation. We also find that RISE scales well, often attaininglarger benefits with more capable models. Our analysis shows that RISE makesmeaningful improvements to responses to arrive at the correct solution forchallenging prompts, without disrupting one-turn abilities as a result ofexpressing more complex distributions.</description><author>Yuxiao Qu, Tianjun Zhang, Naman Garg, Aviral Kumar</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 17:50:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18219v2</guid></item><item><title>SHANGUS: Deep Reinforcement Learning Meets Heuristic Optimization for Speedy Frontier-Based Exploration of Autonomous Vehicles in Unknown Spaces</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18892v1</link><description>This paper introduces SHANGUS, an advanced framework combining DeepReinforcement Learning (DRL) with heuristic optimization to improvefrontier-based exploration efficiency in unknown environments, particularly forintelligent vehicles in autonomous air services, search and rescue operations,and space exploration robotics.

Recent works on preferenceelicitation advocate for active learning as an efficient method to iterativelyconstruct queries (framed as comparisons between context-specific cases) thatare likely to be most informative about an agent's underlying preferences. Inthis work, we argue that the use of active learning for moral preferenceelicitation relies on certain assumptions about the underlying moralpreferences, which can be violated in practice. Specifically, we highlight thefollowing common assumptions (a) preferences are stable over time and notsensitive to the sequence of presented queries, (b) the appropriate hypothesisclass is chosen to model moral preferences, and (c) noise in the agent'sresponses is limited. While these assumptions can be appropriate for preferenceelicitation in certain domains, prior research on moral psychology suggeststhey may not be valid for moral judgments. Through a synthetic simulation ofpreferences that violate the above assumptions, we observe that active learningcan have similar or worse performance than a basic random query selectionmethod in certain settings. Yet, simulation results also demonstrate thatactive learning can still be viable if the degree of instability or noise isrelatively small and when the agent's preferences can be approximatelyrepresented with the hypothesis class used for learning. Our study highlightsthe nuances associated with effective moral preference elicitation in practiceand advocates for the cautious use of active learning as a methodology to learnmoral preferences.</description><author>Vijay Keswani, Vincent Conitzer, Hoda Heidari, Jana Schaich Borg, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 17:40:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18889v1</guid></item><item><title>Embedding And Clustering Your Data Can Improve Contrastive Pretraining</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18887v1</link><description>Recent studies of large-scale contrastive pretraining in the text embeddingdomain show that using single-source minibatches, rather than mixed-sourceminibatches, can substantially improve overall model accuracy.

Firstly, through Spearman correlation analysis of CPU,usage, memory usage, network traffic, power consumption, number of instructionsexecuted, execution time and energy efficiency, we found that power consumptionhas the highest degree of positive correlation with energy efficiency, whileCPU usage has the highest degree of negative correlation with energyefficiency. In our experiments, we introduced a random forest model and anoptimisation model based on the horned lizard optimisation algorithm fortesting, and the results show that the optimisation algorithm has betterprediction results compared to the random forest model. Specifically, the meansquare error (MSE) of the optimisation algorithm is 0.01 smaller than that ofthe random forest model, and the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.01 smaller thanthat of the random forest.3 The results of the combined metrics show that theoptimisation algorithm performs more accurately and reliably in predictingenergy efficiency. This research result provides new ideas and methods toimprove the energy efficiency of cloud computing systems. This research notonly expands the scope of application in the field of cloud computing, but alsoprovides a strong support for improving the energy use efficiency of thesystem.</description><author>Feiyang Li, Zinan Cao, Qixuan Yu, Xirui Tang</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 17:35:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14575v2</guid></item><item><title>How Well Can a Long Sequence Model Model Long Sequences?

Deep neural networks,however, have often struggled with these for a variety of reasons. Recentadvances, both in system engineering as well as model design, have enabled thescaling up of model that are purported to support extended context length. Inparticular, the state-space and linear recurrent neural network families ofmodels hypothetically can entend to infinite sequence lenth. However, is thistoo good to be true? We conduct an evaluation to show that while such claimsmay be sound theoretically, there remain large practical gaps that areempirically observed.

Tomitigate these challenges, existing studies commonly incorporate additionalmodal information matching the visual data to regularize the model's learningprocess, enabling the extraction of high-quality visual features from compleximage regions. Specifically, in the realm of multimodal learning, cross-modalalignment is recognized as an effective strategy, harmonizing different modalinformation by learning a domain-consistent latent feature space for visual andsemantic features. However, this approach may face limitations due to theheterogeneity between multimodal information, such as differences in featuredistribution and structure. To address this issue, we introduce a MultimodalAlignment and Reconstruction Network (MARNet), designed to enhance the model'sresistance to visual noise. Importantly, MARNet includes a cross-modaldiffusion reconstruction module for smoothly and stably blending informationacross different domains. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets,Vireo-Food172 and Ingredient-101, demonstrate that MARNet effectively improvesthe quality of image information extracted by the model.

This technique requires a precise balance of local texturereplication and global contextual understanding to ensure the restored imageintegrates seamlessly with its surroundings. Traditional methods usingConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective at capturing local patternsbut often struggle with broader contextual relationships due to the limitedreceptive fields. Recent advancements have incorporated transformers,leveraging their ability to understand global interactions. However, thesemethods face computational inefficiencies and struggle to maintain fine-graineddetails. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MxT composed of theproposed Hybrid Module (HM), which combines Mamba with the transformer in asynergistic manner.

Optimizing such temporalparameters, for example, through gradient descent, gives rise to a temporalarchitecture for different problems. As has been shown in machine learning, toreduce the cost of optimization, architectural biases can be applied, in thiscase in the temporal domain. Such inductive biases in temporal parameters havebeen found in neuroscience studies, highlighting a hierarchy of temporalstructure and input representation in different layers of the cortex. Motivatedby this, we propose to impose a hierarchy of temporal representation in thehidden layers of SNNs, highlighting that such an inductive bias improves theirperformance. We demonstrate the positive effects of temporal hierarchy in thetime constants of feed-forward SNNs applied to temporal tasks (Multi-Time-ScaleXOR and Keyword Spotting, with a benefit of up to 4.1% in classificationaccuracy). Moreover, we show that such architectural biases, i.e. hierarchy oftime constants, naturally emerge when optimizing the time constants throughgradient descent, initialized as homogeneous values. We further pursue thisproposal in temporal convolutional SNNs, by introducing the hierarchical biasin the size and dilation of temporal kernels, giving rise to competitiveresults in popular temporal spike-based datasets.</description><author>Filippo Moro, Pau Vilimelis Aceituno, Laura Kriener, Melika Payvand</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 16:00:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18838v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning to Visually Connect Actions and their Effects</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10805v3</link><description>We introduce the novel concept of visually Connecting Actions and TheirEffects (CATE) in video understanding.

Traditional evolutionary algorithms (EAs), though effective, oftenrely on domain-specific expertise and iterative fine-tuning, hinderingadaptability to unseen MOPs. In recent years, the advent of Large LanguageModels (LLMs) has revolutionized software engineering by enabling theautonomous generation and refinement of programs. Leveraging this breakthrough,we propose a new LLM-based framework that autonomously designs EA operators forsolving MOPs. The proposed framework includes a robust testing module to refinethe generated EA operator through error-driven dialogue with LLMs, a dynamicselection strategy along with informative prompting-based crossover andmutation to fit textual optimization pipeline. Our approach facilitates thedesign of EA operators without the extensive demands for expert intervention,thereby speeding up the innovation of EA operators.

Viewed as a stochastic controlproblem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds an optimal control policy that steersa given joint state statistics to another while minimizing the total controleffort subject to controlled diffusion and deadline constraints. Viewed as astochastic learning problem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds the most-likelydistribution-valued trajectory connecting endpoint distributional observations,i.e., solves the two point boundary-constrained maximum likelihood problem overthe manifold of probability distributions. Recent works have shown that solvingthe Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem with state cost requires finding the Markovkernel associated with a reaction-diffusion PDE where the state cost appears asa state-dependent reaction rate. We explain how ideas from Weyl calculus inquantum mechanics, specifically the Weyl operator and the Weyl symbol, can helpdetermine such Markov kernels. We illustrate these ideas by explicitly findingthe Markov kernel for the case of quadratic state cost via Weyl calculus,recovering our earlier results but avoiding tedious computation with Hermitepolynomials.</description><author>Alexis M.

Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identifiedthousands of variants for multiple complex phenotypes, conventional statisticalapproaches can be limited by simplified assumptions such as linearity and lackof epistasis models. In this work, we trained artificial neural networks forpredicting complex traits using both simulated and real genotype/phenotypedatasets. We extracted feature importance scores via different post hocinterpretability methods to identify potentially associated loci (PAL) for thetarget phenotype. Simulations we performed with various parameters demonstratedthat associated loci can be detected with good precision using strict selectioncriteria, but downstream analyses are required for fine-mapping the exactvariants due to linkage disequilibrium, similarly to conventional GWAS. Byapplying our approach to the schizophrenia cohort in the Estonian Biobank, wewere able to detect multiple PAL related to this highly polygenic and heritabledisorder. We also performed enrichment analyses with PAL in genic regions,which predominantly identified terms associated with brain morphology. Withfurther improvements in model optimization and confidence measures, artificialneural networks can enhance the identification of genomic loci associated withcomplex diseases, providing a more comprehensive approach for GWAS and servingas initial screening tools for subsequent functional studies.

It is a model for which convergence to the $L^2$-optimalpredictor, which is given by the conditional expectation, is establishedtheoretically. Thereby, the training of the model is solely based on a datasetof realizations of the underlying stochastic process, without the need ofknowledge of the law of the process. In the case where the underlying processis deterministic, the conditional expectation coincides with the processitself. Therefore, this framework can equivalently be used to learn thedynamics of ODE or PDE systems solely from realizations of the dynamical systemwith different initial conditions. We showcase the potential of our method byapplying it to the chaotic system of a double pendulum. When training thestandard PD-NJ-ODE method, we see that the prediction starts to diverge fromthe true path after about half of the evaluation time. In this work we enhancethe model with two novel ideas, which independently of each other improve theperformance of our modelling setup. The resulting dynamics match the truedynamics of the chaotic system very closely. The same enhancements can be usedto provably enable the PD-NJ-ODE to learn long-term predictions for generalstochastic datasets, where the standard model fails.

However, this workchallenges this notion by investigating the narrow width limit of the BayesianParallel Branching Graph Neural Network (BPB-GNN), an architecture thatresembles residual networks. We demonstrate that when the width of a BPB-GNN issignificantly smaller compared to the number of training examples, each branchexhibits more robust learning due to a symmetry breaking of branches in kernelrenormalization. Surprisingly, the performance of a BPB-GNN in the narrow widthlimit is generally superior or comparable to that achieved in the wide widthlimit in bias-limited scenarios. Furthermore, the readout norms of each branchin the narrow width limit are mostly independent of the architecturalhyperparameters but generally reflective of the nature of the data. Our resultscharacterize a newly defined narrow-width regime for parallel branchingnetworks in general.</description><author>Zechen Zhang, Haim Sompolinsky</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 15:14:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18807v1</guid></item><item><title>EHR-SeqSQL : A Sequential Text-to-SQL Dataset For Interactively Exploring Electronic Health Records</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00019v2</link><description>In this paper, we introduce EHR-SeqSQL, a novel sequential text-to-SQLdataset for Electronic Health Record (EHR) databases.

Pretraining with contrastive learning enables modelsto extract robust and generalisable features from natural image datasets,facilitating label-efficient downstream image analysis. However, the directapplication of conventional contrastive methods to medical datasets introducestwo domain-specific issues. Firstly, several image transformations which havebeen shown to be crucial for effective contrastive learning do not translatefrom the natural image to the medical image domain. Secondly, the assumptionmade by conventional methods, that any two images are dissimilar, issystematically misleading in medical datasets depicting the same anatomy anddisease. This is exacerbated in longitudinal image datasets that repeatedlyimage the same patient cohort to monitor their disease progression over time.In this paper we tackle these issues by extending conventional contrastiveframeworks with a novel metadata-enhanced strategy. Our approach employs widelyavailable patient metadata to approximate the true set of inter-imagecontrastive relationships. To this end we employ records for patient identity,eye position (i.e. left or right) and time series information. In experimentsusing two large longitudinal datasets containing 170,427 retinal OCT images of7,912 patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), we evaluate theutility of using metadata to incorporate the temporal dynamics of diseaseprogression into pretraining. Our metadata-enhanced approach outperforms bothstandard contrastive methods and a retinal image foundation model in five outof six image-level downstream tasks related to AMD. Due to its modularity, ourmethod can be quickly and cost-effectively tested to establish the potentialbenefits of including available metadata in contrastive pretraining.</description><author>Robbie Holland, Oliver Leingang, Hrvoje Bogunović, Sophie Riedl, Lars Fritsche, Toby Prevost, Hendrik P.

This algorithm is built upon a recursive series of Bayesianposteriors using a method we call Greedy Bayes. Sampling of the Bayesianposterior for neuron weight vectors $w$ of dimension $d$ is challenging becauseof its multimodality. Our algorithm to tackle this problem is based on acoupling of the posterior density for $w$ with an auxiliary random variable$\xi$. The resulting reverse conditional $w|\xi$ of neuron weights given auxiliaryrandom variable is shown to be log concave. In the construction of theposterior distributions we provide some freedom in the choice of the prior. Inparticular, for Gaussian priors on $w$ with suitably small variance, theresulting marginal density of the auxiliary variable $\xi$ is proven to bestrictly log concave for all dimensions $d$. For a uniform prior on the unit$\ell_1$ ball, evidence is given that the density of $\xi$ is again strictlylog concave for sufficiently large $d$. The score of the marginal density of the auxiliary random variable $\xi$ isdetermined by an expectation over $w|\xi$ and thus can be computed by variousrapidly mixing Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, the computation ofthe score of $\xi$ permits methods of sampling $\xi$ by a stochastic diffusion(Langevin dynamics) with drift function built from this score. With suchdynamics, information-theoretic methods pioneered by Bakry and Emery show thataccurate sampling of $\xi$ is obtained rapidly when its density is indeedstrictly log-concave. After which, one more draw from $w|\xi$, produces neuronweights $w$ whose marginal distribution is from the desired posterior.</description><author>Curtis McDonald, Andrew R Barron</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 15:05:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18802v1</guid></item><item><title>Benchmarking Dependence Measures to Prevent Shortcut Learning in Medical Imaging</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18792v1</link><description>Medical imaging cohorts are often confounded by factors such as acquisitiondevices, hospital sites, patient backgrounds, and many more.

These measuresinclude mutual information, distance correlation, and the performance ofadversarial classifiers. Here, we benchmark such dependence measures for thetask of preventing shortcut learning.

However, the choice of granularity at which DP is applied is oftenneglected. For example, neural machine translation (NMT) typically operates onthe sentence-level granularity. From the perspective of DP, this setup assumesthat each sentence belongs to a single person and any two sentences in thetraining dataset are independent. This assumption is however violated in manyreal-world NMT datasets, e.g. those including dialogues. For proper applicationof DP we thus must shift from sentences to entire documents. In this paper, weinvestigate NMT at both the sentence and document levels, analyzing theprivacy/utility trade-off for both scenarios, and evaluating the risks of notusing the appropriate privacy granularity in terms of leaking personallyidentifiable information (PII). Our findings indicate that the document-levelNMT system is more resistant to membership inference attacks, emphasizing thesignificance of using the appropriate granularity when working with DP.</description><author>Doan Nam Long Vu, Timour Igamberdiev, Ivan Habernal</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 14:52:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18789v1</guid></item><item><title>Coupled Laplacian Eigenmaps for Locally-Aware 3D Rigid Point Cloud Matching</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17372v2</link><description>Point cloud matching, a crucial technique in computer vision, medical androbotics fields, is primarily concerned with finding correspondences betweenpairs of point clouds or voxels. In some practical scenarios, emphasizing localdifferences is crucial for accurately identifying a correct match, therebyenhancing the overall robustness and reliability of the matching process.Commonly used shape descriptors have several limitations and often fail toprovide meaningful local insights about the paired geometries. In this work, wepropose a new technique, based on graph Laplacian eigenmaps, to match pointclouds by taking into account fine local structures. To deal with the order andsign ambiguity of Laplacian eigenmaps, we introduce a new operator, calledCoupled Laplacian (https://github.com/matteo-bastico/CoupLap), that allows toeasily generate aligned eigenspaces for multiple registered geometries. We showthat the similarity between those aligned high-dimensional spaces provides alocally meaningful score to match shapes.

On the other hand, over thepast centuries, the very concept of explanation has been the subject ofextensive philosophical analysis in an attempt to address the fundamentalquestion of "why" in the context of scientific law. However, this discussionhas rarely been connected with XAI. This paper tries to fill in this gap andaims to explore the concept of explanation in AI through an epistemologicallens. By comparing the historical development of both the philosophy of scienceand AI, an intriguing picture emerges. Specifically, we show that a gradualprogression has independently occurred in both domains from logical-deductiveto statistical models of explanation, thereby experiencing in both cases aparadigm shift from deterministic to nondeterministic and probabilisticcausality. Interestingly, we also notice that similar concepts haveindependently emerged in both realms such as, for example, the relation betweenexplanation and understanding and the importance of pragmatic factors. Ourstudy aims to be the first step towards understanding the philosophicalunderpinnings of the notion of explanation in AI, and we hope that our findingswill shed some fresh light on the elusive nature of XAI.</description><author>Martina Mattioli, Antonio Emanuele Cinà, Marcello Pelillo</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 14:44:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18782v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning production functions for supply chains with graph neural networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18772v1</link><description>The global economy relies on the flow of goods over supply chain networks,with nodes as firms and edges as transactions between firms.

In this setting, it can beextremely valuable to infer these production functions, to better understandand improve supply chains, and to forecast future transactions more accurately.However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) cannot capture these hiddenrelationships between nodes' inputs and outputs.

Inaddition, we show that any such analogy can be reduced to an equivalentarithmetic analogy and that any analogical equation has a solution forincreasing numbers, which generalizes without restriction to complex numbers.These foundational results provide a better understanding of analogies in areaswhere representations are numerical.</description><author>Yves Lepage, Miguel Couceiro</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 14:30:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18770v1</guid></item><item><title>TAGIFY: LLM-powered Tagging Interface for Improved Data Findability on OGD portals</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18764v1</link><description>Efforts directed towards promoting Open Government Data (OGD) have gainedsignificant traction across various governmental tiers since the mid-2000s. Asmore datasets are published on OGD portals, finding specific data becomesharder, leading to information overload. Complete and accurate documentation ofdatasets, including association of proper tags with datasets is key toimproving dataset findability and accessibility. Analysis conducted on theEstonian Open Data Portal, revealed that 11% datasets have no associated tags,while 26% had only one tag assigned to them, which underscores challenges indata findability and accessibility within the portal, which, according to therecent Open Data Maturity Report, is considered trend-setter. The aim of thisstudy is to propose an automated solution to tagging datasets to improve datafindability on OGD portals. This paper presents Tagify - a prototype of tagginginterface that employs large language models (LLM) such as GPT-3.5-turbo andGPT-4 to automate dataset tagging, generating tags for datasets in English andEstonian, thereby augmenting metadata preparation by data publishers andimproving data findability on OGD portals by data users. The developed solutionwas evaluated by users and their feedback was collected to define an agenda forfuture prototype improvements.</description><author>Kevin Kliimask, Anastasija Nikiforova</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 14:22:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18764v1</guid></item><item><title>Pseudo-Prompt Generating in Pre-trained Vision-Language Models for Multi-Label Medical Image Classification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06468v2</link><description>The task of medical image recognition is notably complicated by the presenceof varied and multiple pathological indications, presenting a unique challengein multi-label classification with unseen labels. This complexity underlinesthe need for computer-aided diagnosis methods employing multi-label zero-shotlearning. Recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) haveshowcased notable zero-shot classification abilities on medical images.However, these methods have limitations on leveraging extensive pre-trainedknowledge from broader image datasets, and often depend on manual promptconstruction by expert radiologists. By automating the process of prompttuning, prompt learning techniques have emerged as an efficient way to adaptVLMs to downstream tasks. Yet, existing CoOp-based strategies fall short inperforming class-specific prompts on unseen categories, limitinggeneralizability in fine-grained scenarios. To overcome these constraints, weintroduce a novel prompt generation approach inspirited by text generation innatural language processing (NLP). Our method, named Pseudo-Prompt Generating(PsPG), capitalizes on the priori knowledge of multi-modal features. Featuringa RNN-based decoder, PsPG autoregressively generates class-tailored embeddingvectors, i.e., pseudo-prompts. Comparative evaluations on various multi-labelchest radiograph datasets affirm the superiority of our approach againstleading medical vision-language and multi-label prompt learning methods.

It is therefore approached as astochastic problem, where the goal is to minimise the error between the trueand the predicted trajectory. In this work, we explore the application ofmetamorphic testing for human trajectory prediction. Metamorphic testing isdesigned to handle unclear or missing test oracles. It is well-designed forhuman trajectory prediction, where there is no clear criterion of correct orincorrect human behaviour. Metamorphic relations rely on transformations oversource test cases and exploit invariants. A setting well-designed for humantrajectory prediction where there are many symmetries of expected humanbehaviour under variations of the input, e.g. mirroring and rescaling of theinput data.

First,we generalize the existing results of identifiability with the score toadditive noise models with minimal requirements on the causal mechanisms.Second, we establish conditions for inferring causal relations from the scoreeven in the presence of hidden variables; this result is two-faced: wedemonstrate the score's potential as an alternative to conditional independencetests to infer the equivalence class of causal graphs with hidden variables,and we provide the necessary conditions for identifying direct causes in latentvariable models.

It is now well understood that bycontrolling only a small subset of FL clients, it is possible to introduce abackdoor to a federated learning model, in the presence of certain attributes.In this paper, we present a new type of attack that compromises the fairness ofthe trained model. Fairness is understood to be the attribute-level performancedistribution of a trained model. It is particularly salient in domains where,for example, skewed accuracy discrimination between subpopulations could havedisastrous consequences. We find that by employing a threat model similar tothat of a backdoor attack, an attacker is able to influence the aggregatedmodel to have an unfair performance distribution between any given set ofattributes. Furthermore, we find that this attack is possible by controllingonly a single client. While combating naturally induced unfairness in FL haspreviously been discussed in depth, its artificially induced kind has beenneglected. We show that defending against attacks on fairness should be acritical consideration in any situation where unfairness in a trained modelcould benefit a user who participated in its training.</description><author>Joseph Rance, Filip Svoboda</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 14:08:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12715v2</guid></item><item><title>Knowledge Graph Structure as Prompt: Improving Small Language Models Capabilities for Knowledge-based Causal Discovery</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18752v1</link><description>Causal discovery aims to estimate causal structures among variables based onobservational data. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a fresh perspective totackle the causal discovery problem by reasoning on the metadata associatedwith variables rather than their actual data values, an approach referred to asknowledge-based causal discovery. In this paper, we investigate thecapabilities of Small Language Models (SLMs, defined as LLMs with fewer than 1billion parameters) with prompt-based learning for knowledge-based causaldiscovery. Specifically, we present KG Structure as Prompt, a novel approachfor integrating structural information from a knowledge graph, such as commonneighbor nodes and metapaths, into prompt-based learning to enhance thecapabilities of SLMs. Experimental results on three types of biomedical andopen-domain datasets under few-shot settings demonstrate the effectiveness ofour approach, surpassing most baselines and even conventional fine-tuningapproaches trained on full datasets. Our findings further highlight the strongcapabilities of SLMs: in combination with knowledge graphs and prompt-basedlearning, SLMs demonstrate the potential to surpass LLMs with larger number ofparameters.

Most platforms are designed in a limited set ofcountries but deployed in worldwide, without adequate checkpoints. This isespecially problematic for Global South countries which lack strong legislationto safeguard persons facing disparate performance of these systems. Acombination of unavailability of datasets, lack of understanding of FRSfunctionality and low-resource bias mitigation measures accentuate the problem.In this work, we propose a new face dataset composed of 6,579 unique male andfemale sportspersons from eight countries around the world. More than 50% ofthe dataset comprises individuals from the Global South countries and isdemographically diverse. To aid adversarial audits and robust model training,each image has four adversarial variants, totaling over 40,000 images. We alsobenchmark five popular FRSs, both commercial and open-source, for the task ofgender prediction (and country prediction for one of the open-source models asan example of red-teaming). Experiments on industrial FRSs reveal accuraciesranging from 98.2%--38.1%, with a large disparity between males and females inthe Global South (max difference of 38.5%). Biases are also observed in allFRSs between females of the Global North and South (max difference of ~50%).Grad-CAM analysis identifies the nose, forehead and mouth as the regions ofinterest on one of the open-source FRSs. Utilizing this insight, we designsimple, low-resource bias mitigation solutions using few-shot and novelcontrastive learning techniques significantly improving the accuracy withdisparity between males and females reducing from 50% to 1.5% in one of thesettings.

Many of theexisting studies rely on simulated social dilemma environments to study theinteractions of independent learning agents; however, they tend to ignore themoral heterogeneity that is likely to be present in societies of agents inpractice. For example, at different points in time a single learning agent mayface opponents who are consequentialist (i.e., focused on maximizing outcomesover time), norm-based (i.e., conforming to specific norms), or virtue-based(i.e., considering a combination of different virtues). The extent to whichagents' co-development may be impacted by such moral heterogeneity inpopulations is not well understood. In this paper, we present a study of thelearning dynamics of morally heterogeneous populations interacting in a socialdilemma setting. Using an Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma environment with apartner selection mechanism, we investigate the extent to which the prevalenceof diverse moral agents in populations affects individual agents' learningbehaviors and emergent population-level outcomes.

This setup allows us to formulate a novelanomaly score as an ensemble of in-distribution uncertainty and the posteriorof the outlier class which we term negative objectness. Now outliers can beindependently detected due to i) high prediction uncertainty or ii) similaritywith negative data.

Such a responsetypically needs to be estimated from observational data, which introducesseveral challenges. That is why the machine learning (ML) community hasproposed several tailored CADR estimators. Yet, the proposal of most of thesemethods requires strong assumptions on the distribution of data and theassignment of interventions, which go beyond the standard assumptions in causalinference. Whereas previous works have so far focused on smooth shifts incovariate distributions across doses, in this work, we will study estimatingCADR from clustered data and where different doses are assigned to differentsegments of a population. On a novel benchmarking dataset, we show the impactsof clustered data on model performance and propose an estimator, CBRNet, thatlearns cluster-agnostic and hence dose-agnostic covariate representationsthrough representation balancing for unbiased CADR inference. We run extensiveexperiments to illustrate the workings of our method and compare it with thestate of the art in ML for CADR estimation.</description><author>Christopher Bockel-Rickermann, Toon Vanderschueren, Jeroen Berrevoets, Tim Verdonck, Wouter Verbeke</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 13:33:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03731v2</guid></item><item><title>SCB-dataset: A Dataset for Detecting Student Classroom Behavior</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02488v2</link><description>The use of deep learning methods for automatic detection of students'classroom behavior is a promising approach to analyze their class performanceand enhance teaching effectiveness.

Typically, the properties of apolymer, such as plasticity, conductivity, bio-compatibility, and so on, arehighly correlated with its 3D structure. However, existing polymer propertyprediction methods heavily rely on the information learned from polymer SMILESsequences (P-SMILES strings) while ignoring crucial 3D structural information,resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this work, we propose MMPolymer, anovel multimodal multitask pretraining framework incorporating polymer 1Dsequential and 3D structural information to encourage downstream polymerproperty prediction tasks. Besides, considering the scarcity of polymer 3Ddata, we further introduce the "Star Substitution" strategy to extract 3Dstructural information effectively. During pretraining, in addition topredicting masked tokens and recovering clear 3D coordinates, MMPolymerachieves the cross-modal alignment of latent representations. Then we furtherfine-tune the pretrained MMPolymer for downstream polymer property predictiontasks in the supervised learning paradigm. Experiments show that MMPolymerachieves state-of-the-art performance in downstream property prediction tasks.Moreover, given the pretrained MMPolymer, utilizing merely a single modality inthe fine-tuning phase can also outperform existing methods, showcasing theexceptional capability of MMPolymer in polymer feature extraction andutilization.</description><author>Fanmeng Wang, Wentao Guo, Minjie Cheng, Shen Yuan, Hongteng Xu, Zhifeng Gao</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 13:24:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04727v2</guid></item><item><title>LLASP: Fine-tuning Large Language Models for Answer Set Programming</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18723v1</link><description>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their potential invarious natural language processing tasks, including code generation. However,while significant progress has been made in adapting LLMs to generate code forseveral imperative programming languages and tasks, there remains a notable gapin their application to declarative formalisms, such as Answer Set Programming(ASP). In this paper, we move a step towards exploring the capabilities of LLMsfor ASP code generation. First, we perform a systematic evaluation of severalstate-of-the-art LLMs. Despite their power in terms of number of parameters,training data and computational resources, empirical results demonstrateinadequate performances in generating correct ASP programs. Therefore, wepropose LLASP, a fine-tuned lightweight model specifically trained to encodefundamental ASP program patterns. To this aim, we create an ad-hoc datasetcovering a wide variety of fundamental problem specifications that can beencoded in ASP. Our experiments demonstrate that the quality of ASP programsgenerated by LLASP is remarkable. This holds true not only when compared to thenon-fine-tuned counterpart but also when compared to the majority of eager LLMcandidates, particularly from a semantic perspective.

Existing works on creatinganimatible avatars either do not focus on relighting at all, require controlledillumination setups, or try to recover a relightable avatar from very low costsetups, i.e. a single RGB video, at the cost of severely limited resultquality, e.g. shadows not even being modeled. To address this, we proposeRelightable Neural Actor, a new video-based method for learning a pose-drivenneural human model that can be relighted, allows appearance editing, and modelspose-dependent effects such as wrinkles and self-shadows. Importantly, fortraining, our method solely requires a multi-view recording of the human undera known, but static lighting condition. To tackle this challenging problem, weleverage an implicit geometry representation of the actor with a drivabledensity field that models pose-dependent deformations and derive a dynamicmapping between 3D and UV spaces, where normal, visibility, and materials areeffectively encoded. To evaluate our approach in real-world scenarios, wecollect a new dataset with four identities recorded under different lightconditions, indoors and outdoors, providing the first benchmark of its kind forhuman relighting, and demonstrating state-of-the-art relighting results fornovel human poses.</description><author>Diogo Luvizon, Vladislav Golyanik, Adam Kortylewski, Marc Habermann, Christian Theobalt</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 13:16:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11587v2</guid></item><item><title>Neurosymbolic AI for Enhancing Instructability in Generative AI</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18722v1</link><description>Generative AI, especially via Large Language Models (LLMs), has transformedcontent creation across text, images, and music, showcasing capabilities infollowing instructions through prompting, largely facilitated by instructiontuning.

However, the existingtransformer-based approaches heavily rely on the naive attention mechanism forcapturing the spatiotemporal features, which falls short in learningdiscriminative representations that exhibit similar motion patterns. To addressthis challenge, we introduce the Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer(FreqMixFormer), specifically designed for recognizing similar skeletal actionswith subtle discriminative motions. First, we introduce a frequency-awareattention module to unweave skeleton frequency representations by embeddingjoint features into frequency attention maps, aiming to distinguish thediscriminative movements based on their frequency coefficients. Subsequently,we develop a mixed transformer architecture to incorporate spatial featureswith frequency features to model the comprehensive frequency-spatial patterns.Additionally, a temporal transformer is proposed to extract the globalcorrelations across frames.

Previous approaches improve prediction efficiency bylearning in an end-to-end manner. However, these methods exhibit limitedperformance as they assume unidirectional conditioning between entities andpredicates, leading to insufficient information interaction. To address thislimitation, we propose a novel bidirectional conditioning factorization forSGG, introducing efficient interaction between entities and predicates.Specifically, we develop an end-to-end scene graph generation model,Bidirectional Conditioning Transformer (BCTR), to implement our factorization.BCTR consists of two key modules. First, the Bidirectional ConditioningGenerator (BCG) facilitates multi-stage interactive feature augmentationbetween entities and predicates, enabling mutual benefits between the twopredictions. Second, Random Feature Alignment (RFA) regularizes the featurespace by distilling multi-modal knowledge from pre-trained models, enhancingBCTR's ability on tailed categories without relying on statistical priors. Weconduct a series of experiments on Visual Genome and Open Image V6,demonstrating that BCTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on bothbenchmarks.

This is motivated byapplications such as crowdsourcing, and online advertising, where immediatefeedback is not immediately available and fairness among different choices (orarms) is crucial. We consider two types of unrestricted feedback delays:reward-independent delays where the feedback delays are independent of therewards, and reward-dependent delays where the feedback delays are correlatedwith the rewards. Furthermore, we introduce merit-based fairness constraints toensure a fair selection of the arms. We define the reward regret and thefairness regret and present new bandit algorithms to select arms underunrestricted feedback delays based on their merits. We prove that ouralgorithms all achieve sublinear expected reward regret and expected fairnessregret, with a dependence on the quantiles of the delay distribution. We alsoconduct extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world data and show thatour algorithms can fairly select arms with different feedback delays.</description><author>Ziqun Chen, Kechao Cai, Zhuoyue Chen, Jinbei Zhang, John C.

We investigate how vocabulary size impacts LLM scaling laws by trainingmodels ranging from 33M to 3B parameters on up to 500B characters with variousvocabulary configurations. We propose three complementary approaches forpredicting the compute-optimal vocabulary size: IsoFLOPs analysis, derivativeestimation, and parametric fit of the loss function. Our approaches converge onthe same result that the optimal vocabulary size depends on the availablecompute budget and that larger models deserve larger vocabularies. However,most LLMs use too small vocabulary sizes. For example, we predict that theoptimal vocabulary size of Llama2-70B should have been at least 216K, 7 timeslarger than its vocabulary of 32K. We validate our predictions empirically bytraining models with 3B parameters across different FLOPs budgets. Adopting ourpredicted optimal vocabulary size consistently improves downstream performanceover commonly used vocabulary sizes. By increasing the vocabulary size from theconventional 32K to 43K, we improve performance on ARC-Challenge from 29.1 to32.0 with the same 2.3e21 FLOPs.

To extract encoded knowledge without (potentially) biased humanlabels, unsupervised probing techniques like Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS)have been developed (Burns et al., 2022). However, salient but unrelatedfeatures in a given dataset can mislead these probes (Farquhar et al., 2023).Addressing this, we propose a cluster normalization method to minimize theimpact of such features by clustering and normalizing activations of contrastpairs before applying unsupervised probing techniques. While this approach doesnot address the issue of differentiating between knowledge in general andsimulated knowledge - a major issue in the literature of latent knowledgeelicitation (Christiano et al., 2021) - it significantly improves the abilityof unsupervised probes to identify the intended knowledge amidst distractions.</description><author>Walter Laurito, Sharan Maiya, Grégoire Dhimoïla, Owen, Yeung, Kaarel Hänni</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 12:57:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18712v1</guid></item><item><title>AEP$n$P: A Less-constrained EP$n$P Solver for Pose Estimation with Anisotropic Scaling</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09982v4</link><description>Perspective-$n$-Point (P$n$P) stands as a fundamental algorithm for poseestimation in various applications.

However, these models,trained on curated datasets, inherently embody biases ranging from racial tonational and gender biases. It remains uncertain whether these biases impactthe performance of LLMs for certain tasks. In this study, we investigate thepolitical biases of LLMs within the stance classification task, specificallyexamining whether these models exhibit a tendency to more accurately classifypolitically-charged stances. Utilizing three datasets, seven LLMs, and fourdistinct prompting schemes, we analyze the performance of LLMs on politicallyoriented statements and targets. Our findings reveal a statisticallysignificant difference in the performance of LLMs across various politicallyoriented stance classification tasks. Furthermore, we observe that thisdifference primarily manifests at the dataset level, with models and promptingschemes showing statistically similar performances across different stanceclassification datasets. Lastly, we observe that when there is greaterambiguity in the target the statement is directed towards, LLMs have poorerstance classification accuracy.

Because of the favorable properties of Gaussian processes,this equivalence is commonly employed to analyze neural networks and has led tovarious breakthroughs over the years. However, neural networks and Gaussianprocesses are equivalent only in the limit; in the finite case there arecurrently no methods available to approximate a trained neural network with aGaussian model with bounds on the approximation error. In this work, we presentan algorithmic framework to approximate a neural network of finite width anddepth, and with not necessarily i.i.d. parameters, with a mixture of Gaussianprocesses with error bounds on the approximation error. In particular, weconsider the Wasserstein distance to quantify the closeness betweenprobabilistic models and, by relying on tools from optimal transport andGaussian processes, we iteratively approximate the output distribution of eachlayer of the neural network as a mixture of Gaussian processes. Crucially, forany NN and $\epsilon &gt;0$ our approach is able to return a mixture of Gaussianprocesses that is $\epsilon$-close to the NN at a finite set of input points.Furthermore, we rely on the differentiability of the resulting error bound toshow how our approach can be employed to tune the parameters of a NN to mimicthe functional behavior of a given Gaussian process, e.g., for prior selectionin the context of Bayesian inference. We empirically investigate theeffectiveness of our results on both regression and classification problemswith various neural network architectures. Our experiments highlight how ourresults can represent an important step towards understanding neural networkpredictions and formally quantifying their uncertainty.</description><author>Steven Adams, Patanè, Morteza Lahijanian, Luca Laurenti</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 12:45:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18707v1</guid></item></channel></rss>
