Extending such capabilities to the remote sensing domain remains challenging, as models must reason over spatial scale, geographic structures, and multispectral indices while maintaining coherent multi-step logic. To bridge this gap, OpenEarthAgent introduces a unified framework for developing tool-augmented geospatial agents trained on satellite imagery, natural-language queries, and detailed reasoning traces. The training pipeline relies on supervised fine-tuning over structured reasoning trajectories, aligning the model with verified multistep tool interactions across diverse analytical contexts. The accompanying corpus comprises 14,538 training and 1,169 evaluation instances, with more than 100K reasoning steps in the training split and over 7K reasoning steps in the evaluation split. It spans urban, environmental, disaster, and infrastructure domains, and incorporates GIS-based operations alongside index analyses such as NDVI, NBR, and NDBI. Grounded in explicit reasoning traces, the learned agent demonstrates structured reasoning, stable spatial understanding, and interpretable behaviour through tool-driven geospatial interactions across diverse conditions. We report consistent improvements over a strong baseline and competitive performance relative to recent open and closed-source models.</description><author>Akashah Shabbir, Muhammad Umer Sheikh, Muhammad Akhtar Munir, Hiyam Debary, Mustansar Fiaz, Muhammad Zaigham Zaheer, Paolo Fraccaro, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Muhammad Haris Khan, Xiao Xiang Zhu, Salman Khan</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:59:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17665v1</guid></item><item><title>Sink-Aware Pruning for Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17664v1</link><description>Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) incur high inference cost due to iterative denoising, motivating efficient pruning. Existing pruning heuristics largely inherited from autoregressive (AR) LLMs, typically preserve attention sink tokens because AR sinks serve as stable global anchors. We show that this assumption does not hold for DLMs: the attention-sink position exhibits substantially higher variance over the full generation trajectory (measured by how the dominant sink locations shift across timesteps), indicating that sinks are often transient and less structurally essential than in AR models. Based on this observation, we propose ${\bf \texttt{Sink-Aware Pruning}}$, which automatically identifies and prunes unstable sinks in DLMs (prior studies usually keep sinks for AR LLMs). Without retraining, our method achieves a better quality-efficiency trade-off and outperforms strong prior pruning baselines under matched compute.

Building on the HIPE-2020 and HIPE-2022 campaigns, it extends the series toward semantic relation extraction by targeting the task of identifying person--place associations in multiple languages and time periods. Systems are asked to classify relations of two types - $at$ ("Has the person ever been at this place?") and $isAt$ ("Is the person located at this place around publication time?") - requiring reasoning over temporal and geographical cues. The lab introduces a three-fold evaluation profile that jointly assesses accuracy, computational efficiency, and domain generalization. By linking relation extraction to large-scale historical data processing, HIPE-2026 aims to support downstream applications in knowledge-graph construction, historical biography reconstruction, and spatial analysis in digital humanities.</description><author>Juri Opitz, Corina Raclé, Emanuela Boros, Andrianos Michail, Matteo Romanello, Maud Ehrmann, Simon Clematide</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:59:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17663v1</guid></item><item><title>When Vision Overrides Language: Evaluating and Mitigating Counterfactual Failures in VLAs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17659v1</link><description>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) promise to ground language instructions in robot control, yet in practice often fail to faithfully follow language. When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $π_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model. In real-world evaluations, CAG reduces counterfactual failures of 9.4% and improves task success by 17.2% on average.</description><author>Yu Fang, Yuchun Feng, Dong Jing, Jiaqi Liu, Yue Yang, Zhenyu Wei, Daniel Szafir, Mingyu Ding</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:59:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17659v1</guid></item><item><title>MARS: Margin-Aware Reward-Modeling with Self-Refinement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17658v1</link><description>Reward modeling is a core component of modern alignment pipelines including RLHF and RLAIF, underpinning policy optimization methods including PPO and TRPO. However, training reliable reward models relies heavily on human-labeled preference data, which is costly and limited, motivating the use of data augmentation. Existing augmentation approaches typically operate at the representation or semantic level and remain agnostic to the reward model's estimation difficulty. In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that this strategy increases the average curvature of the loss function hence enhance information and improves conditioning, along with empirical results demonstrating consistent gains over uniform augmentation for robust reward modeling.</description><author>Payel Bhattacharjee, Osvaldo Simeone, Ravi Tandon</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:59:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17658v1</guid></item><item><title>What Language is This? Ask Your Tokenizer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17655v1</link><description>Language Identification (LID) is an important component of many multilingual natural language processing pipelines, where it facilitates corpus curation, training data analysis, and cross-lingual evaluation of large language models. Despite near-perfect performance on high-resource languages, existing systems remain brittle in low-resource and closely related language settings. We introduce UniLID, a simple and efficient LID method based on the UnigramLM tokenization algorithm, leveraging its probabilistic framing, parameter estimation technique and inference strategy. In short, we learn language-conditional unigram distributions over a shared tokenizer vocabulary but treat segmentation as a language-specific phenomenon. Our formulation is data- and compute-efficient, supports incremental addition of new languages without retraining existing models, and can naturally be integrated into existing language model tokenization pipelines. Empirical evaluations against widely used baselines, including fastText, GlotLID, and CLD3, show that UniLID achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, substantially improves sample efficiency in low-resource settings - surpassing 70% accuracy with as few as five labeled samples per language - and delivers large gains on fine-grained dialect identification.</description><author>Clara Meister, Ahmetcan Yavuz, Pietro Lesci, Tiago Pimentel</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:58:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17655v1</guid></item><item><title>Mine and Refine: Optimizing Graded Relevance in E-commerce Search Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17654v1</link><description>We propose a two-stage "Mine and Refine" contrastive training framework for semantic text embeddings to enhance multi-category e-commerce search retrieval. Large scale e-commerce search demands embeddings that generalize to long tail, noisy queries while adhering to scalable supervision compatible with product and policy constraints. A practical challenge is that relevance is often graded: users accept substitutes or complements beyond exact matches, and production systems benefit from clear separation of similarity scores across these relevance strata for stable hybrid blending and thresholding. To obtain scalable policy consistent supervision, we fine-tune a lightweight LLM on human annotations under a three-level relevance guideline and further reduce residual noise via engagement driven auditing. In Stage 1, we train a multilingual Siamese two-tower retriever with a label aware supervised contrastive objective that shapes a robust global semantic space. In Stage 2, we mine hard samples via ANN and re-annotate them with the policy aligned LLM, and introduce a multi-class extension of circle loss that explicitly sharpens similarity boundaries between relevance levels, to further refine and enrich the embedding space. Robustness is additionally improved through additive spelling augmentation and synthetic query generation. Extensive offline evaluations and production A/B tests show that our framework improves retrieval relevance and delivers statistically significant gains in engagement and business impact.</description><author>Jiaqi Xi, Raghav Saboo, Luming Chen, Martin Wang, Sudeep Das</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:56:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17654v1</guid></item><item><title>Differences in Typological Alignment in Language Models' Treatment of Differential Argument Marking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17653v1</link><description>Recent work has shown that language models (LMs) trained on synthetic corpora can exhibit typological preferences that resemble cross-linguistic regularities in human languages, particularly for syntactic phenomena such as word order. In this paper, we extend this paradigm to differential argument marking (DAM), a semantic licensing system in which morphological marking depends on semantic prominence. Using a controlled synthetic learning method, we train GPT-2 models on 18 corpora implementing distinct DAM systems and evaluate their generalization using minimal pairs. Our results reveal a dissociation between two typological dimensions of DAM. Models reliably exhibit human-like preferences for natural markedness direction, favoring systems in which overt marking targets semantically atypical arguments. In contrast, models do not reproduce the strong object preference in human languages, in which overt marking in DAM more often targets objects rather than subjects. These findings suggest that different typological tendencies may arise from distinct underlying sources.</description><author>Iskar Deng, Nathalia Xu, Shane Steinert-Threlkeld</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:56:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17653v1</guid></item><item><title>Human-level 3D shape perception emerges from multi-view learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17650v1</link><description>Humans can infer the three-dimensional structure of objects from two-dimensional visual inputs. Modeling this ability has been a longstanding goal for the science and engineering of visual intelligence, yet decades of computational methods have fallen short of human performance. Here we develop a modeling framework that predicts human 3D shape inferences for arbitrary objects, directly from experimental stimuli. We achieve this with a novel class of neural networks trained using a visual-spatial objective over naturalistic sensory data; given a set of images taken from different locations within a natural scene, these models learn to predict spatial information related to these images, such as camera location and visual depth, without relying on any object-related inductive biases. Notably, these visual-spatial signals are analogous to sensory cues readily available to humans. We design a zero-shot evaluation approach to determine the performance of these `multi-view' models on a well established 3D perception task, then compare model and human behavior. Our modeling framework is the first to match human accuracy on 3D shape inferences, even without task-specific training or fine-tuning. Remarkably, independent readouts of model responses predict fine-grained measures of human behavior, including error patterns and reaction times, revealing a natural correspondence between model dynamics and human perception. Taken together, our findings indicate that human-level 3D perception can emerge from a simple, scalable learning objective over naturalistic visual-spatial data. All code, human behavioral data, and experimental stimuli needed to reproduce our findings can be found on our project page.</description><author>Tyler Bonnen, Jitendra Malik, Angjoo Kanazawa</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:56:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17650v1</guid></item><item><title>Multi-Round Human-AI Collaboration with User-Specified Requirements</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17646v1</link><description>As humans increasingly rely on multiround conversational AI for high stakes decisions, principled frameworks are needed to ensure such interactions reliably improve decision quality. We adopt a human centric view governed by two principles: counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not undermine human strengths, and complementarity, ensuring it adds value where the human is prone to err. We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics. We evaluate our framework across two interactive settings: LLM simulated collaboration on a medical diagnostic task and a human crowdsourcing study on a pictorial reasoning task. We show that our online procedure maintains prescribed counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates even under nonstationary interaction dynamics. Moreover, tightening or loosening these constraints produces predictable shifts in downstream human accuracy, confirming that the two principles serve as practical levers for steering multi-round collaboration toward better decision quality without the need to model or constrain human behavior.</description><author>Sima Noorani, Shayan Kiyani, Hamed Hassani, George Pappas</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:54:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17646v1</guid></item><item><title>Pushing the Frontier of Black-Box LVLM Attacks via Fine-Grained Detail Targeting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17645v1</link><description>Black-box adversarial attacks on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are challenging due to missing gradients and complex multimodal boundaries. While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

We present A.R.I.S. (Automated Recycling Identification System), a low-cost, portable sorter for shredded e-waste that addresses this efficiency gap. The system employs a YOLOx model to classify metals, plastics, and circuit boards in real time, achieving low inference latency with high detection accuracy. Experimental evaluation yielded 90% overall precision, 82.2% mean average precision (mAP), and 84% sortation purity. By integrating deep learning with established sorting methods, A.R.I.S. enhances material recovery efficiency and lowers barriers to advanced recycling adoption. This work complements broader initiatives in extending product life cycles, supporting trade-in and recycling programs, and reducing environmental impact across the supply chain.</description><author>Dhruv Talwar, Harsh Desai, Wendong Yin, Goutam Mohanty, Rafael Reveles</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:54:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17642v1</guid></item><item><title>FAMOSE: A ReAct Approach to Automated Feature Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17641v1</link><description>Feature engineering remains a critical yet challenging bottleneck in machine learning, particularly for tabular data, as identifying optimal features from an exponentially large feature space traditionally demands substantial domain expertise. To address this challenge, we introduce FAMOSE (Feature AugMentation and Optimal Selection agEnt), a novel framework that leverages the ReAct paradigm to autonomously explore, generate, and refine features while integrating feature selection and evaluation tools within an agent architecture. To our knowledge, FAMOSE represents the first application of an agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering, especially for both regression and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAMOSE is at or near the state-of-the-art on classification tasks (especially tasks with more than 10K instances, where ROC-AUC increases 0.23% on average), and achieves the state-of-the-art for regression tasks by reducing RMSE by 2.0% on average, while remaining more robust to errors than other algorithms. We hypothesize that FAMOSE's strong performance is because ReAct allows the LLM context window to record (via iterative feature discovery and evaluation steps) what features did or did not work. This is similar to a few-shot prompt and guides the LLM to invent better, more innovative features. Our work offers evidence that AI agents are remarkably effective in solving problems that require highly inventive solutions, such as feature engineering.</description><author>Keith Burghardt, Jienan Liu, Sadman Sakib, Yuning Hao, Bo Li</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:53:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17641v1</guid></item><item><title>IntRec: Intent-based Retrieval with Contrastive Refinement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17639v1</link><description>Retrieving user-specified objects from complex scenes remains a challenging task, especially when queries are ambiguous or involve multiple similar objects. Existing open-vocabulary detectors operate in a one-shot manner, lacking the ability to refine predictions based on user feedback. To address this, we propose IntRec, an interactive object retrieval framework that refines predictions based on user feedback. At its core is an Intent State (IS) that maintains dual memory sets for positive anchors (confirmed cues) and negative constraints (rejected hypotheses). A contrastive alignment function ranks candidate objects by maximizing similarity to positive cues while penalizing rejected ones, enabling fine-grained disambiguation in cluttered scenes. Our interactive framework provides substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy without additional supervision. On LVIS, IntRec achieves 35.4 AP, outperforming OVMR, CoDet, and CAKE by +2.3, +3.7, and +0.5, respectively. On the challenging LVIS-Ambiguous benchmark, it improves performance by +7.9 AP over its one-shot baseline after a single corrective feedback, with less than 30 ms of added latency per interaction.</description><author>Pourya Shamsolmoali, Masoumeh Zareapoor, Eric Granger, Yue Lu</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:50:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17639v1</guid></item><item><title>CORAL: Correspondence Alignment for Improved Virtual Try-On</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17636v1</link><description>Existing methods for Virtual Try-On (VTON) often struggle to preserve fine garment details, especially in unpaired settings where accurate person-garment correspondence is required. These methods do not explicitly enforce person-garment alignment and fail to explain how correspondence emerges within Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). In this paper, we first analyze full 3D attention in DiT-based architecture and reveal that the person-garment correspondence critically depends on precise person-garment query-key matching within the full 3D attention. Building on this insight, we then introduce CORrespondence ALignment (CORAL), a DiT-based framework that explicitly aligns query-key matching with robust external correspondences. CORAL integrates two complementary components: a correspondence distillation loss that aligns reliable matches with person-garment attention, and an entropy minimization loss that sharpens the attention distribution. We further propose a VLM-based evaluation protocol to better reflect human preference. CORAL consistently improves over the baseline, enhancing both global shape transfer and local detail preservation. Extensive ablations validate our design choices.</description><author>Jiyoung Kim, Youngjin Shin, Siyoon Jin, Dahyun Chung, Jisu Nam, Tongmin Kim, Jongjae Park, Hyeonwoo Kang, Seungryong Kim</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:50:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17636v1</guid></item><item><title>Reverso: Efficient Time Series Foundation Models for Zero-shot Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17634v1</link><description>Learning time series foundation models has been shown to be a promising approach for zero-shot time series forecasting across diverse time series domains. Insofar as scaling has been a critical driver of performance of foundation models in other modalities such as language and vision, much recent work on time series foundation modeling has focused on scaling. This has resulted in time series foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters that are, while performant, inefficient and expensive to use in practice. This paper describes a simple recipe for learning efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting that are orders of magnitude smaller. We show that large-scale transformers are not necessary: small hybrid models that interleave long convolution and linear RNN layers (in particular DeltaNet layers) can match the performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than a hundred times smaller. We also describe several data augmentation and inference strategies that further improve performance. This recipe results in Reverso, a family of efficient time series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting that significantly push the performance-efficiency Pareto frontier.</description><author>Xinghong Fu, Yanhong Li, Georgios Papaioannou, Yoon Kim</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:48:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17634v1</guid></item><item><title>When to Trust the Cheap Check: Weak and Strong Verification for Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17633v1</link><description>Reasoning with LLMs increasingly unfolds inside a broader verification loop. Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification. Externally, users inspect outputs and steer the model through feedback until results are trustworthy, which we call strong verification. These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers. Building on this, we develop an online algorithm that provably controls acceptance and rejection errors without assumptions on the query stream, the language model, or the weak verifier.</description><author>Shayan Kiyani, Sima Noorani, George Pappas, Hamed Hassani</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:47:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17633v1</guid></item><item><title>SMAC: Score-Matched Actor-Critics for Robust Offline-to-Online Transfer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17632v1</link><description>Modern offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods find performant actor-critics, however, fine-tuning these actor-critics online with value-based RL algorithms typically causes immediate drops in performance. We provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that, in the loss landscape, offline maxima for prior algorithms and online maxima are separated by low-performance valleys that gradient-based fine-tuning traverses. Following this, we present Score Matched Actor-Critic (SMAC), an offline RL method designed to learn actor-critics that transition to online value-based RL algorithms with no drop in performance. SMAC avoids valleys between offline and online maxima by regularizing the Q-function during the offline phase to respect a first-order derivative equality between the score of the policy and action-gradient of the Q-function. We experimentally demonstrate that SMAC converges to offline maxima that are connected to better online maxima via paths with monotonically increasing reward found by first-order optimization. SMAC achieves smooth transfer to Soft Actor-Critic and TD3 in 6/6 D4RL tasks. In 4/6 environments, it reduces regret by 34-58% over the best baseline.</description><author>Nathan S. de Lara, Florian Shkurti</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:47:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17632v1</guid></item><item><title>Catastrophic Forgetting Resilient One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17625v1</link><description>Modern big-data systems generate massive, heterogeneous, and geographically dispersed streams that are large-scale and privacy-sensitive, making centralization challenging. While federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-enhancing training mechanism, it assumes a static data flow and learns a collaborative model over multiple rounds, making learning with \textit{incremental} data challenging in limited-communication scenarios. This paper presents One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning (OSI-FL), the first FL framework that addresses the dual challenges of communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting. OSI-FL communicates category-specific embeddings, devised by a frozen vision-language model (VLM) from each client in a single communication round, which a pre-trained diffusion model at the server uses to synthesize new data similar to the client's data distribution. The synthesized samples are used on the server for training. However, two challenges still persist: i) tasks arriving incrementally need to retrain the global model, and ii) as future tasks arrive, retraining the model introduces catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we augment training with Selective Sample Retention (SSR), which identifies and retains the top-p most informative samples per category and task pair based on sample loss. SSR bounds forgetting by ensuring that representative retained samples are incorporated into training in further iterations. The experimental results indicate that OSI-FL outperforms baselines, including traditional and one-shot FL approaches, in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios across three benchmark datasets.</description><author>Obaidullah Zaland, Zulfiqar Ahmad Khan, Monowar Bhuyan</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:44:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17625v1</guid></item><item><title>Unmasking the Factual-Conceptual Gap in Persian Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17623v1</link><description>While emerging Persian NLP benchmarks have expanded into pragmatics and politeness, they rarely distinguish between memorized cultural facts and the ability to reason about implicit social norms. We introduce DivanBench, a diagnostic benchmark focused on superstitions and customs, arbitrary, context-dependent rules that resist simple logical deduction. Through 315 questions across three task types (factual retrieval, paired scenario verification, and situational reasoning), we evaluate seven Persian LLMs and reveal three critical failures: most models exhibit severe acquiescence bias, correctly identifying appropriate behaviors but failing to reject clear violations; continuous Persian pretraining amplifies this bias rather than improving reasoning, often degrading the model's ability to discern contradictions; and all models show a 21\% performance gap between retrieving factual knowledge and applying it in scenarios. These findings demonstrate that cultural competence requires more than scaling monolingual data, as current models learn to mimic cultural patterns without internalizing the underlying schemas.</description><author>Alireza Sakhaeirad, Ali Ma'manpoosh, Arshia Hemmat</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:42:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17623v1</guid></item><item><title>Stable Asynchrony: Variance-Controlled Off-Policy RL for LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17616v1</link><description>Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to improve large language models on reasoning tasks, and asynchronous RL training is attractive because it increases end-to-end throughput. However, for widely adopted critic-free policy-gradient methods such as REINFORCE and GRPO, high asynchrony makes the policy-gradient estimator markedly $\textbf{higher variance}$: training on stale rollouts creates heavy-tailed importance ratios, causing a small fraction of samples to dominate updates. This amplification makes gradients noisy and learning unstable relative to matched on-policy training. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, we find collapse is reliably predicted by effective sample size (ESS) and unstable gradient norms. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose $\textbf{V}$ariance $\textbf{C}$ontrolled $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{VCPO}$), a general stabilization method for REINFORCE/GRPO-style algorithms that (i) scales learning rate based on effective sample size to dampen unreliable updates, and (ii) applies a closed-form minimum-variance baseline for the off-policy setting, avoiding an auxiliary value model and adding minimal overhead. Empirically, VCPO substantially improves robustness for asynchronous training across math, general reasoning, and tool-use tasks, outperforming a broad suite of baselines spanning masking/clipping stabilizers and algorithmic variants. This reduces long-context, multi-turn training time by 2.5$\times$ while matching synchronous performance, demonstrating that explicit control of policy-gradient variance is key for reliable asynchronous RL at scale.</description><author>Luke Huang, Zhuoyang Zhang, Qinghao Hu, Shang Yang, Song Han</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:40:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17616v1</guid></item><item><title>Guarding the Middle: Protecting Intermediate Representations in Federated Split Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17614v1</link><description>Big data scenarios, where massive, heterogeneous datasets are distributed across clients, demand scalable, privacy-preserving learning methods. Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning (ML) models across clients without data centralization. Decentralized training, however, introduces a computational burden on client devices. U-shaped federated split learning (UFSL) offloads a fraction of the client computation to the server while keeping both data and labels on the clients' side. However, the intermediate representations (i.e., smashed data) shared by clients with the server are prone to exposing clients' private data. To reduce exposure of client data through intermediate data representations, this work proposes k-anonymous differentially private UFSL (KD-UFSL), which leverages privacy-enhancing techniques such as microaggregation and differential privacy to minimize data leakage from the smashed data transferred to the server. We first demonstrate that an adversary can access private client data from intermediate representations via a data-reconstruction attack, and then present a privacy-enhancing solution, KD-UFSL, to mitigate this risk. Our experiments indicate that, alongside increasing the mean squared error between the actual and reconstructed images by up to 50% in some cases, KD-UFSL also decreases the structural similarity between them by up to 40% on four benchmarking datasets. More importantly, KD-UFSL improves privacy while preserving the utility of the global model. This highlights its suitability for large-scale big data applications where privacy and utility must be balanced.</description><author>Obaidullah Zaland, Sajib Mistry, Monowar Bhuyan</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:40:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17614v1</guid></item><item><title>Contrastive Diffusion Alignment: Learning Structured Latents for Controllable Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14190v2</link><description>Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are high dimensional and not explicitly organized for interpretation or control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive Diffusion Alignment), a plug-and-play geometry layer that applies contrastive learning to pretrained diffusion latents using auxiliary variables (e.g., time, stimulation parameters, facial action units). ConDA learns a low-dimensional embedding whose directions align with underlying dynamical factors, consistent with recent contrastive learning results on structured and disentangled representations. In this embedding, simple nonlinear trajectories support smooth interpolation, extrapolation, and counterfactual editing while rendering remains in the original diffusion space. ConDA separates editing and rendering by lifting embedding trajectories back to diffusion latents with a neighborhood-preserving kNN decoder and is robust across inversion solvers. Across fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging, therapeutic neurostimulation, facial expression dynamics, and monkey motor cortex activity, ConDA yields more interpretable and controllable latent structure than linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines, indicating that diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure that can be exploited by an explicit contrastive geometry layer.</description><author>Ruchi Sandilya, Sumaira Perez, Charles Lynch, Lindsay Victoria, Benjamin Zebley, Derrick Matthew Buchanan, Mahendra T.

The estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters. Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe achieves up to 25\% pruning while retaining approximately 90\% of the original model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps, resulting in minimal computational overhead.

While statistical watermarking has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: the lack of a principled approach for selecting sampling distributions and the reliance on fixed-horizon hypothesis testing, which precludes valid early stopping. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process. By leveraging an anchor distribution to approximate the target model, we characterize the optimal e-value with respect to the worst-case log-growth rate and derive the optimal expected stopping time. Our theoretical claims are substantiated by simulations and evaluations on established benchmarks, showing that our framework can significantly enhance sample efficiency, reducing the average token budget required for detection by 13-15% relative to state-of-the-art baselines.</description><author>Baihe Huang, Eric Xu, Kannan Ramchandran, Jiantao Jiao, Michael I.

To address this, we propose a unified geospatial discovery framework that integrates active learning, online meta-learning, and concept-guided reasoning. Our approach introduces two key innovations built on a shared notion of *concept relevance*, which captures how domain-specific factors influence target presence: a *concept-weighted uncertainty sampling strategy*, where uncertainty is modulated by learned relevance based on readily-available domain-specific concepts (e.g., land cover, source proximity); and a *relevance-aware meta-batch formation strategy* that promotes semantic diversity during online-meta updates, improving generalization in dynamic environments.

This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we propose policy-based flow models ($π$-Flow). $π$-Flow modifies the output layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep. The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply mimicking the teacher's behavior, $π$-Flow enables stable and scalable training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming previous 1-NFE models of the same DiT architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $π$-Flow achieves substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art DMD models, while maintaining teacher-level quality.</description><author>Hansheng Chen, Kai Zhang, Hao Tan, Leonidas Guibas, Gordon Wetzstein, Sai Bi</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:30:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14974v3</guid></item><item><title>SOLVAR: Fast covariance-based heterogeneity analysis with pose refinement for cryo-EM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17603v1</link><description>Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a powerful technique for resolving the three-dimensional structures of macromolecules. A key challenge in cryo-EM is characterizing continuous heterogeneity, where molecules adopt a continuum of conformational states. Covariance-based methods offer a principled approach to modeling structural variability. However, estimating the covariance matrix efficiently remains a challenging computational task. In this paper, we present SOLVAR (Stochastic Optimization for Low-rank Variability Analysis), which leverages a low-rank assumption on the covariance matrix to provide a tractable estimator for its principal components, despite the apparently prohibitive large size of the covariance matrix. Under this low-rank assumption, our estimator can be formulated as an optimization problem that can be solved quickly and accurately. Moreover, our framework enables refinement of the poses of the input particle images, a capability absent from most heterogeneity-analysis methods, and all covariance-based methods. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and experimental datasets demonstrate that the algorithm accurately captures dominant components of variability while maintaining computational efficiency. SOLVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets in a recent heterogeneity benchmark.

Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

In this work, we introduce MolHIT, a powerful molecular graph generation framework that overcomes long-standing performance limitations in existing methods. MolHIT is based on the Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Model, which generalizes discrete diffusion to additional categories that encode chemical priors, and decoupled atom encoding that splits the atom types according to their chemical roles. Overall, MolHIT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the MOSES dataset with near-perfect validity for the first time in graph diffusion, surpassing strong 1D baselines across multiple metrics.

However, existing image-conditioned systems suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they are typically trained on natural photographs, limiting their ability to capture the richer semantic, stylistic, and cultural content of artworks; and (ii) most rely on an image-to-text conversion stage, using language as a semantic shortcut that simplifies conditioning but prevents direct visual-to-audio learning. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce ArtSound, a large-scale multimodal dataset of 105,884 artwork-music pairs enriched with dual-modality captions, obtained by extending ArtGraph and the Free Music Archive. We further propose ArtToMus, the first framework explicitly designed for direct artwork-to-music generation, which maps digitized artworks to music without image-to-text translation or language-based semantic supervision. The framework projects visual embeddings into the conditioning space of a latent diffusion model, enabling music synthesis guided solely by visual information. Experimental results show that ArtToMus generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs that reflect salient visual cues of the source artworks. While absolute alignment scores remain lower than those of text-conditioned systems-as expected given the substantially increased difficulty of removing linguistic supervision-ArtToMus achieves competitive perceptual quality and meaningful cross-modal correspondence. This work establishes direct visual-to-music generation as a distinct and challenging research direction, and provides resources that support applications in multimedia art, cultural heritage, and AI-assisted creative practice.

Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a "human game" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the "Multiverse of Human Games". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.</description><author>Lance Ying, Ryan Truong, Prafull Sharma, Kaiya Ivy Zhao, Nathan Cloos, Kelsey R.

Although recent decoupling-based distillation methods enable dataset distillation at large scale, they continue to face an efficiency gap: optimization-based decoupling methods achieve higher accuracy but demand intensive computation, whereas optimization-free decoupling methods are efficient but sacrifice accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, we propose Exploration--Exploitation Distillation (E$^2$D), a simple, practical method that minimizes redundant computation through an efficient pipeline that begins with full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity and feature diversity. It then uses a two-phase optimization strategy: an exploration phase that performs uniform updates and identifies high-loss regions, and an exploitation phase that focuses updates on these regions to accelerate convergence. We evaluate E$^2$D on large-scale benchmarks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K while being $18\times$ faster, and on ImageNet-21K, our method substantially improves accuracy while remaining $4.3\times$ faster. These results demonstrate that targeted, redundancy-reducing updates, rather than brute-force optimization, bridge the gap between accuracy and efficiency in large-scale dataset distillation.

The artificial perturbations commonly used in GCL, such as node dropping, induce structural changes that can diverge from biological reality. This concern has contributed to a broader trend in graph representation learning toward augmentation-free methods, which view such structural changes as problematic and should be avoided. However, this trend overlooks the fundamental insight that structural changes from biologically meaningful perturbations are not a problem to be avoided, but rather a rich source of information, thereby ignoring the valuable opportunity to leverage data from real biological experiments. Motivated by this insight, we propose SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning), a new GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological perturbations from gene knockdown experiments as supervision. SupGCL is a probabilistic formulation that continuously generalizes conventional GCL, linking artificial augmentations with real perturbations measured in knockdown experiments, and using the latter as explicit supervision. On patient-derived GRNs from three cancer types, we train GRN representations with SupGCL and evaluate it in two regimes: (i) embedding space analysis, where it yields clearer disease-subtype structure and improves clustering, and (ii) task-specific fine-tuning, where it consistently outperforms strong graph representation learning baselines on 13 downstream tasks spanning gene-level functional annotation and patient-level prediction.</description><author>Sho Oshima, Yuji Okamoto, Taisei Tosaki, Ryosuke Kojima</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:13:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17786v5</guid></item><item><title>Modeling Distinct Human Interaction in Web Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17588v1</link><description>Despite rapid progress in autonomous web agents, human involvement remains essential for shaping preferences and correcting agent behavior as tasks unfold. However, current agentic systems lack a principled understanding of when and why humans intervene, often proceeding autonomously past critical decision points or requesting unnecessary confirmation. In this work, we introduce the task of modeling human intervention to support collaborative web task execution. We collect CowCorpus, a dataset of 400 real-user web navigation trajectories containing over 4,200 interleaved human and agent actions. We identify four distinct patterns of user interaction with agents -- hands-off supervision, hands-on oversight, collaborative task-solving, and full user takeover. Leveraging these insights, we train language models (LMs) to anticipate when users are likely to intervene based on their interaction styles, yielding a 61.4-63.4% improvement in intervention prediction accuracy over base LMs. Finally, we deploy these intervention-aware models in live web navigation agents and evaluate them in a user study, finding a 26.5% increase in user-rated agent usefulness. Together, our results show structured modeling of human intervention leads to more adaptive, collaborative agents.</description><author>Faria Huq, Zora Zhiruo Wang, Zhanqiu Guo, Venu Arvind Arangarajan, Tianyue Ou, Frank Xu, Shuyan Zhou, Graham Neubig, Jeffrey P.

We further propose an optimal test whose expected stopping time matches this lower bound asymptotically as $α\to 0$. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework through applications to sequential detection of model misspecification in Markov Chain Monte Carlo and to testing structural properties, such as the linearity of transition dynamics, in Markov decision processes. Our findings yield a sharp and general characterization of optimal sequential testing procedures under Markovian dependence.</description><author>Alhad Sethi, Kavali Sofia Sagar, Shubhada Agrawal, Debabrota Basu, P.

We present Deep-Flow, an unsupervised framework for safety-critical anomaly detection that utilizes Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM) to characterize the continuous probability density of expert human driving behavior. Unlike standard generative approaches that operate in unstable, high-dimensional coordinate spaces, Deep-Flow constrains the generative process to a low-rank spectral manifold via a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) bottleneck. This ensures kinematic smoothness by design and enables the computation of the exact Jacobian trace for numerically stable, deterministic log-likelihood estimation. To resolve multi-modal ambiguity at complex junctions, we utilize an Early Fusion Transformer encoder with lane-aware goal conditioning, featuring a direct skip-connection to the flow head to maintain intent-integrity throughout the network. We introduce a kinematic complexity weighting scheme that prioritizes high-energy maneuvers (quantified via path tortuosity and jerk) during the simulation-free training process. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our framework achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.766 against a heuristic golden set of safety-critical events. More significantly, our analysis reveals a fundamental distinction between kinematic danger and semantic non-compliance. Deep-Flow identifies a critical predictability gap by surfacing out-of-distribution behaviors, such as lane-boundary violations and non-normative junction maneuvers, that traditional safety filters overlook. This work provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for defining statistical safety gates, enabling objective, data-driven validation for the safe deployment of autonomous fleets.</description><author>Antonio Guillen-Perez</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:10:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17586v1</guid></item><item><title>Canonicalizing Multimodal Contrastive Representation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17584v1</link><description>As models and data scale, independently trained networks often induce analogous notions of similarity. But, matching similarities is weaker than establishing an explicit correspondence between the representation spaces, especially for multimodal models, where consistency must hold not only within each modality, but also for the learned image-text coupling. We therefore ask: given two independently trained multimodal contrastive models (with encoders $(f, g)$ and $(\widetilde{f},\widetilde{g})$) -- trained on different distributions and with different architectures -- does a systematic geometric relationship exist between their embedding spaces? If so, what form does it take, and does it hold uniformly across modalities? In this work, we show that across model families such as CLIP, SigLIP, and FLAVA, this geometric relationship is well approximated by an orthogonal map (up to a global mean shift), i.e., there exists an orthogonal map $Q$ where $Q^\top Q = I$ such that $\widetilde{f}(x)\approx Q f(x)$ for paired images $x$. Strikingly, the same $Q$ simultaneously aligns the text encoders i.e., $\widetilde{g}(y)\approx Q g(y)$ for texts $y$. Theoretically, we prove that if the multimodal kernel agrees across models on a small anchor set i.e. $\langle f(x), g(y)\rangle \approx \langle \widetilde{f}(x), \widetilde{g}(y)\rangle$, then the two models must be related by a single orthogonal map $Q$ and the same $Q$ maps images and text across models. More broadly, this finding enables backward-compatible model upgrades, avoiding costly re-embedding, and has implications for the privacy of learned representations.

These models rely on ODE/SDE solvers which integrate from a prior distribution to the data distribution. In many applications it is highly desirable to then integrate in the other direction. The standard solvers, however, accumulate discretization errors which don't align with the forward trajectory, thereby prohibiting an exact inversion. In applications where the precision of the generative model is paramount this inaccuracy in inversion is often unacceptable. Current approaches to solving the inversion of these models results in significant downstream issues with poor stability and low-order of convergence; moreover, they are strictly limited to the ODE domain. In this work, we propose a new family of reversible exponential (stochastic) Runge-Kutta solvers which we refer to as Rex developed by an application of Lawson methods to convert any explicit (stochastic) Runge-Kutta scheme into a reversible one. In addition to a rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed solvers, we also empirically demonstrate the utility of Rex on improving the sampling of Boltzmann distributions with flow models, and improving image generation and editing capabilities with diffusion models.</description><author>Zander W.

However, this conventional approach overlooks the potential benefits of jointly pre-training both encoder and decoder. In this paper, we propose DeCon, an efficient encoder-decoder self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that supports joint contrastive pre-training. We first extend existing SSL architectures to accommodate diverse decoders and their corresponding contrastive losses. Then, we introduce a weighted encoder-decoder contrastive loss with non-competing objectives to enable the joint pre-training of encoder-decoder architectures. By adapting a contrastive SSL framework for dense prediction, DeCon establishes consistent state-of-the-art performance on most of the evaluated tasks when pre-trained on Imagenet-1K, COCO and COCO+. Notably, when pre-training a ResNet-50 encoder on COCO dataset, DeCon improves COCO object detection and instance segmentation compared to the baseline framework by +0.37 AP and +0.32 AP, respectively, and boosts semantic segmentation by +1.42 mIoU on Pascal VOC and by +0.50 mIoU on Cityscapes. These improvements generalize across recent backbones, decoders, datasets, and dense tasks beyond segmentation and object detection, and persist in out-of-domain scenarios, including limited-data settings, demonstrating that joint pre-training significantly enhances representation quality for dense prediction.

This strategy is computationally efficient but the underlying constraint can be overly rigid for heterogeneous projection weights and may incur avoidable accuracy loss. We propose CoSpaDi (Compression via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a training-free framework that replaces low-rank factorization with a structured sparse decomposition in which each weight matrix is represented as a dense dictionary multiplied by a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This yields a union-of-subspaces model: the columns of the weight matrix are represented as linear combinations of different subsets of dictionary atoms, improving expressiveness at a fixed parameter budget. CoSpaDi is calibration-guided: using a small calibration set, we optimize the factorization to minimize functional reconstruction error of layer outputs rather than weight-space error. An activation-derived Gram orthonormalization reformulates this data-aware objective into a standard dictionary learning problem on transformed weights, and we support both per-layer compression and cross-layer dictionary sharing within groups of similar projections. Across Llama and Qwen model families, CoSpaDi consistently improves the accuracy--compression and perplexity--compression trade-offs over state-of-the-art SVD-based baselines and strong structured pruning baselines at 20-40\% compression ratios. The resulting structured sparsity enables sparse--dense computation and integrates with post-training quantization of the sparse coefficients.</description><author>Denis Makhov, Dmitriy Shopkhoev, Magauiya Zhussip, Ammar Ali, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 17:30:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22075v4</guid></item><item><title>Nonlinear Model Order Reduction of Dynamical Systems in Process Engineering: Review and Comparison</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12819v2</link><description>Computationally cheap yet accurate dynamical models are a key requirement for real-time capable nonlinear optimization and model-based control. When given a computationally expensive high-order prediction model, a reduction to a lower-order simplified model can enable such real-time applications. Herein, we review nonlinear model order reduction methods and provide a comparison of method characteristics. Additionally, we discuss both general-purpose methods and tailored approaches for chemical process systems and we identify similarities and differences between these methods. As machine learning manifold-Galerkin approaches currently do not account for inputs in the construction of the reduced state subspace, we extend these methods to dynamical systems with inputs. In a comparative case study, we apply eight established model order reduction methods to an air separation process model: POD-Galerkin, nonlinear-POD-Galerkin, manifold-Galerkin, dynamic mode decomposition, Koopman theory, manifold learning with latent predictor, compartment modeling, and model aggregation. Herein, we do not investigate hyperreduction, i.e., reduction of floating point operations. Based on our findings, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of the model order reduction methods.</description><author>Jan C.

In this work, we present the first formal analysis of how different normalization strategies, specifically instance-based and global scaling, impact the expressivity of Transformer-based architectures for time series representation learning. We propose a novel expressivity framework tailored to time series, which quantifies a model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs in the representation space. Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling. Our analysis reveals that the choice of normalization strategy can significantly influence the model's representational capacity, depending on the task and data characteristics. We complement our theory with empirical validation on classification and forecasting benchmarks using multiple Transformer-based models. Our results show that no single normalization method consistently outperforms others, and in some cases, omitting normalization entirely leads to superior performance. These findings highlight the critical role of preprocessing in time series learning and motivate the need for more principled normalization strategies tailored to specific tasks and datasets.</description><author>Sofiane Ennadir, Tianze Wang, Oleg Smirnov, Sahar Asadi, Lele Cao</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 17:23:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17568v1</guid></item><item><title>A Hybrid Federated Learning Based Ensemble Approach for Lung Disease Diagnosis Leveraging Fusion of SWIN Transformer and CNN</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17566v1</link><description>The significant advancements in computational power cre- ate a vast opportunity for using Artificial Intelligence in different ap- plications of healthcare and medical science.

Although SD has been empirically shown to often improve generalization, its formal guarantees remain limited. We study SD for ridge regression in unconstrained setting in which the mixing weight $ξ$ may be outside the unit interval. Conditioned on the training data and without any distributional assumptions, we prove that for any squared prediction risk (including out-of-distribution), the optimally mixed student strictly improves upon the ridge teacher for every regularization level $λ&gt; 0$ at which the teacher ridge risk $R(λ)$ is nonstationary (i.e., $R'(λ) \neq 0$). We obtain a closed-form expression for the optimal mixing weight $ξ^\star(λ)$ for any value of $λ$ and show that it obeys the sign rule: $\operatorname{sign}(ξ^\star(λ))=-\operatorname{sign}(R'(λ))$. In particular, $ξ^\star(λ)$ can be negative, which is the case in over-regularized regimes. To quantify the risk improvement due to SD, we derive exact deterministic equivalents for the optimal SD risk in the proportional asymptotics regime (where the sample and feature sizes $n$ and $p$ both diverge but their aspect ratio $p/n$ converges) under general anisotropic covariance and deterministic signals. Our asymptotic analysis extends standard second-order ridge deterministic equivalents to their fourth-order analogs using block linearization, which may be of independent interest. From a practical standpoint, we propose a consistent one-shot tuning method to estimate $ξ^\star$ without grid search, sample splitting, or refitting. Experiments on real-world datasets and pretrained neural network features support our theory and the one-shot tuning method.</description><author>Hien Dang, Pratik Patil, Alessandro Rinaldo</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 17:21:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17565v1</guid></item><item><title>A dependently-typed calculus of event telicity and culminativity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06968v2</link><description>We present a dependently-typed cross-linguistic framework for analyzing the telicity and culminativity of events, accompanied by examples of using our framework to model English sentences.

However, current methods suffer from two key limitations: \textit{(i)} the lack of a unified theoretical framework for guiding the design of steering directions, and \textit{(ii)} an over-reliance on \textit{one-step steering} that fail to capture complex patterns of activation distributions. In this work, we propose a unified ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based \textit{theoretical} framework for activation steering in LLM alignment. We show that conventional activation addition can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the solution of an ODE. Based on this ODE perspective, identifying a steering direction becomes equivalent to designing a \textit{barrier function} from control theory. Derived from this framework, we introduce ODESteer, a kind of ODE-based steering guided by barrier functions, which shows \textit{empirical} advancement in LLM alignment. ODESteer identifies steering directions by defining the barrier function as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and employs it to construct an ODE for \textit{multi-step and adaptive} steering. Compared to state-of-the-art activation steering methods, ODESteer achieves consistent empirical improvements on diverse LLM alignment benchmarks, a notable $5.7\%$ improvement over TruthfulQA, $2.5\%$ over UltraFeedback, and $2.4\%$ over RealToxicityPrompts.

However, weight regularization techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)-a key strategy in CL-remain underexplored in this new paradigm. In this paper, we revisit weight regularization in low-rank CL as a new perspective for mitigating task interference in PECL. Unlike existing low-rank CL methods, we mitigate task interference by regularizing a shared low-rank update through EWC, thereby keeping the storage requirement and inference costs constant regardless of the number of tasks. Our proposed method EWC-LoRA leverages a low-rank representation to estimate parameter importance over the full-dimensional space. This design offers a practical, computational- and memory-efficient solution for CL with PTMs, and provides insights that may inform the broader application of regularization techniques within PECL. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EWC-LoRA, achieving a stability-plasticity trade-off superior to existing low-rank CL approaches. These results indicate that, even under low-rank parameterizations, weight regularization remains an effective mechanism for mitigating task interference.

However, these models often inherit and amplify biases present in their training data. Although several datasets exist for bias detection, most are limited to one or two NLP tasks, typically classification or evaluation and do not provide broad coverage across diverse task settings. To address this gap, we introduce the \textbf{Bias Evaluations Across Domains} (\textbf{B}\texttt{EADs}) dataset, designed to support a wide range of NLP tasks, including text classification, token classification, bias quantification, and benign language generation. A key contribution of this work is a gold-standard annotation scheme that supports both evaluation and supervised training of language models. Experiments on state-of-the-art models reveal some gaps: some models exhibit systematic bias toward specific demographics, while others apply safety guardrails more strictly or inconsistently across groups. Overall, these results highlight persistent shortcomings in current models and underscore the need for comprehensive bias evaluation.

A promising direction is to use reinforcement learning (RL) to enable MLLMs to reason about and execute optimal tool-use plans within professional image-editing software. However, training remains challenging due to the lack of reliable, verifiable reward signals that can reflect the inherently subjective nature of creative editing. In this work, we introduce RetouchIQ, a framework that performs instruction-based executable image editing through MLLM agents guided by a generalist reward model. RetouchIQ interprets user-specified editing intentions and generates corresponding, executable image adjustments, bridging high-level aesthetic goals with precise parameter control. To move beyond conventional, rule-based rewards that compute similarity against a fixed reference image using handcrafted metrics, we propose a generalist reward model, an RL fine-tuned MLLM that evaluates edited results through a set of generated metrics on a case-by-case basis. Then, the reward model provides scalar feedback through multimodal reasoning, enabling reinforcement learning with high-quality, instruction-consistent gradients. We curate an extended dataset with 190k instruction-reasoning pairs and establish a new benchmark for instruction-based image editing. Experiments show that RetouchIQ substantially improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality over previous MLLM-based and diffusion-based editing systems. Our findings demonstrate the potential of generalist reward-driven MLLM agents as flexible, explainable, and executable assistants for professional image editing.</description><author>Qiucheng Wu, Jing Shi, Simon Jenni, Kushal Kafle, Tianyu Wang, Shiyu Chang, Handong Zhao</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 17:11:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17558v1</guid></item><item><title>Probability-Invariant Random Walk Learning on Gyral Folding-Based Cortical Similarity Networks for Alzheimer's and Lewy Body Dementia Diagnosis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17557v1</link><description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD) present overlapping clinical features yet require distinct diagnostic strategies. While neuroimaging-based brain network analysis is promising, atlas-based representations may obscure individualized anatomy. Gyral folding-based networks using three-hinge gyri provide a biologically grounded alternative, but inter-individual variability in cortical folding results in inconsistent landmark correspondence and highly irregular network sizes, violating the fixed-topology and node-alignment assumptions of most existing graph learning methods, particularly in clinical datasets where pathological changes further amplify anatomical heterogeneity. We therefore propose a probability-invariant random-walk-based framework that classifies individualized gyral folding networks without explicit node alignment. Cortical similarity networks are built from local morphometric features and represented by distributions of anonymized random walks, with an anatomy-aware encoding that preserves permutation invariance. Experiments on a large clinical cohort of AD and LBD subjects show consistent improvements over existing gyral folding and atlas-based models, demonstrating robustness and potential for dementia diagnosis.</description><author>Minheng Chen, Jing Zhang, Tong Chen, Chao Cao, Tianming Liu, Li Su, Dajiang Zhu</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 17:11:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17557v1</guid></item><item><title>Neural Implicit Representations for 3D Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17556v1</link><description>Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a tomographic sensor that measures 2D slices of the 3D spatial Fourier transform of the scene. In many operational scenarios, the measured set of 2D slices does not fill the 3D space in the Fourier domain, resulting in significant artifacts in the reconstructed imagery. Traditionally, simple priors, such as sparsity in the image domain, are used to regularize the inverse problem. In this paper, we review our recent work that achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D SAR imaging employing neural structures to model the surface scattering that dominates SAR returns. These neural structures encode the surface of the objects in the form of a signed distance function learned from the sparse scattering data. Since estimating a smooth surface from a sparse and noisy point cloud is an ill-posed problem, we regularize the surface estimation by sampling points from the implicit surface representation during the training step. We demonstrate the model's ability to represent target scattering using measured and simulated data from single vehicles and a larger scene with a large number of vehicles. We conclude with future research directions calling for methods to learn complex-valued neural representations to enable synthesizing new collections from the volumetric neural implicit representation.</description><author>Nithin Sugavanam, Emre Ertin</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 17:10:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17556v1</guid></item><item><title>GraphThinker: Reinforcing Video Reasoning with Event Graph Thinking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17555v1</link><description>Video reasoning requires understanding the causal relationships between events in a video. However, such relationships are often implicit and costly to annotate manually. While existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often infer event relations through dense captions or video summaries for video reasoning, such modeling still lacks causal understanding. Without explicit causal structure modeling within and across video events, these models suffer from hallucinations during the video reasoning. In this work, we propose GraphThinker, a reinforcement finetuning-based method that constructs structural event-level scene graphs and enhances visual grounding to jointly reduce hallucinations in video reasoning. Specifically, we first employ an MLLM to construct an event-based video scene graph (EVSG) that explicitly models both intra- and inter-event relations, and incorporate these formed scene graphs into the MLLM as an intermediate thinking process. We also introduce a visual attention reward during reinforcement finetuning, which strengthens video grounding and further mitigates hallucinations. We evaluate GraphThinker on two datasets, RexTime and VidHalluc, where it shows superior ability to capture object and event relations with more precise event localization, reducing hallucinations in video reasoning compared to prior methods.</description><author>Zixu Cheng, Da Li, Jian Hu, Ziquan Liu, Wei Li, Shaogang Gong</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 17:09:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17555v1</guid></item><item><title>A Theoretical Framework for Modular Learning of Robust Generative Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17554v1</link><description>Training large-scale generative models is resource-intensive and relies heavily on heuristic dataset weighting. We address two fundamental questions: Can we train Large Language Models (LLMs) modularly-combining small, domain-specific experts to match monolithic performance-and can we do so robustly for any data mixture, eliminating heuristic tuning? We present a theoretical framework for modular generative modeling where a set of pre-trained experts are combined via a gating mechanism. We define the space of normalized gating functions, $G_{1}$, and formulate the problem as a minimax game to find a single robust gate that minimizes divergence to the worst-case data mixture. We prove the existence of such a robust gate using Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and show that modularity acts as a strong regularizer, with generalization bounds scaling with the lightweight gate's complexity. Furthermore, we prove that this modular approach can theoretically outperform models retrained on aggregate data, with the gap characterized by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Finally, we introduce a scalable Stochastic Primal-Dual algorithm and a Structural Distillation method for efficient inference. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm that our modular architecture effectively mitigates gradient conflict and can robustly outperform monolithic baselines.</description><author>Corinna Cortes, Mehryar Mohri, Yutao Zhong</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 17:09:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17554v1</guid></item><item><title>MASPO: Unifying Gradient Utilization, Probability Mass, and Signal Reliability for Robust and Sample-Efficient LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17550v1</link><description>Existing Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) algorithms, such as GRPO, rely on rigid, uniform, and symmetric trust region mechanisms that are fundamentally misaligned with the complex optimization dynamics of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we identify three critical challenges in these methods: (1) inefficient gradient utilization caused by the binary cutoff of hard clipping, (2) insensitive probability mass arising from uniform ratio constraints that ignore the token distribution, and (3) asymmetric signal reliability stemming from the disparate credit assignment ambiguity between positive and negative samples. To bridge these gaps, we propose Mass-Adaptive Soft Policy Optimization (MASPO), a unified framework designed to harmonize these three dimensions. MASPO integrates a differentiable soft Gaussian gating to maximize gradient utility, a mass-adaptive limiter to balance exploration across the probability spectrum, and an asymmetric risk controller to align update magnitudes with signal confidence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MASPO serves as a robust, all-in-one RLVR solution, significantly outperforming strong baselines.

We consider the predictive performance of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for logistic regression, assessed in terms of logistic risk. We consider two questions: first, that of the existence of the MLE (which occurs when the dataset is not linearly separated), and second, that of its accuracy when it exists. These properties depend on both the dimension of covariates and the signal strength. In the case of Gaussian covariates and a well-specified logistic model, we obtain sharp non-asymptotic guarantees for the existence and excess logistic risk of the MLE. We then generalize these results in two ways: first, to non-Gaussian covariates satisfying a certain two-dimensional margin condition, and second to the general case of statistical learning with a possibly misspecified logistic model. Finally, we consider the case of a Bernoulli design, where the behavior of the MLE is highly sensitive to the parameter direction.</description><author>Hugo Chardon, Matthieu Lerasle, Jaouad Mourtada</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 17:02:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02137v3</guid></item><item><title>KLong: Training LLM Agent for Extremely Long-horizon Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17547v1</link><description>This paper introduces KLong, an open-source LLM agent trained to solve extremely long-horizon tasks. The principle is to first cold-start the model via trajectory-splitting SFT, then scale it via progressive RL training. Specifically, we first activate basic agentic abilities of a base model with a comprehensive SFT recipe. Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories. In addition, to further improve long-horizon task-solving capability, we propose a novel progressive RL, which schedules training into multiple stages with progressively extended timeouts. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and generalization of KLong, as shown in Figure 1. Notably, our proposed KLong (106B) surpasses Kimi K2 Thinking (1T) by 11.28% on PaperBench, and the performance improvement generalizes to other coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and MLE-bench.</description><author>Yue Liu, Zhiyuan Hu, Flood Sung, Jiaheng Zhang, Bryan Hooi</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 17:01:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17547v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning to Stay Safe: Adaptive Regularization Against Safety Degradation during Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17546v1</link><description>Instruction-following language models are trained to be helpful and safe, yet their safety behavior can deteriorate under benign fine-tuning and worsen under adversarial updates. Existing defenses often offer limited protection or force a trade-off between safety and utility. We introduce a training framework that adapts regularization in response to safety risk, enabling models to remain aligned throughout fine-tuning. To estimate safety risk at training time, we explore two distinct approaches: a judge-based Safety Critic that assigns high-level harm scores to training batches, and an activation-based risk predictor built with a lightweight classifier trained on intermediate model activations to estimate harmful intent. Each approach provides a risk signal that is used to constrain updates deemed higher risk to remain close to a safe reference policy, while lower-risk updates proceed with standard training. We empirically verify that harmful intent signals are predictable from pre-generation activations and that judge scores provide effective high-recall safety guidance. Across multiple model families and attack scenarios, adaptive regularization with either risk estimation approach consistently lowers attack success rate compared to standard fine-tuning, preserves downstream performance, and adds no inference-time cost. This work demonstrates a principled mechanism for maintaining safety without sacrificing utility.</description><author>Jyotin Goel, Souvik Maji, Pratik Mazumder</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:59:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17546v1</guid></item><item><title>Adaptive Decentralized Composite Optimization via Three-Operator Splitting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17545v1</link><description>The paper studies decentralized optimization over networks, where agents minimize a sum of {\it locally} smooth (strongly) convex losses and plus a nonsmooth convex extended value term. We propose decentralized methods wherein agents {\it adaptively} adjust their stepsize via local backtracking procedures coupled with lightweight min-consensus protocols. Our design stems from a three-operator splitting factorization applied to an equivalent reformulation of the problem. The reformulation is endowed with a new BCV preconditioning metric (Bertsekas-O'Connor-Vandenberghe), which enables efficient decentralized implementation and local stepsize adjustments. We establish robust convergence guarantees. Under mere convexity, the proposed methods converge with a sublinear rate. Under strong convexity of the sum-function, and assuming the nonsmooth component is partly smooth, we further prove linear convergence. Numerical experiments corroborate the theory and highlight the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive stepsize strategy.</description><author>Xiaokai Chen, Ilya Kuruzov, Gesualdo Scutari</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:59:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17545v1</guid></item><item><title>Evaluating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through Reusability and Verifiability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17544v1</link><description>In multi-agent IR pipelines for tasks such as search and ranking, LLM-based agents exchange intermediate reasoning in terms of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with each other. Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma.</description><author>Shashank Aggarwal, Ram Vikas Mishra, Amit Awekar</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:59:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17544v1</guid></item><item><title>genriesz: A Python Package for Automatic Debiased Machine Learning with Generalized Riesz Regression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17543v1</link><description>Efficient estimation of causal and structural parameters can be automated using the Riesz representation theorem and debiased machine learning (DML). We present genriesz, an open-source Python package that implements automatic DML and generalized Riesz regression, a unified framework for estimating Riesz representers by minimizing empirical Bregman divergences. This framework includes covariate balancing, nearest-neighbor matching, calibrated estimation, and density ratio estimation as special cases. A key design principle of the package is automatic regressor balancing (ARB): given a Bregman generator $g$ and a representer model class, genriesz} automatically constructs a compatible link function so that the generalized Riesz regression estimator satisfies balancing (moment-matching) optimality conditions in a user-chosen basis. The package provides a modulr interface for specifying (i) the target linear functional via a black-box evaluation oracle, (ii) the representer model via basis functions (polynomial, RKHS approximations, random forest leaf encodings, neural embeddings, and a nearest-neighbor catchment basis), and (iii) the Bregman generator, with optional user-supplied derivatives. It returns regression adjustment (RA), Riesz weighting (RW), augmented Riesz weighting (ARW), and TMLE-style estimators with cross-fitting, confidence intervals, and $p$-values. We highlight representative workflows for estimation problems such as the average treatment effect (ATE), ATE on treated (ATT), and average marginal effect estimation.

However, KC-level correctness labels are rarely available in real-world datasets, especially for open-ended programming tasks where solutions typically involve multiple KCs simultaneously. Simply propagating problem-level correctness to all associated KCs obscures partial mastery and often leads to poorly fitted learning curves. To address this challenge, we propose an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to label KC-level correctness directly from student-written code. Our method assesses whether each KC is correctly applied and further introduces a temporal context-aware Code-KC mapping mechanism to better align KCs with individual student code. We evaluate the resulting KC-level correctness labels in terms of learning curve fit and predictive performance using the power law of practice and the Additive Factors Model. Experimental results show that our framework leads to learning curves that are more consistent with cognitive theory and improves predictive performance, compared to baselines. Human evaluation further demonstrates substantial agreement between LLM and expert annotations.</description><author>Zhangqi Duan, Arnav Kankaria, Dhruv Kartik, Andrew Lan</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:58:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17542v1</guid></item><item><title>Diffusion-Guided Pretraining for Brain Graph Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09437v2</link><description>With the growing interest in foundation models for brain signals, graph-based pretraining has emerged as a promising paradigm for learning transferable representations from connectome data. However, existing contrastive and masked autoencoder methods typically rely on naive random dropping or masking for augmentation, which is ill-suited for brain graphs and hypergraphs as it disrupts semantically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions. Extensive experiments across multiple neuroimaging datasets with over 25,000 subjects and 60,000 scans involving various mental disorders and brain atlases demonstrate consistent performance improvements.</description><author>Xinxu Wei, Rong Zhou, Lifang He, Yu Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:57:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09437v2</guid></item><item><title>IRIS: Learning-Driven Task-Specific Cinema Robot Arm for Visuomotor Motion Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17537v1</link><description>Robotic camera systems enable dynamic, repeatable motion beyond human capabilities, yet their adoption remains limited by the high cost and operational complexity of industrial-grade platforms.

In many cases, despite the algorithm's superior performance, the final decision remains in human hands. For example, an AI may assist doctors in determining which diagnostic tests to run, but the doctor ultimately makes the diagnosis. This paper studies such AI-assisted decision-making settings, where the human learns through repeated interactions with the algorithm. In our framework, the algorithm -- designed to maximize decision accuracy according to its own model -- determines which features the human can consider. The human then makes a prediction based on their own less accurate model. We observe that the discrepancy between the algorithm's model and the human's model creates a fundamental tradeoff: Should the algorithm prioritize recommending more informative features, encouraging the human to learn their importance, even if it results in less accurate predictions in the short term until learning occurs? Or is it preferable to forgo educating the human and instead select features that align more closely with their existing understanding, minimizing the immediate cost of learning? Our analysis reveals how this trade-off is shaped by both the algorithm's patience (the time-discount rate of its objective over multiple periods) and the human's willingness and ability to learn. We show that optimal feature selection has a surprisingly clean combinatorial characterization, reducible to a stationary sequence of feature subsets that is tractable to compute. As the algorithm becomes more "patient" or the human's learning improves, the algorithm increasingly selects more informative features, enhancing both prediction accuracy and the human's understanding.</description><author>Gali Noti, Kate Donahue, Jon Kleinberg, Sigal Oren</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:49:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13062v2</guid></item><item><title>Oversmoothing, Oversquashing, Heterophily, Long-Range, and more: Demystifying Common Beliefs in Graph Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15547v3</link><description>After a renaissance phase in which researchers revisited the message-passing paradigm through the lens of deep learning, the graph machine learning community shifted its attention towards a deeper and practical understanding of message-passing's benefits and limitations. In this paper, we notice how the fast pace of progress around the topics of oversmoothing and oversquashing, the homophily-heterophily dichotomy, and long-range tasks, came with the consolidation of commonly accepted beliefs and assumptions -- under the form of universal statements -- that are not always true nor easy to distinguish from each other. We argue that this has led to ambiguities around the investigated problems, preventing researchers from focusing on and addressing precise research questions while causing a good amount of misunderstandings. Our contribution is to make such common beliefs explicit and encourage critical thinking around these topics, refuting universal statements via simple yet formally sufficient counterexamples.

Split conformal prediction (SCP) offers finite-sample coverage, yet prediction sets often become large (low efficiency) and class-wise coverage unbalanced-high class-conditioned coverage gap (CCV), especially in few-shot, imbalanced regimes; moreover, naively adapting to calibration labels breaks exchangeability and voids guarantees. We propose \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} (Laplacian-Assisted Transductive Adaptation), a \textit{training- and label-free} refinement that operates on the joint calibration and test pool by smoothing zero-shot probabilities over an image-image k-NN graph using a small number of CCCP mean-field updates, preserving SCP validity via a deterministic transform. We further introduce a \textit{failure-aware} conformal score that plugs into the vision-language uncertainty (ViLU) framework, providing instance-level difficulty and label plausibility to improve prediction set efficiency and class-wise balance at fixed coverage. \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} is black-box (no VLM updates), compute-light (windowed transduction, no backprop), and includes an optional prior knob that can run strictly label-free or, if desired, in a label-informed variant using calibration marginals once. Across \textbf{three} medical VLMs and \textbf{nine} downstream tasks, \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} consistently reduces set size and CCV while matching or tightening target coverage, outperforming prior transductive baselines and narrowing the gap to label-using methods, while using far less compute.

The field has largely converged on three public multi-label benchmarks (PTB-XL, CPSC2018, CSN) dominated by arrhythmia and waveform-morphology labels, even though the ECG is known to encode substantially broader clinical information. We argue that downstream evaluation should expand to include an assessment of structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting, in addition to other evolving ECG-related endpoints, as relevant clinical targets. Next, we outline evaluation best practices for multi-label, imbalanced settings, and show that when they are applied, the literature's current conclusion about which representations perform best is altered. Furthermore, we demonstrate the surprising result that a randomly initialized encoder with linear evaluation matches state-of-the-art pre-training on many tasks. This motivates the use of a random encoder as a reasonable baseline model. We substantiate our observations with an empirical evaluation of three representative ECG pre-training approaches across six evaluation settings: the three standard benchmarks, a structural disease dataset, hemodynamic inference, and patient forecasting.</description><author>Zachary Berger, Daniel Prakah-Asante, John Guttag, Collin M.

A key approach for obtaining explanations with provable guarantees is by identifying a cardinally-minimal subset of input features which by itself is provably sufficient to determine the prediction. However, for standard neural networks, this task is often computationally infeasible, as it demands a worst-case exponential number of verification queries in the number of input features, each of which is NP-hard. In this work, we show that for Neural Additive Models (NAMs), a recent and more interpretable neural network family, we can efficiently generate explanations with such guarantees. We present a new model-specific algorithm for NAMs that generates provably cardinally-minimal explanations using only a logarithmic number of verification queries in the number of input features, after a parallelized preprocessing step with logarithmic runtime in the required precision is applied to each small univariate NAM component. Our algorithm not only makes the task of obtaining cardinally-minimal explanations feasible, but even outperforms existing algorithms designed to find the relaxed variant of subset-minimal explanations - which may be larger and less informative but easier to compute - despite our algorithm solving a much more difficult task. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to previous algorithms, our approach provides provably smaller explanations than existing works and substantially reduces the computation time. Moreover, we show that our generated provable explanations offer benefits that are unattainable by standard sampling-based techniques typically used to interpret NAMs.</description><author>Shahaf Bassan, Yizhak Yisrael Elboher, Tobias Ladner, Volkan Şahin, Jan Kretinsky, Matthias Althoff, Guy Katz</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:42:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17530v1</guid></item><item><title>Enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for Telecom using Dynamic Knowledge Graphs and Explainable Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17529v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential across a variety of tasks, but their application in the telecom field remains challenging due to domain complexity, evolving standards, and specialized terminology. Therefore, general-domain LLMs may struggle to provide accurate and reliable outputs in this context, leading to increased hallucinations and reduced utility in telecom operations.To address these limitations, this work introduces KG-RAG-a novel framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KGs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance LLMs for telecom-specific tasks. In particular, the KG provides a structured representation of domain knowledge derived from telecom standards and technical documents, while RAG enables dynamic retrieval of relevant facts to ground the model's outputs. Such a combination improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucination, and ensures compliance with telecom specifications.Experimental results across benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-RAG outperforms both LLM-only and standard RAG baselines, e.g., KG-RAG achieves an average accuracy improvement of 14.3% over RAG and 21.6% over LLM-only models. These results highlight KG-RAG's effectiveness in producing accurate, reliable, and explainable outputs in complex telecom scenarios.</description><author>Dun Yuan, Hao Zhou, Xue Liu, Hao Chen, Yan Xin, Jianzhong, Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:40:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17529v1</guid></item><item><title>The Anxiety of Influence: Bloom Filters in Transformer Attention Heads</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17526v1</link><description>Some transformer attention heads appear to function as membership testers, dedicating themselves to answering the question "has this token appeared before in the context?" We identify these heads across four language models (GPT-2 small, medium, and large; Pythia-160M) and show that they form a spectrum of membership-testing strategies. Two heads (L0H1 and L0H5 in GPT-2 small) function as high-precision membership filters with false positive rates of 0-4\% even at 180 unique context tokens -- well above the $d_\text{head} = 64$ bit capacity of a classical Bloom filter. A third head (L1H11) shows the classic Bloom filter capacity curve: its false positive rate follows the theoretical formula $p \approx (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k$ with $R^2 = 1.0$ and fitted capacity $m \approx 5$ bits, saturating by $n \approx 20$ unique tokens. A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact. Together, the three genuine membership-testing heads form a multi-resolution system concentrated in early layers (0-1), taxonomically distinct from induction and previous-token heads, with false positive rates that decay monotonically with embedding distance -- consistent with distance-sensitive Bloom filters. These heads generalize broadly: they respond to any repeated token type, not just repeated names, with 43\% higher generalization than duplicate-token-only heads. Ablation reveals these heads contribute to both repeated and novel token processing, indicating that membership testing coexists with broader computational roles. The reclassification of L3H0 through confound controls strengthens rather than weakens the case: the surviving heads withstand the scrutiny that eliminated a false positive in our own analysis.</description><author>Peter Balogh</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:37:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17526v1</guid></item><item><title>Variational inference via radial transport</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17525v1</link><description>In variational inference (VI), the practitioner approximates a high-dimensional distribution $π$ with a simple surrogate one, often a (product) Gaussian distribution.

In this work, we approach the VI problem from the perspective of optimizing over these radial profiles. Our algorithm radVI is a cheap, effective add-on to many existing VI schemes, such as Gaussian (mean-field) VI and Laplace approximation. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for our algorithm, owing to recent developments in optimization over the Wasserstein space--the space of probability distributions endowed with the Wasserstein distance--and new regularity properties of radial transport maps in the style of Caffarelli (2000).</description><author>Luca Ghafourpour, Sinho Chewi, Alessio Figalli, Aram-Alexandre Pooladian</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:36:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17525v1</guid></item><item><title>Laser interferometry as a robust neuromorphic platform for machine learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18047v3</link><description>We present a method for implementing an optical neural network using only linear optical resources, namely field displacement and interferometry applied to coherent states of light.

We integrate laparoscopic depth maps with a foundation pose estimator for camera-liver pose estimation and replace FE-based deformation with non-rigid iterative closest point (NICP) to lower engineering/modeling complexity and expertise requirements. On real patient data, the depth-augmented foundation pose approach achieved 9.91 mm mean registration error in 3 cases.

Our study addresses the critical gap in evaluating LLM physical safety by developing a comprehensive benchmark for drone control. We classify the physical safety risks of drones into four categories: (1) human-targeted threats, (2) object-targeted threats, (3) infrastructure attacks, and (4) regulatory violations. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals an undesirable trade-off between utility and safety, with models that excel in code generation often performing poorly in crucial safety aspects. Furthermore, while incorporating advanced prompt engineering techniques such as In-Context Learning and Chain-of-Thought can improve safety, these methods still struggle to identify unintentional attacks. In addition, larger models demonstrate better safety capabilities, particularly in refusing dangerous commands. Our findings and benchmark can facilitate the design and evaluation of physical safety for LLMs. The project page is available at huggingface.co/spaces/TrustSafeAI/LLM-physical-safety.</description><author>Yung-Chen Tang, Pin-Yu Chen, Tsung-Yi Ho</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:30:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02317v2</guid></item><item><title>Bridging the Domain Divide: Supervised vs. Zero-Shot Clinical Section Segmentation from MIMIC-III to Obstetrics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17513v1</link><description>Clinical free-text notes contain vital patient information. They are structured into labelled sections; recognizing these sections has been shown to support clinical decision-making and downstream NLP tasks. In this paper, we advance clinical section segmentation through three key contributions. First, we curate a new de-identified, section-labeled obstetrics notes dataset, to supplement the medical domains covered in public corpora such as MIMIC-III, on which most existing segmentation approaches are trained. Second, we systematically evaluate transformer-based supervised models for section segmentation on a curated subset of MIMIC-III (in-domain), and on the new obstetrics dataset (out-of-domain). Third, we conduct the first head-to-head comparison of supervised models for medical section segmentation with zero-shot large language models. Our results show that while supervised models perform strongly in-domain, their performance drops substantially out-of-domain. In contrast, zero-shot models demonstrate robust out-of-domain adaptability once hallucinated section headers are corrected. These findings underscore the importance of developing domain-specific clinical resources and highlight zero-shot segmentation as a promising direction for applying healthcare NLP beyond well-studied corpora, as long as hallucinations are appropriately managed.</description><author>Baris Karacan, Barbara Di Eugenio, Patrick Thornton</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:25:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17513v1</guid></item><item><title>Capturing Individual Human Preferences with Reward Features</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17338v2</link><description>Reinforcement learning from human feedback usually models preferences using a reward function that does not distinguish between people. We argue that this is unlikely to be a good design choice in contexts with high potential for disagreement, like in the training of large language models. We formalise and analyse the problem of learning a reward model that can be specialised to a user. Using the principle of empirical risk minimisation, we derive a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound showing the dependency of the approximation error on the number of training examples, as usual, and also on the number of human raters who provided feedback on them. Based on our theoretical findings, we discuss how to best collect pairwise preference data and argue that adaptive reward models should be beneficial when there is considerable disagreement among users. We also propose a concrete architecture for an adaptive reward model. Our approach leverages the observation that individual preferences can be captured as a linear combination of a set of general reward features. We show how to learn such features and subsequently use them to quickly adapt the reward model to a specific individual, even if their preferences are not reflected in the training data. We present experiments with large language models illustrating our theoretical results and comparing the proposed architecture with a non-adaptive baseline. Consistent with our analysis, the benefits provided by our model increase with the number of raters and the heterogeneity of their preferences. We also show that our model compares favourably to adaptive counterparts, including those performing in-context personalisation.</description><author>André Barreto, Vincent Dumoulin, Yiran Mao, Mark Rowland, Nicolas Perez-Nieves, Bobak Shahriari, Yann Dauphin, Doina Precup, Hugo Larochelle</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:23:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17338v2</guid></item><item><title>LORA-CRAFT: Cross-layer Rank Adaptation via Frozen Tucker Decomposition of Pre-trained Attention Weights</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17510v1</link><description>We introduce CRAFT (Cross-layer Rank Adaptation via Frozen Tucker), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that applies Tucker tensor decomposition to pre-trained attention weight matrices stacked across transformer layers and trains only small square adaptation matrices on the resulting frozen Tucker factors. Existing tensor-based PEFT methods decompose gradient updates: LoTR applies Tucker decomposition with shared factor matrices, while SuperLoRA groups and reshapes $ΔW$ across layers before applying Tucker decomposition. Separately, methods like PiSSA apply SVD to pre-trained weights but operate independently per layer. CRAFT bridges these two lines of work: it performs full Tucker decomposition via Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD) directly on pre-trained weights organized as cross-layer 3D tensors, freezes all resulting factors, and adapts the model through lightweight trainable transformations applied to each factor matrix. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark using RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large demonstrate that CRAFT achieves competitive performance with existing methods while requiring only 41K Tucker adaptation parameters--a count independent of model dimension and depth at fixed Tucker ranks.</description><author>Kasun Dewage, Marianna Pensky, Suranadi De Silva, Shankadeep Mondal</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:22:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17510v1</guid></item><item><title>Pareto Optimal Benchmarking of AI Models on ARM Cortex Processors for Sustainable Embedded Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17508v1</link><description>This work presents a practical benchmarking framework for optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) models on ARM Cortex processors (M0+, M4, M7), focusing on energy efficiency, accuracy, and resource utilization in embedded systems. Through the design of an automated test bench, we provide a systematic approach to evaluate across key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify optimal combinations of processor and AI model. The research highlights a nearlinear correlation between floating-point operations (FLOPs) and inference time, offering a reliable metric for estimating computational demands. Using Pareto analysis, we demonstrate how to balance trade-offs between energy consumption and model accuracy, ensuring that AI applications meet performance requirements without compromising sustainability. Key findings indicate that the M7 processor is ideal for short inference cycles, while the M4 processor offers better energy efficiency for longer inference tasks. The M0+ processor, while less efficient for complex AI models, remains suitable for simpler tasks. This work provides insights for developers, guiding them to design energy-efficient AI systems that deliver high performance in realworld applications.</description><author>Pranay Jain, Maximilian Kasper, Göran Köber, Axel Plinge, Dominik Seuß</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:21:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17508v1</guid></item><item><title>Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models with Intrinsic Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00794v3</link><description>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning ability of large language models, yet training remains costly because many rollouts contribute little to optimization, considering the amount of computation required. This study investigates how simply leveraging intrinsic data properties, almost free benefit during training, can improve data efficiency for RLVR. We propose PREPO with two complementary components. First, we adopt prompt perplexity as an indicator of model adaptability in learning, enabling the model to progress from well-understood contexts to more challenging ones. Second, we amplify the discrepancy among the rollouts by differentiating their relative entropy, and prioritize sequences that exhibit a higher degree of exploration. Together, these mechanisms reduce rollout demand while preserving competitive performance. On the Qwen and Llama models, PREPO achieves effective results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with up to 3 times fewer rollouts than the baselines. Beyond empirical gains, we provide theoretical and in-depth analyses explaining the underlying rationale of our method to improve the data efficiency of RLVR.</description><author>Yan Sun, Jia Guo, Stanley Kok, Zihao Wang, Zujie Wen, Zhiqiang Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:18:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00794v3</guid></item><item><title>Generating Directed Graphs with Dual Attention and Asymmetric Encoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16404v3</link><description>Directed graphs naturally model systems with asymmetric, ordered relationships, essential to applications in biology, transportation, social networks, and visual understanding. Generating such graphs enables tasks such as simulation, data augmentation and novel instance discovery; however, directed graph generation remains underexplored. We identify two key factors limiting progress in this direction: first, modeling edge directionality introduces a substantially larger dependency space, making the underlying distribution harder to learn; second, the absence of standardized benchmarks hinders rigorous evaluation. Addressing the former requires more expressive models that are sensitive to directional topologies. We propose Directo, the first generative model for directed graphs built upon the discrete flow matching framework. Our approach combines: (i) principled positional encodings tailored to asymmetric pairwise relations, (ii) a dual-attention mechanism capturing both incoming and outgoing dependencies, and (iii) a robust, discrete generative framework. To support evaluation, we introduce a benchmark suite covering synthetic and real-world datasets. It shows that our method performs strongly across diverse settings and even competes with specialized models for particular classes, such as directed acyclic graphs. Our results highlight the effectiveness and generality of our approach, establishing a solid foundation for future research in directed graph generation.</description><author>Alba Carballo-Castro, Manuel Madeira, Yiming Qin, Dorina Thanou, Pascal Frossard</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:14:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16404v3</guid></item><item><title>Retrospective In-Context Learning for Temporal Credit Assignment with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17497v1</link><description>Learning from self-sampled data and sparse environmental feedback remains a fundamental challenge in training self-evolving agents. Temporal credit assignment mitigates this issue by transforming sparse feedback into dense supervision signals. However, previous approaches typically depend on learning task-specific value functions for credit assignment, which suffer from poor sample efficiency and limited generalization. In this work, we propose to leverage pretrained knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to transform sparse rewards into dense training signals (i.e., the advantage function) through retrospective in-context learning (RICL). We further propose an online learning framework, RICOL, which iteratively refines the policy based on the credit assignment results from RICL. We empirically demonstrate that RICL can accurately estimate the advantage function with limited samples and effectively identify critical states in the environment for temporal credit assignment. Extended evaluation on four BabyAI scenarios show that RICOL achieves comparable convergent performance with traditional online RL algorithms with significantly higher sample efficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs for temporal credit assignment, paving the way for more sample-efficient and generalizable RL paradigms.</description><author>Wen-Tse Chen, Jiayu Chen, Fahim Tajwar, Hao Zhu, Xintong Duan, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Jeff Schneider</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:13:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17497v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning with Boolean threshold functions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17493v1</link><description>We develop a method for training neural networks on Boolean data in which the values at all nodes are strictly $\pm 1$, and the resulting models are typically equivalent to networks whose nonzero weights are also $\pm 1$. The method replaces loss minimization with a nonconvex constraint formulation. Each node implements a Boolean threshold function (BTF), and training is expressed through a divide-and-concur decomposition into two complementary constraints: one enforces local BTF consistency between inputs, weights, and output; the other imposes architectural concurrence, equating neuron outputs with downstream inputs and enforcing weight equality across training-data instantiations of the network. The reflect-reflect-relax (RRR) projection algorithm is used to reconcile these constraints. Each BTF constraint includes a lower bound on the margin. When this bound is sufficiently large, the learned representations are provably sparse and equivalent to networks composed of simple logical gates with $\pm 1$ weights. Across a range of tasks -- including multiplier-circuit discovery, binary autoencoding, logic-network inference, and cellular automata learning -- the method achieves exact solutions or strong generalization in regimes where standard gradient-based methods struggle. These results demonstrate that projection-based constraint satisfaction provides a viable and conceptually distinct foundation for learning in discrete neural systems, with implications for interpretability and efficient inference.</description><author>Veit Elser, Manish Krishan Lal</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:07:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17493v1</guid></item><item><title>Entropy After $\langle \texttt{/Think} \rangle$ for reasoning model early exiting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26522v2</link><description>Reasoning LLMs show improved performance with longer chains of thought. However, recent work has highlighted their tendency to overthink, continuing to revise answers even after reaching the correct solution. We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency from the distribution dynamics perspective by tracking Pass@1 for answers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find the model often begins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making extra reasoning tokens wasteful. To detect and prevent overthinking, we propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal, Entropy After &lt;/Think&gt; (EAT), for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a stop thinking token (&lt;/think&gt;) and monitoring the entropy of the following token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token usage by 12 - 22% without harming accuracy. EAT also remains effective in black box settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT is computed with proxy models: We verified the feasibility via early stopping Llama 70B with a 1.5B model and Claude 3.7 with a local 4B model.</description><author>Xi Wang, James McInerney, Lequn Wang, Nathan Kallus</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:04:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26522v2</guid></item><item><title>LoRA-Squeeze: Simple and Effective Post-Tuning and In-Tuning Compression of LoRA Modules</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10993v2</link><description>Despite its huge number of variants, standard Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is still a dominant technique for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Nonetheless, it faces persistent challenges, including the pre-selection of an optimal rank and rank-specific hyper-parameters, as well as the deployment complexity of heterogeneous-rank modules and more sophisticated LoRA derivatives. In this work, we introduce LoRA-Squeeze, a simple and efficient methodology that aims to improve standard LoRA learning by changing LoRA module ranks either post-hoc or dynamically during training}. Our approach posits that it is better to first learn an expressive, higher-rank solution and then compress it, rather than learning a constrained, low-rank solution directly. The method involves fine-tuning with a deliberately high(er) source rank, reconstructing or efficiently approximating the reconstruction of the full weight update matrix, and then using Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) to create a new, compressed LoRA module at a lower target rank. Extensive experiments across 13 text and 10 vision-language tasks show that post-hoc compression often produces lower-rank adapters that outperform those trained directly at the target rank, especially if a small number of fine-tuning steps at the target rank is allowed. Moreover, a gradual, in-tuning rank annealing variant of LoRA-Squeeze consistently achieves the best LoRA size-performance trade-off.</description><author>Ivan Vulić, Adam Grycner, Quentin de Laroussilhe, Jonas Pfeiffer</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 15:57:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10993v2</guid></item><item><title>Linear Convergence in Games with Delayed Feedback via Extra Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17486v1</link><description>Feedback delays are inevitable in real-world multi-agent learning. They are known to severely degrade performance, and the convergence rate under delayed feedback is still unclear, even for bilinear games. This paper derives the rate of linear convergence of Weighted Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent (WOGDA), which predicts future rewards with extra optimism, in unconstrained bilinear games. To analyze the algorithm, we interpret it as an approximation of the Extra Proximal Point (EPP), which is updated based on farther future rewards than the classical Proximal Point (PP). Our theorems show that standard optimism (predicting the next-step reward) achieves linear convergence to the equilibrium at a rate $\exp(-Θ(t/m^{5}))$ after $t$ iterations for delay $m$. Moreover, employing extra optimism (predicting farther future reward) tolerates a larger step size and significantly accelerates the rate to $\exp(-Θ(t/(m^{2}\log m)))$. Our experiments also show accelerated convergence driven by the extra optimism and are qualitatively consistent with our theorems. In summary, this paper validates that extra optimism is a promising countermeasure against performance degradation caused by feedback delays.</description><author>Yuma Fujimoto, Kenshi Abe, Kaito Ariu</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 15:56:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17486v1</guid></item><item><title>PyRadiomics-cuda: 3D features extraction from medical images for HPC using GPU acceleration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02894v2</link><description>PyRadiomics-cuda is a GPU-accelerated extension of the PyRadiomics library, designed to address the computational challenges of extracting three-dimensional shape features from medical images.

We audit PD across eight LLMs (3 open-source; 5 API-based, including GPT-4o), introduce LMP2 (Language Model Privacy Probe), a human-centered, privacy-preserving audit tool refined through two formative studies (N=20), and run two studies with EU residents to capture (i) intuitions about LLM-generated PD (N1=155) and (ii) reactions to tool output (N2=303). We show empirically that models confidently generate multiple PD categories for well-known individuals. For everyday users, GPT-4o generates 11 features with 60% or more accuracy (e.g., gender, hair color, languages).
