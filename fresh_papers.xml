Due to the wide variety of human identities,poses, and stochastic details, the generation of 3D human meshes has been achallenging problem. To address this, we decompose the problem into 2D normalmap generation and normal map-based 3D reconstruction. Specifically, we firstsimultaneously generate realistic normal maps for the front and backside of aclothed human, dubbed dual normal maps, using a pose-conditional diffusionmodel. For 3D reconstruction, we ``carve'' the prior SMPL-X mesh to a detailed3D mesh according to the normal maps through mesh optimization. To furtherenhance the high-frequency details, we present a diffusion resampling scheme onboth body and facial regions, thus encouraging the generation of realisticdigital avatars. We also seamlessly incorporate a recent text-to-imagediffusion model to support text-based human identity control. Our method,namely, Chupa, is capable of generating realistic 3D clothed humans with betterperceptual quality and identity variety.</description><author>Byungjun Kim, Patrick Kwon, Kwangho Lee, Myunggi Lee, Sookwan Han, Daesik Kim, Hanbyul Joo</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 18:59:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11870v1</guid></item><item><title>Photo-zSNthesis: Converting Type Ia Supernova Lightcurves to Redshift Estimates via Deep Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11869v1</link><description>Upcoming photometric surveys will discover tens of thousands of Type Iasupernovae (SNe Ia), vastly outpacing the capacity of our spectroscopicresources. In order to maximize the science return of these observations in theabsence of spectroscopic information, we must accurately extract keyparameters, such as SN redshifts, with photometric information alone.

We show major improvements over predictions from existing methods on bothsimulations and real observations as well as minimal redshift-dependent bias,which is a challenge due to selection effects, e.g. Malmquist bias.

Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Machine Learning on Microcontrollers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11899v2</link><description>The sustained growth of carbon emissions and global waste elicits significantsustainability concerns for our environment's future. The growing Internet ofThings (IoT) has the potential to exacerbate this issue. However, an emergingarea known as Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) has the opportunity to helpaddress these environmental challenges through sustainable computing practices.TinyML, the deployment of machine learning (ML) algorithms onto low-cost,low-power microcontroller systems, enables on-device sensor analytics thatunlocks numerous always-on ML applications. This article discusses both thepotential of these TinyML applications to address critical sustainabilitychallenges, as well as the environmental footprint of this emerging technology.Through a complete life cycle analysis (LCA), we find that TinyML systemspresent opportunities to offset their carbon emissions by enabling applicationsthat reduce the emissions of other sectors. Nevertheless, when globally scaled,the carbon footprint of TinyML systems is not negligible, necessitating thatdesigners factor in environmental impact when formulating new devices. Finally,we outline research directions to enable further sustainable contributions ofTinyML.</description><author>Shvetank Prakash, Matthew Stewart, Colby Banbury, Mark Mazumder, Pete Warden, Brian Plancher, Vijay Janapa Reddi</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 18:54:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11899v2</guid></item><item><title>North Sámi Dialect Identification with Self-supervised Speech Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11864v1</link><description>The North S\'{a}mi (NS) language encapsulates four primary dialectal variantsthat are related but that also have differences in their phonology, morphology,and vocabulary. The unique geopolitical location of NS speakers means that inmany cases they are bilingual in S\'{a}mi as well as in the dominant statelanguage: Norwegian, Swedish, or Finnish. This enables us to study the NSvariants both with respect to the spoken state language and their acousticcharacteristics. In this paper, we investigate an extensive set of acousticfeatures, including MFCCs and prosodic features, as well as state-of-the-artself-supervised representations, namely, XLS-R, WavLM, and HuBERT, for theautomatic detection of the four NS variants. In addition, we examine how themajority state language is reflected in the dialects. Our results show that NSdialects are influenced by the state language and that the four dialects areseparable, reaching high classification accuracy, especially with the XLS-Rmodel.</description><author>Sofoklis Kakouros, Katri Hiovain-Asikainen</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 18:53:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11864v1</guid></item><item><title>Scaling laws for language encoding models in fMRI</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11863v1</link><description>Representations from transformer-based unidirectional language models areknown to be effective at predicting brain responses to natural language.However, most studies comparing language models to brains have used GPT-2 orsimilarly sized language models. Here we tested whether larger open-sourcemodels such as those from the OPT and LLaMA families are better at predictingbrain responses recorded using fMRI. Mirroring scaling results from othercontexts, we found that brain prediction performance scales log-linearly withmodel size from 125M to 30B parameter models, with ~15% increased encodingperformance as measured by correlation with a held-out test set across 3subjects. Similar log-linear behavior was observed when scaling the size of thefMRI training set. We also characterized scaling for acoustic encoding modelsthat use HuBERT, WavLM, and Whisper, and we found comparable improvements withmodel size. A noise ceiling analysis of these large, high-performance encodingmodels showed that performance is nearing the theoretical maximum for brainareas such as the precuneus and higher auditory cortex. These results suggestthat increasing scale in both models and data will yield incredibly effectivemodels of language processing in the brain, enabling better scientificunderstanding as well as applications such as decoding.</description><author>Richard Antonello, Aditya Vaidya, Alexander G.

Although previous studies have made significant contributions tothe development of methods and datasets, few papers have investigatedbenchmarks or baselines that others can easily refer to. For instance, weobserved notable variations in the reported accuracies of the sameConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) model across different studies, yet nopublic implementation exists to reproduce these results. In this paper, weestablish a benchmark for WBC recognition. Our results indicate that CNN-basedmodels achieve high accuracy when trained and tested under similar imagingconditions. However, their performance drops significantly when tested underdifferent conditions. Moreover, the ResNet classifier, which has been widelyemployed in previous work, exhibits an unreasonably poor generalization abilityunder domain shifts due to batch normalization. We investigate this issue andsuggest some alternative normalization techniques that can mitigate it. We makefully-reproducible code publiclyavailable\footnote{\url{https://github.com/apple2373/wbc-benchmark}}.</description><author>Satoshi Tsutsui, Zhengyang Su, Bihan Wen</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 18:52:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01777v2</guid></item><item><title>Reducing Sequence Length by Predicting Edit Operations with Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11862v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance invarious tasks and gained significant attention. LLMs are also used for localsequence transduction tasks, including grammatical error correction (GEC) andformality style transfer, where most tokens in a source text are keptunchanged. However, it is inefficient to generate all target tokens because aprediction error of a target token may cause a catastrophe in predictingsubsequent tokens and because the computational cost grows quadratically withthe target sequence length. This paper proposes to predict a set of editoperations for the source text for local sequence transduction tasks.Representing an edit operation with a span of the source text and changedtokens, we can reduce the length of the target sequence and thus thecomputational cost for inference. We apply instruction tuning for LLMs on thesupervision data of edit operations. Experiments show that the proposed methodachieves comparable performance to the baseline in four tasks, paraphrasing,formality style transfer, GEC, and text simplification, despite reducing thelength of the target text by as small as 21\%. Furthermore, we report that theinstruction tuning with the proposed method achieved the state-of-the-artperformance in the four tasks.</description><author>Masahiro Kaneko, Naoaki Okazaki</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 18:51:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11862v1</guid></item><item><title>Let's Sample Step by Step: Adaptive-Consistency for Efficient Reasoning with LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11860v1</link><description>A popular approach for improving the correctness of output from largelanguage models (LLMs) is Self-Consistency - poll the LLM multiple times andoutput the most frequent solution. Existing Self-Consistency techniques alwaysdraw a constant number of samples per question, where a better approach will beto non-uniformly distribute the available budget based on the amount ofagreement in the samples drawn so far. In response, we introduceAdaptive-Consistency, a cost-efficient, model-agnostic technique thatdynamically adjusts the number of samples per question using a lightweightstopping criterion. Our experiments over 13 datasets and two LLMs demonstratethat Adaptive-Consistency reduces sample budget by up to 6.0 times with anaverage accuracy drop of less than 0.1%.</description><author>Pranjal Aggarwal, Aman Madaan, Yiming Yang, Mausam</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 18:49:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11860v1</guid></item><item><title>Complex Claim Verification with Evidence Retrieved in the Wild</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11859v1</link><description>Evidence retrieval is a core part of automatic fact-checking. Prior workmakes simplifying assumptions in retrieval that depart from real-world usecases: either no access to evidence, access to evidence curated by a humanfact-checker, or access to evidence available long after the claim has beenmade. In this work, we present the first fully automated pipeline to checkreal-world claims by retrieving raw evidence from the web. We restrict ourretriever to only search documents available prior to the claim's making,modeling the realistic scenario where an emerging claim needs to be checked.Our pipeline includes five components: claim decomposition, raw documentretrieval, fine-grained evidence retrieval, claim-focused summarization, andveracity judgment. We conduct experiments on complex political claims in theClaimDecomp dataset and show that the aggregated evidence produced by ourpipeline improves veracity judgments. Human evaluation finds the evidencesummary produced by our system is reliable (it does not hallucinateinformation) and relevant to answering key questions about a claim, suggestingthat it can assist fact-checkers even when it cannot surface a completeevidence set.</description><author>Jifan Chen, Grace Kim, Aniruddh Sriram, Greg Durrett, Eunsol Choi</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 18:49:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11859v1</guid></item><item><title>Q-malizing flow and infinitesimal density ratio estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11857v1</link><description>Continuous normalizing flows are widely used in generative tasks, where aflow network transports from a data distribution $P$ to a normal distribution.A flow model that can transport from $P$ to an arbitrary $Q$, where both $P$and $Q$ are accessible via finite samples, would be of various applicationinterests, particularly in the recently developed telescoping density ratioestimation (DRE) which calls for the construction of intermediate densities tobridge between $P$ and $Q$. In this work, we propose such a ``Q-malizing flow''by a neural-ODE model which is trained to transport invertibly from $P$ to $Q$(and vice versa) from empirical samples and is regularized by minimizing thetransport cost. The trained flow model allows us to perform infinitesimal DREalong the time-parametrized $\log$-density by training an additionalcontinuous-time flow network using classification loss, which estimates thetime-partial derivative of the $\log$-density. Integrating the time-scorenetwork along time provides a telescopic DRE between $P$ and $Q$ that is morestable than a one-step DRE. The effectiveness of the proposed model isempirically demonstrated on mutual information estimation from high-dimensionaldata and energy-based generative models of image data.</description><author>Chen Xu, Xiuyuan Cheng, Yao Xie</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 18:48:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11857v1</guid></item><item><title>Video Killed the HD-Map: Predicting Driving Behavior Directly From Drone Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11856v1</link><description>The development of algorithms that learn behavioral driving models usinghuman demonstrations has led to increasingly realistic simulations. In general,such models learn to jointly predict trajectories for all controlled agents byexploiting road context information such as drivable lanes obtained frommanually annotated high-definition (HD) maps. Recent studies show that thesemodels can greatly benefit from increasing the amount of human data availablefor training. However, the manual annotation of HD maps which is necessary forevery new location puts a bottleneck on efficiently scaling up human trafficdatasets. We propose a drone birdview image-based map (DBM) representation thatrequires minimal annotation and provides rich road context information. Weevaluate multi-agent trajectory prediction using the DBM by incorporating itinto a differentiable driving simulator as an image-texture-baseddifferentiable rendering module. Our results demonstrate competitivemulti-agent trajectory prediction performance when using our DBM representationas compared to models trained with rasterized HD maps.</description><author>Yunpeng Liu, Vasileios Lioutas, Jonathan Wilder Lavington, Matthew Niedoba, Justice Sefas, Setareh Dabiri, Dylan Green, Xiaoxuan Liang, Berend Zwartsenberg, Adam Ścibior, Frank Wood</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 18:48:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11856v1</guid></item><item><title>Multimodal Web Navigation with Instruction-Finetuned Foundation Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11854v1</link><description>The progress of autonomous web navigation has been hindered by the dependenceon billions of exploratory interactions via online reinforcement learning, anddomain-specific model designs that make it difficult to leverage generalizationfrom rich out-of-domain data. In this work, we study data-driven offlinetraining for web agents with vision-language foundation models. We propose aninstruction-following multimodal agent, WebGUM, that observes both webpagescreenshots and HTML pages and outputs web navigation actions, such as clickand type. WebGUM is trained by jointly finetuning an instruction-finetunedlanguage model and a vision transformer on a large corpus of demonstrations. Weempirically demonstrate this recipe improves the agent's ability of groundedvisual perception, HTML comprehension and multi-step reasoning, outperformingprior works by a significant margin. On the MiniWoB benchmark, we improve overthe previous best offline methods by more than 31.9%, being close to reachingonline-finetuned SoTA. On the WebShop benchmark, our 3-billion-parameter modelachieves superior performance to the existing SoTA, PaLM-540B.

Yet, their capabilities for HTML understanding --i.e., parsing the raw HTML of a webpage, with applications to automation ofweb-based tasks, crawling, and browser-assisted retrieval -- have not beenfully explored. We contribute HTML understanding models (fine-tuned LLMs) andan in-depth analysis of their capabilities under three tasks: (i) SemanticClassification of HTML elements, (ii) Description Generation for HTML inputs,and (iii) Autonomous Web Navigation of HTML pages. While previous work hasdeveloped dedicated architectures and training procedures for HTMLunderstanding, we show that LLMs pretrained on standard natural languagecorpora transfer remarkably well to HTML understanding tasks. For instance,fine-tuned LLMs are 12% more accurate at semantic classification compared tomodels trained exclusively on the task dataset. Moreover, when fine-tuned ondata from the MiniWoB benchmark, LLMs successfully complete 50% more tasksusing 192x less data compared to the previous best supervised model. Out of theLLMs we evaluate, we show evidence that T5-based models are ideal due to theirbidirectional encoder-decoder architecture.

Although many differentapproaches have been proposed to improve the effectiveness of generativeretrieval, they have only been evaluated on document corpora on the order of100k in size. We conduct the first empirical study of generative retrievaltechniques across various corpus scales, ultimately scaling up to the entire MSMARCO passage ranking task with a corpus of 8.8M passages and evaluating modelsizes up to 11B parameters. We uncover several findings about scalinggenerative retrieval to millions of passages; notably, the central importanceof using synthetic queries as document representations during indexing, theineffectiveness of existing proposed architecture modifications when accountingfor compute cost, and the limits of naively scaling model parameters withrespect to retrieval performance. While we find that generative retrieval iscompetitive with state-of-the-art dual encoders on small corpora, scaling tomillions of passages remains an important and unsolved challenge.

Usually, uncorrelated noiseis used in such perturbed gradient descent (PGD) methods. It is, however, notknown if this is optimal or whether other types of noise could provide bettergeneralization performance. In this paper, we zoom in on the problem ofcorrelating the perturbations of consecutive PGD steps. We consider a varietyof objective functions for which we find that GD with anticorrelatedperturbations ("Anti-PGD") generalizes significantly better than GD andstandard (uncorrelated) PGD. To support these experimental findings, we alsoderive a theoretical analysis that demonstrates that Anti-PGD moves to widerminima, while GD and PGD remain stuck in suboptimal regions or even diverge.This new connection between anticorrelated noise and generalization opens thefield to novel ways to exploit noise for training machine learning models.</description><author>Antonio Orvieto, Hans Kersting, Frank Proske, Francis Bach, Aurelien Lucchi</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 18:26:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02831v3</guid></item><item><title>Comparing Software Developers with ChatGPT: An Empirical Investigation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11837v1</link><description>The advent of automation in particular Software Engineering (SE) tasks hastransitioned from theory to reality.

The training problem is known to beexistsR-complete with respect to linear activation functions and the ReLUactivation function. We consider the complexity of the problem with respect tothe sigmoid activation function and other effectively continuous functions. Weshow that these training problems are polynomial-time many-one bireducible tothe existential theory of the reals extended with the corresponding activationfunctions. In particular, we establish that the sigmoid activation functionleads to the existential theory of the reals with the exponential function.

In contrast, weobtain that the training problem is undecidable if sinusoidal activationfunctions are considered.

However, thesemodels use a large number of parameters, the smallest version of which has 95million parameters. This constitutes a challenge for edge AI devicedeployments. In this paper, we investigate the application of knowledgedistillation to speech representation learning (SRL) models followed by jointfine-tuning with multiple downstream voice-activated tasks. In our experimentson two such tasks, our approach results in nearly 75% reduction in model sizewhile suffering only 0.1% accuracy and 0.9% equal error rate degradationcompared to the full-size model. In addition, we show that fine-tuning the SRLmodels results in a significant performance boost compared to using frozen SRLmodels.</description><author>Mine Kerpicci, Van Nguyen, Shuhua Zhang, Erik Visser</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 18:16:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16611v2</guid></item><item><title>Improving Multimodal Joint Variational Autoencoders through Normalizing Flows and Correlation Analysis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11832v1</link><description>We propose a new multimodal variational autoencoder that enables to generatefrom the joint distribution and conditionally to any number of complexmodalities.

But producing such reviews is onerous andtime-consuming. Thus, high-quality evidence synopses are not available for manyquestions and may be outdated even when they are available. Large languagemodels (LLMs) are now capable of generating long-form texts, suggesting thetantalizing possibility of automatically generating literature reviews ondemand. However, LLMs sometimes generate inaccurate (and potentiallymisleading) texts by hallucinating or omitting important information. In thehealthcare context, this may render LLMs unusable at best and dangerous atworst. Most discussion surrounding the benefits and risks of LLMs have beendivorced from specific applications. In this work, we seek to qualitativelycharacterize the potential utility and risks of LLMs for assisting inproduction of medical evidence reviews. We conducted 16 semi-structuredinterviews with international experts in systematic reviews, groundingdiscussion in the context of generating evidence reviews. Domain expertsindicated that LLMs could aid writing reviews, as a tool for drafting orcreating plain language summaries, generating templates or suggestions,distilling information, crosschecking, and synthesizing or interpreting textinputs. But they also identified issues with model outputs and expressedconcerns about potential downstream harms of confidently composed butinaccurate LLM outputs which might mislead. Other anticipated potentialdownstream harms included lessened accountability and proliferation ofautomatically generated reviews that might be of low quality. Informed by thisqualitative analysis, we identify criteria for rigorous evaluation ofbiomedical LLMs aligned with domain expert views.</description><author>Hye Sun Yun, Iain J.

Recent advances in the field of Multi-agent reinforcementlearning (MARL) have made it feasible to study the equilibrium of complexenvironments where multiple agents learn simultaneously. However, most ABMframeworks are not RL-native, in that they do not offer concepts and interfacesthat are compatible with the use of MARL to learn agent behaviours. In thispaper, we introduce a new open-source framework, Phantom, to bridge the gapbetween ABM and MARL. Phantom is an RL-driven framework for agent-basedmodelling of complex multi-agent systems including, but not limited to economicsystems and markets. The framework aims to provide the tools to simplify theABM specification in a MARL-compatible way - including features to encodedynamic partial observability, agent utility functions, heterogeneity in agentpreferences or types, and constraints on the order in which agents can act(e.g. Stackelberg games, or more complex turn-taking environments). In thispaper, we present these features, their design rationale and present two newenvironments leveraging the framework.</description><author>Leo Ardon, Jared Vann, Deepeka Garg, Tom Spooner, Sumitra Ganesh</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 18:02:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06012v3</guid></item><item><title>Differentiable Model Selection for Ensemble Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00251v2</link><description>Model selection is a strategy aimed at creating accurate and robust models.

To mitigate this, existing methods incorporate the extra cue as aguidance for image completion. Despite improvements, these approaches are oftenrestricted to employing a single modality (e.g., segmentation or sketch maps),which lacks scalability in leveraging multi-modality for more plausiblecompletion. In this paper, we propose a novel, simple yet effective method forMulti-modal Guided Image Completion, dubbed MaGIC, which not only supports awide range of single modality as the guidance (e.g., text, canny edge, sketch,segmentation, reference image, depth, and pose), but also adapts to arbitrarilycustomized combination of these modalities (i.e., arbitrary multi-modality) forimage completion. For building MaGIC, we first introduce a modality-specificconditional U-Net (MCU-Net) that injects single-modal signal into a U-Netdenoiser for single-modal guided image completion. Then, we devise a consistentmodality blending (CMB) method to leverage modality signals encoded in multiplelearned MCU-Nets through gradient guidance in latent space. Our CMB istraining-free, and hence avoids the cumbersome joint re-training of differentmodalities, which is the secret of MaGIC to achieve exceptional flexibility inaccommodating new modalities for completion. Experiments show the superiorityof MaGIC over state-of-arts and its generalization to various completion tasksincluding in/out-painting and local editing.

For thispurpose, we combine and adapt leading-edge automatic text processing for anovel multilingual stance detection approach. Starting from 5.5M Twitter postspublished by 565 European news outlets in one year, beginning September 2021,plus replies, we perform a multilingual analysis of migration-related mediacoverage and associated social media interaction for Europe and selectedEuropean countries. The results of our analysis show that there is actually a reframing of thediscussion illustrated by the terminology change, e.g., from "migrant" to"refugee", often even accentuated with phrases such as "real refugees".However, concerning a stance shift in public perception, the picture is morediverse than expected. All analyzed cases show a noticeable temporal stanceshift around the start of the war in Ukraine.

It becomes thus crucial toimplement effective preventive strategies to guarantee their properfunctioning. In this paper, we address the problem of hallucination detectionin NMT by following a simple intuition: as hallucinations are detached from thesource content, they exhibit encoder-decoder attention patterns that arestatistically different from those of good quality translations. We frame thisproblem with an optimal transport formulation and propose a fully unsupervised,plug-in detector that can be used with any attention-based NMT model.Experimental results show that our detector not only outperforms all previousmodel-based detectors, but is also competitive with detectors that employ largemodels trained on millions of samples.</description><author>Nuno M.

To limit the use of suchmodels to benign applications, though, it is necessary that tools toconclusively detect whether an image has been generated synthetically or notare developed. For this reason, several detectors have been developed providingexcellent performance in computer vision applications, however, they can not beapplied as they are to multispectral satellite images, and hence new modelsmust be trained. In general, two-class classifiers can achieve very gooddetection accuracies, however they are not able to generalise to image domainsand generative models architectures different than those used during training.For this reason, in this paper, we propose a one-class classifier based onVector Quantized Variational Autoencoder 2 (VQ-VAE 2) features to overcome thelimitations of two-class classifiers. First, we emphasize the generalizationproblem that binary classifiers suffer from by training and testing anEfficientNet-B4 architecture on multiple multispectral datasets. Then we showthat, since the VQ-VAE 2 based classifier is trained only on pristine images,it is able to detect images belonging to different domains and generated byarchitectures that have not been used during training.

However, conventional NER DA methods are mostlyaimed at sequence labeling models, i.e., token-level classification, and feware compatible with unified autoregressive generation frameworks, which canhandle a wider range of NER tasks, such as nested NER. Furthermore, thesegeneration frameworks have a strong assumption that the entities will appear inthe target sequence with the same left-to-right order as the source sequence.In this paper, we claim that there is no need to keep this strict order, andmore diversified but reasonable target entity sequences can be provided duringthe training stage as a novel DA method. Nevertheless, a naive mixture ofaugmented data can confuse the model since one source sequence will then bepaired with different target sequences. Therefore, we propose a simple buteffective Prompt Ordering based Data Augmentation (PODA) method to improve thetraining of unified autoregressive generation frameworks under few-shot NERscenarios.

Giventhe inherent ambiguity present in natural language, it is intuitive to considerthe possible advantages of prompting with less ambiguous prompt styles, such asthe use of pseudo-code. In this paper we explore if prompting via pseudo-code instructions helpsimprove the performance of pre-trained language models. We manually create adataset of pseudo-code prompts for 132 different tasks spanning classification,QA and generative language tasks, sourced from the Super-NaturalInstructionsdataset. Using these prompts along with their counterparts in natural language,we study their performance on two LLM families - BLOOM and CodeGen.

This paper studies the convergence andimplicit bias of constant-stepsize GD for logistic regression on linearlyseparable data in the EoS regime. Despite the presence of local oscillations,we prove that the logistic loss can be minimized by GD with any constantstepsize over a long time scale. Furthermore, we prove that with any constantstepsize, the GD iterates tend to infinity when projected to a max-margindirection (the hard-margin SVM direction) and converge to a fixed vector thatminimizes a strongly convex potential when projected to the orthogonalcomplement of the max-margin direction. In contrast, we also show that in theEoS regime, GD iterates may diverge catastrophically under the exponentialloss, highlighting the superiority of the logistic loss. These theoreticalfindings are in line with numerical simulations and complement existingtheories on the convergence and implicit bias of GD, which are only applicablewhen the stepsizes are sufficiently small.</description><author>Jingfeng Wu, Vladimir Braverman, Jason D.

In order to solve this vector-valued optimization problem,practitioners often appeal to the use of scalarization functions in order totransform the multi-objective problem into a collection of single-objectiveproblems. This set of scalarized problems can then be solved using traditionalsingle-objective optimization techniques. In this work, we formalise thisconvention into a general mathematical framework. We show how this strategyeffectively recasts the original multi-objective optimization problem into asingle-objective optimization problem defined over sets. An appropriate classof objective functions for this new problem is the R2 utility function, whichis defined as a weighted integral over the scalarized optimization problems. Weshow that this utility function is a monotone and submodular set function,which can be optimised effectively using greedy optimization algorithms. Weanalyse the performance of these greedy algorithms both theoretically andempirically. Our analysis largely focusses on Bayesian optimization, which is apopular probabilistic framework for black-box optimization.</description><author>Ben Tu, Nikolas Kantas, Robert M.

However, the neural mechanismsunderlying these computations are unclear. We combine a goal-driven modelingapproach with dense neurophysiological data and high-throughput humanbehavioral readouts to directly impinge on this question. Specifically, weconstruct and evaluate several classes of sensory-cognitive networks to predictthe future state of rich, ethologically-relevant environments, ranging fromself-supervised end-to-end models with pixel-wise or object-centric objectives,to models that future predict in the latent space of purely static image-basedor dynamic video-based pretrained foundation models. We find strongdifferentiation across these model classes in their ability to predict neuraland behavioral data both within and across diverse environments. In particular,we find that neural responses are currently best predicted by models trained topredict the future state of their environment in the latent space of pretrainedfoundation models optimized for dynamic scenes in a self-supervised manner.Notably, models that future predict in the latent space of video foundationmodels that are optimized to support a diverse range of sensorimotor tasks,reasonably match both human behavioral error patterns and neural dynamicsacross all environmental scenarios that we were able to test.

While integrating VQA and dense captioning (DC) intopre-training can address this issue, acquiring image-question-answer as well asimage-location-caption triplets is challenging and time-consuming.Additionally, publicly available datasets for VQA and dense captioning aretypically limited in scale due to manual data collection and labeling efforts.In this paper, we propose a novel method called Joint QA and DC GEneration(JADE), which utilizes a pre-trained multimodal model and easily-crawledimage-text pairs to automatically generate and filter large-scale VQA and densecaptioning datasets. We apply this method to the Conceptual Caption (CC3M)dataset to generate a new dataset called CC3M-QA-DC. Experiments show that whenused for pre-training in a multi-task manner, CC3M-QA-DC can improve theperformance with various backbones on various downstream tasks. Furthermore,our generated CC3M-QA-DC can be combined with larger image-text datasets (e.g.,CC15M) and achieve competitive results compared with models using much moredata.

In this work, weinvestigate the incorporation of 3D scene features for VSD. With an external 3Dscene extractor, we obtain the 3D objects and scene features for input images,based on which we construct a target object-centered 3D spatial scene graph(Go3D-S2G), such that we model the spatial semantics of target objects withinthe holistic 3D scenes. Besides, we propose a scene subgraph selectingmechanism, sampling topologically-diverse subgraphs from Go3D-S2G, where thediverse local structure features are navigated to yield spatially-diversifiedtext generation. Experimental results on two VSD datasets demonstrate that ourframework outperforms the baselines significantly, especially improving on thecases with complex visual spatial relations.

In contrast to priorwork on testable learning, our tester is not tailored to any single targetdistribution but rather succeeds for an entire target class of distributions.The class of Poincar\'e distributions includes all strongly log-concavedistributions, and, assuming the Kannan--L\'{o}vasz--Simonovits (KLS)conjecture, includes all log-concave distributions. In the special case wherethe label noise is known to be Massart, our tester-learner achieves error$\mathrm{opt} + \epsilon$ while accepting all log-concave distributionsunconditionally (without assuming KLS).

Yet, monitoring plankton atappropriate scales still remains a challenge, limiting our understanding offunctioning of aquatic systems and their response to changes. Modern planktonimaging instruments can be utilized to sample at high frequencies, enablingnovel possibilities to study plankton populations. However, manual analysis ofthe data is costly, time consuming and expert based, making such approachunsuitable for large-scale application and urging for automatic solutions. Thekey problem related to the utilization of plankton datasets through imageanalysis is plankton recognition. Despite the large amount of research done,automatic methods have not been widely adopted for operational use. In thispaper, a comprehensive survey on existing solutions for automatic planktonrecognition is presented. First, we identify the most notable challenges thatthat make the development of plankton recognition systems difficult. Then, weprovide a detailed description of solutions for these challenges proposed inplankton recognition literature. Finally, we propose a workflow to identify thespecific challenges in new datasets and the recommended approaches to addressthem. For many of the challenges, applicable solutions exist. However,important challenges remain unsolved: 1) the domain shift between the datasetshindering the development of a general plankton recognition system that wouldwork across different imaging instruments, 2) the difficulty to identify andprocess the images of previously unseen classes, and 3) the uncertainty inexpert annotations that affects the training of the machine learning models forrecognition. These challenges should be addressed in the future research.</description><author>Tuomas Eerola, Daniel Batrakhanov, Nastaran Vatankhah Barazandeh, Kaisa Kraft, Lumi Haraguchi, Lasse Lensu, Sanna Suikkanen, Jukka Seppälä, Timo Tamminen, Heikki Kälviäinen</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 16:20:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11739v1</guid></item><item><title>CRITIC: Large Language Models Can Self-Correct with Tool-Interactive Critiquing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11738v1</link><description>Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have been impressive.However, these models sometimes show inconsistencies and problematic behavior,such as hallucinating facts, generating flawed code, or creating offensive andtoxic content. Unlike these models, humans typically utilize external tools tocross-check and refine their initial content, like using a search engine forfact-checking, or a code interpreter for debugging. Inspired by thisobservation, we introduce a framework called CRITIC that allows LLMs, which areessentially "black boxes" to validate and progressively amend their own outputsin a manner similar to human interaction with tools. More specifically,starting with an initial output, CRITIC interacts with appropriate tools toevaluate certain aspects of the text, and then revises the output based on thefeedback obtained during this validation process. Comprehensive evaluationsinvolving free-form question answering, mathematical program synthesis, andtoxicity reduction demonstrate that CRITIC consistently enhances theperformance of LLMs. Meanwhile, our research highlights the crucial importanceof external feedback in promoting the ongoing self-improvement of LLMs.</description><author>Zhibin Gou, Zhihong Shao, Yeyun Gong, Yelong Shen, Yujiu Yang, Nan Duan, Weizhu Chen</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 16:19:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11738v1</guid></item><item><title>TransPimLib: A Library for Efficient Transcendental Functions on Processing-in-Memory Systems</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01951v4</link><description>Processing-in-memory (PIM) promises to alleviate the data movement bottleneckin modern computing systems. However, current real-world PIM systems have theinherent disadvantage that their hardware is more constrained than inconventional processors (CPU, GPU), due to the difficulty and cost of buildingprocessing elements near or inside the memory. As a result, general-purpose PIMarchitectures support fairly limited instruction sets and struggle to executecomplex operations such as transcendental functions and other hard-to-calculateoperations (e.g., square root). These operations are particularly important forsome modern workloads, e.g., activation functions in machine learningapplications. In order to provide support for transcendental (and other hard-to-calculate)functions in general-purpose PIM systems, we present \emph{TransPimLib}, alibrary that provides CORDIC-based and LUT-based methods for trigonometricfunctions, hyperbolic functions, exponentiation, logarithm, square root, etc.We develop an implementation of TransPimLib for the UPMEM PIM architecture andperform a thorough evaluation of TransPimLib's methods in terms of performanceand accuracy, using microbenchmarks and three full workloads (Blackscholes,Sigmoid, Softmax).

We observe thatvanilla training on long-tailed data with cross-entropy loss makes theinstance-rich head classes severely squeeze the spatial distribution of thetail classes, which leads to difficulty in classifying tail class samples.Furthermore, the original cross-entropy loss can only propagate gradientshort-lively because the gradient in softmax form rapidly approaches zero asthe logit difference increases. This phenomenon is called softmax saturation.It is unfavorable for training on balanced data, but can be utilized to adjustthe validity of the samples in long-tailed data, thereby solving the distortedembedding space of long-tailed problems. To this end, this paper proposes theGaussian clouded logit adjustment by Gaussian perturbation of different classlogits with varied amplitude. We define the amplitude of perturbation as cloudsize and set relatively large cloud sizes to tail classes. The large cloud sizecan reduce the softmax saturation and thereby making tail class samples moreactive as well as enlarging the embedding space. To alleviate the bias in aclassifier, we therefore propose the class-based effective number samplingstrategy with classifier re-training. Extensive experiments on benchmarkdatasets validate the superior performance of the proposed method.

As a result, processor-centric systems (e.g., CPU, GPU)suffer from costly data movement between memory units and processing units,which consumes large amounts of energy and execution cycles. Memory-centriccomputing systems, i.e., with processing-in-memory (PIM) capabilities, canalleviate this data movement bottleneck. Our goal is to understand the potential of modern general-purpose PIMarchitectures to accelerate ML training. To do so, we (1) implement severalrepresentative classic ML algorithms (namely, linear regression, logisticregression, decision tree, K-Means clustering) on a real-world general-purposePIM architecture, (2) rigorously evaluate and characterize them in terms ofaccuracy, performance and scaling, and (3) compare to their counterpartimplementations on CPU and GPU. Our evaluation on a real memory-centriccomputing system with more than 2500 PIM cores shows that general-purpose PIMarchitectures can greatly accelerate memory-bound ML workloads, when thenecessary operations and datatypes are natively supported by PIM hardware. Forexample, our PIM implementation of decision tree is $27\times$ faster than astate-of-the-art CPU version on an 8-core Intel Xeon, and $1.34\times$ fasterthan a state-of-the-art GPU version on an NVIDIA A100. Our K-Means clusteringon PIM is $2.8\times$ and $3.2\times$ than state-of-the-art CPU and GPUversions, respectively. To our knowledge, our work is the first one to evaluate ML training on areal-world PIM architecture. We conclude with key observations, takeaways, andrecommendations that can inspire users of ML workloads, programmers of PIMarchitectures, and hardware designers &amp; architects of future memory-centriccomputing systems.</description><author>Juan Gómez-Luna, Yuxin Guo, Sylvan Brocard, Julien Legriel, Remy Cimadomo, Geraldo F.

Contrary to existing visual saliencyapproaches using only RGB frames as input, our network employs also depth as anadditional modality. The network consists of two visual streams, one for theRGB frames, and one for the depth frames. Both streams follow anencoder-decoder approach and are fused to obtain a final saliency map. Thenetwork is trained end-to-end and is evaluated in a variety of differentdatabases with eye-tracking data, containing a wide range of video content.Although the publicly available datasets do not contain depth, we estimate itusing three different state-of-the-art methods, to enable comparisons and adeeper insight. Our method outperforms in most cases state-of-the-art modelsand our RGB-only variant, which indicates that depth can be beneficial toaccurately estimating saliency in videos displayed on a 2D screen. Depth hasbeen widely used to assist salient object detection problems, where it has beenproven to be very beneficial. Our problem though differs significantly fromsalient object detection, since it is not restricted to specific salientobjects, but predicts human attention in a more general aspect.

To address the challenge of the lack of labeled histopathologicalimages in CBMIR, a customized unsupervised Convolutional Auto Encoder (CAE) wasdeveloped, extracting 200 features per image for the search engine component.UCBMIR was evaluated using widely-used numerical techniques in CBMIR, alongsidevisual evaluation and comparison with a classifier.

In this paper, we investigate non-stationary projection-freeonline learning, and choose dynamic regret and adaptive regret to measure theperformance. Specifically, we first provide a novel dynamic regret analysis foran existing projection-free method named $\text{BOGD}_\text{IP}$, and establishan $\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4}(1+P_T))$ dynamic regret bound, where $P_T$ denotes thepath-length of the comparator sequence. Then, we improve the upper bound to$\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4}(1+P_T)^{1/4})$ by running multiple $\text{BOGD}_\text{IP}$algorithms with different step sizes in parallel, and tracking the best one onthe fly. Our results are the first general-case dynamic regret bounds forprojection-free online learning, and can recover the existing$\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4})$ static regret by setting $P_T = 0$. Furthermore, wepropose a projection-free method to attain an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\tau^{3/4})$adaptive regret bound for any interval with length $\tau$, which nearly matchesthe static regret over that interval. The essential idea is to maintain a setof $\text{BOGD}_\text{IP}$ algorithms dynamically, and combine them by a metaalgorithm. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is also equipped with an$\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4}(1+P_T)^{1/4})$ dynamic regret bound.

We use a retrieverwith refinement training to solve the noisy labeling problem. Then, a hybridselector considers the linked relationships between heterogeneous data toselect the most relevant factual knowledge.

To combat that, we propose a novelframework that simultaneously implements the idea of internal-informationscreening and external-information exploiting. First, we represent thefine-grained semantic structures of the input image and text with the visualand textual scene graphs, which are further fused into a unified cross-modalgraph (CMG). Based on CMG, we perform structure refinement with the guidance ofthe graph information bottleneck principle, actively denoising theless-informative features. Next, we perform topic modeling over the input imageand text, incorporating latent multimodal topic features to enrich thecontexts.

Moreover, the fixed-lengthcoding leads to an unnatural raster-scan autoregressive generation. To addressthe problem, we propose a novel two-stage framework: (1) Dynamic-QuantizationVAE (DQ-VAE) which encodes image regions into variable-length codes based ontheir information densities for an accurate and compact code representation.(2) DQ-Transformer which thereby generates images autoregressively fromcoarse-grained (smooth regions with fewer codes) to fine-grained (detailsregions with more codes) by modeling the position and content of codes in eachgranularity alternately, through a novel stacked-transformer architecture andshared-content, non-shared position input layers designs.

Current 3Dfeature matching approaches commonly lead to numerous outlier correspondences,making outlier-robust registration techniques indispensable. Many recentstudies have adopted the branch and bound (BnB) optimization framework to solvethe correspondence-based point cloud registration problem globally anddeterministically. Nonetheless, BnB-based methods are time-consuming to searchthe entire 6-dimensional parameter space, since their computational complexityis exponential to the dimension of the solution domain. In order to enhancealgorithm efficiency, existing works attempt to decouple the 6 degrees offreedom (DOF) original problem into two 3-DOF sub-problems, thereby reducingthe dimension of the parameter space. In contrast, our proposed approachintroduces a novel pose decoupling strategy based on residual projections,effectively decomposing the raw problem into three 2-DOF rotation searchsub-problems. Subsequently, we employ a novel BnB-based search method to solvethese sub-problems, achieving efficient and deterministic registration.Furthermore, our method can be adapted to address the challenging problem ofsimultaneous pose and correspondence registration (SPCR).

In this work, we aim to learn highly separablesemantic hierarchical representations by stacking Joint Embedding Architectures(JEA) where higher-level JEAs are input with representations of lower-levelJEA. This results in a representation space that exhibits distinctsub-categories of semantic concepts (e.g., model and colour of vehicles) inhigher-level JEAs. We empirically show that representations from stacked JEAperform on a similar level as traditional JEA with comparative parameter countsand visualise the representation spaces to validate the semantic hierarchies.</description><author>Alžběta Manová, Aiden Durrant, Georgios Leontidis</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 15:25:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11701v1</guid></item><item><title>RGCVAE: Relational Graph Conditioned Variational Autoencoder for Molecule Design</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11699v1</link><description>Identifying molecules that exhibit some pre-specified properties is adifficult problem to solve.

Forinstance, one might search for "shorebirds that are not sandpipers" or"science-fiction films shot in England". To study the ability of retrievalsystems to meet such information needs, we construct QUEST, a dataset of 3357natural language queries with implicit set operations, that map to a set ofentities corresponding to Wikipedia documents. The dataset challenges models tomatch multiple constraints mentioned in queries with corresponding evidence indocuments and correctly perform various set operations. The dataset isconstructed semi-automatically using Wikipedia category names. Queries areautomatically composed from individual categories, then paraphrased and furthervalidated for naturalness and fluency by crowdworkers. Crowdworkers also assessthe relevance of entities based on their documents and highlight attribution ofquery constraints to spans of document text. We analyze several modernretrieval systems, finding that they often struggle on such queries. Queriesinvolving negation and conjunction are particularly challenging and systems arefurther challenged with combinations of these operations.</description><author>Chaitanya Malaviya, Peter Shaw, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, Kristina Toutanova</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 15:19:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11694v1</guid></item><item><title>ERNIE-Code: Beyond English-Centric Cross-lingual Pretraining for Programming Languages</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06742v2</link><description>Software engineers working with the same programming language (PL) may speakdifferent natural languages (NLs) and vice versa, erecting huge barriers tocommunication and working efficiency. Recent studies have demonstrated theeffectiveness of generative pre-training in computer programs, yet they arealways English-centric. In this work, we step towards bridging the gap betweenmultilingual NLs and multilingual PLs for large language models (LLMs). Werelease ERNIE-Code, a unified pre-trained language model for 116 NLs and 6 PLs.We employ two methods for universal cross-lingual pre-training: span-corruptionlanguage modeling that learns patterns from monolingual NL or PL; andpivot-based translation language modeling that relies on parallel data of manyNLs and PLs. Extensive results show that ERNIE-Code outperforms previousmultilingual LLMs for PL or NL across a wide range of end tasks of codeintelligence, including multilingual code-to-text, text-to-code, code-to-code,and text-to-text generation. We further show its advantage of zero-shotprompting on multilingual code summarization and text-to-text translation.

However, expert surgeons are often overloaded with clinical andacademic workloads and limit their time in answering. For this purpose, wedevelop a surgical question-answering system to facilitate robot-assistedsurgical scene and activity understanding from recorded videos. Most of theexisting VQA methods require an object detector and regions based featureextractor to extract visual features and fuse them with the embedded text ofthe question for answer generation. However, (1) surgical object detectionmodel is scarce due to smaller datasets and lack of bounding box annotation;(2) current fusion strategy of heterogeneous modalities like text and image isnaive; (3) the localized answering is missing, which is crucial in complexsurgical scenarios. In this paper, we propose Visual QuestionLocalized-Answering in Robotic Surgery (Surgical-VQLA) to localize the specificsurgical area during the answer prediction. To deal with the fusion of theheterogeneous modalities, we design gated vision-language embedding (GVLE) tobuild input patches for the Language Vision Transformer (LViT) to predict theanswer. To get localization, we add the detection head in parallel with theprediction head of the LViT. We also integrate GIoU loss to boost localizationperformance by preserving the accuracy of the question-answering model. Weannotate two datasets of VQLA by utilizing publicly available surgical videosfrom MICCAI challenges EndoVis-17 and 18. Our validation results suggest thatSurgical-VQLA can better understand the surgical scene and localize thespecific area related to the question-answering. GVLE presents an efficientlanguage-vision embedding technique by showing superior performance over theexisting benchmarks.</description><author>Long Bai, Mobarakol Islam, Lalithkumar Seenivasan, Hongliang Ren</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 15:13:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11692v1</guid></item><item><title>Sim-to-Real Segmentation in Robot-assisted Transoral Tracheal Intubation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11686v1</link><description>Robotic-assisted tracheal intubation requires the robot to distinguishanatomical features like an experienced physician using deep-learningtechniques.

We hereby consider generating a new data modalitythrough a virtual environment to assist the training process. Specifically,this work introduces a virtual dataset generated by the Simulation OpenFramework Architecture (SOFA) framework to overcome the limited availability ofactual endoscopic images. We also propose a domain adaptive Sim-to-Real methodfor oropharyngeal organ image segmentation, which employs an image blendingstrategy called IoU-Ranking Blend (IRB) and style-transfer techniques toaddress discrepancies between datasets. Experimental results demonstrate thesuperior performance of the proposed approach with domain adaptive models,improving segmentation accuracy and training stability. In the practicalapplication, the trained segmentation model holds great promise forrobot-assisted intubation surgery and intelligent surgical navigation.</description><author>Guankun Wang, Tian-Ao Ren, Jiewen Lai, Long Bai, Hongliang Ren</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 15:08:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11686v1</guid></item><item><title>Recycle-and-Distill: Universal Compression Strategy for Transformer-based Speech SSL Models with Attention Map Reusing and Masking Distillation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11685v1</link><description>Transformer-based speech self-supervised learning (SSL) models, such asHuBERT, show surprising performance in various speech processing tasks.However, huge number of parameters in speech SSL models necessitate thecompression to a more compact model for wider usage in academia or smallcompanies.

Furthermore, we propose a novel masking distillationstrategy to improve the student model's speech representation quality. Weextend the distillation loss to utilize both masked and unmasked speech framesto fully leverage the teacher model's high-quality representation.

Interpretability is also a key requirement thatneeds to accompany the used machine learning model. In this concern, often,intrinsically interpretable models are preferred to complex ones, which are inmost cases black-box models. Also, linear models are used in some high-riskfields to handle tabular data, even if performance must be sacrificed. In thispaper, we introduce Self-Reinforcement Attention (SRA), a novel attentionmechanism that provides a relevance of features as a weight vector which isused to learn an intelligible representation. This weight is then used toreinforce or reduce some components of the raw input through element-wisevector multiplication.

One of the mostsuitable areas for adopting FL is the medical domain, where patient privacymust be respected. Previous research, however, does not provide a practicalguide to applying FL in the medical domain. We propose empirical benchmarks andexperimental settings for three representative medical datasets with differentmodalities: longitudinal electronic health records, skin cancer images, andelectrocardiogram signals. The likely users of FL such as medical institutionsand IT companies can take these benchmarks as guides for adopting FL andminimize their trial and error. For each dataset, each client data is from adifferent source to preserve real-world heterogeneity. We evaluate six FLalgorithms designed for addressing data heterogeneity among clients, and ahybrid algorithm combining the strengths of two representative FL algorithms.Based on experiment results from three modalities, we discover that simple FLalgorithms tend to outperform more sophisticated ones, while the hybridalgorithm consistently shows good, if not the best performance. We also findthat a frequent global model update leads to better performance under a fixedtraining iteration budget. As the number of participating clients increases,higher cost is incurred due to increased IT administrators and GPUs, but theperformance consistently increases. We expect future users will refer to theseempirical benchmarks to design the FL experiments in the medical domainconsidering their clinical tasks and obtain stronger performance with lowercosts.</description><author>Seongjun Yang, Hyeonji Hwang, Daeyoung Kim, Radhika Dua, Jong-Yeup Kim, Eunho Yang, Edward Choi</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 15:01:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03075v5</guid></item><item><title>Probably Approximately Correct Federated Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04641v4</link><description>Federated learning (FL) is a new distributed learning paradigm, with privacy,utility, and efficiency as its primary pillars. Existing research indicatesthat it is unlikely to simultaneously attain infinitesimal privacy leakage,utility loss, and efficiency. Therefore, how to find an optimal trade-offsolution is the key consideration when designing the FL algorithm. One commonway is to cast the trade-off problem as a multi-objective optimization problem,i.e., the goal is to minimize the utility loss and efficiency reduction whileconstraining the privacy leakage not exceeding a predefined value. However,existing multi-objective optimization frameworks are very time-consuming, anddo not guarantee the existence of the Pareto frontier, this motivates us toseek a solution to transform the multi-objective problem into asingle-objective problem because it is more efficient and easier to be solved.To this end, we propose FedPAC, a unified framework that leverages PAC learningto quantify multiple objectives in terms of sample complexity, suchquantification allows us to constrain the solution space of multiple objectivesto a shared dimension, so that it can be solved with the help of asingle-objective optimization algorithm. Specifically, we provide the resultsand detailed analyses of how to quantify the utility loss, privacy leakage,privacy-utility-efficiency trade-off, as well as the cost of the attacker fromthe PAC learning perspective.</description><author>Xiaojin Zhang, Anbu Huang, Lixin Fan, Kai Chen, Qiang Yang</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 15:00:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04641v4</guid></item><item><title>Probabilistic Lexicase Selection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11681v1</link><description>Lexicase selection is a widely used parent selection algorithm in geneticprogramming, known for its success in various task domains such as programsynthesis, symbolic regression, and machine learning. Due to its non-parametricand recursive nature, calculating the probability of each individual beingselected by lexicase selection has been proven to be an NP-hard problem, whichdiscourages deeper theoretical understanding and practical improvements to thealgorithm. In this work, we introduce probabilistic lexicase selection(plexicase selection), a novel parent selection algorithm that efficientlyapproximates the probability distribution of lexicase selection. Our method notonly demonstrates superior problem-solving capabilities as a semantic-awareselection method, but also benefits from having a probabilistic representationof the selection process for enhanced efficiency and flexibility. Experimentsare conducted in two prevalent domains in genetic programming: programsynthesis and symbolic regression, using standard benchmarks including PSB andSRBench. The empirical results show that plexicase selection achievesstate-of-the-art problem-solving performance that is competitive to thelexicase selection, and significantly outperforms lexicase selection incomputation efficiency.</description><author>Li Ding, Edward Pantridge, Lee Spector</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 14:57:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11681v1</guid></item><item><title>Open-Set Likelihood Maximization for Few-Shot Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08390v2</link><description>We tackle the Few-Shot Open-Set Recognition (FSOSR) problem, i.e. classifyinginstances among a set of classes for which we only have a few labeled samples,while simultaneously detecting instances that do not belong to any known class.We explore the popular transductive setting, which leverages the unlabelledquery instances at inference.

Appropriate protection mechanisms have to be adopted to fulfillthe requirements in preserving \textit{privacy} and maintaining high model\textit{utility}. The nature of the widely-adopted protection mechanismsincluding \textit{Randomization Mechanism} and \textit{Compression Mechanism}is to protect privacy via distorting model parameter. We measure the utilityvia the gap between the original model parameter and the distorted modelparameter. We want to identify under what general conditions privacy-preservingfederated learning can achieve near-optimal utility via data generation andparameter distortion. To provide an avenue for achieving near-optimal utility,we present an upper bound for utility loss, which is measured using two mainterms called variance-reduction and model parameter discrepancy separately. Ouranalysis inspires the design of appropriate protection parameters for theprotection mechanisms to achieve near-optimal utility and meet the privacyrequirements simultaneously. The main techniques for the protection mechanisminclude parameter distortion and data generation, which are generic and can beapplied extensively. Furthermore, we provide an upper bound for the trade-offbetween privacy and utility, which together with the lower bound illustrated inNFL form the conditions for achieving optimal trade-off.</description><author>Xiaojin Zhang, Kai Chen, Qiang Yang</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 14:49:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04288v2</guid></item></channel></rss>
