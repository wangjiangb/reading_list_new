It is unclear, however, howthese models behave at scale, as more synthetic data is added to the trainingset. In this paper we study the scaling laws of synthetic images generated bystate of the art text-to-image models, for the training of supervised models:image classifiers with label supervision, and CLIP with language supervision.We identify several factors, including text prompts, classifier-free guidancescale, and types of text-to-image models, that significantly affect scalingbehavior. After tuning these factors, we observe that synthetic imagesdemonstrate a scaling trend similar to, but slightly less effective than, realimages in CLIP training, while they significantly underperform in scaling whentraining supervised image classifiers. Our analysis indicates that the mainreason for this underperformance is the inability of off-the-shelftext-to-image models to generate certain concepts, a limitation thatsignificantly impairs the training of image classifiers. Our findings alsosuggest that scaling synthetic data can be particularly effective in scenariossuch as: (1) when there is a limited supply of real images for a supervisedproblem (e.g., fewer than 0.5 million images in ImageNet), (2) when theevaluation dataset diverges significantly from the training data, indicatingthe out-of-distribution scenario, or (3) when synthetic data is used inconjunction with real images, as demonstrated in the training of CLIP models.</description><author>Lijie Fan, Kaifeng Chen, Dilip Krishnan, Dina Katabi, Phillip Isola, Yonglong Tian</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 18:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04567v1</guid></item><item><title>CustomNet: Zero-shot Object Customization with Variable-Viewpoints in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19784v2</link><description>Incorporating a customized object into image generation presents anattractive feature in text-to-image generation. However, existingoptimization-based and encoder-based methods are hindered by drawbacks such astime-consuming optimization, insufficient identity preservation, and aprevalent copy-pasting effect. To overcome these limitations, we introduceCustomNet, a novel object customization approach that explicitly incorporates3D novel view synthesis capabilities into the object customization process.This integration facilitates the adjustment of spatial position relationshipsand viewpoints, yielding diverse outputs while effectively preserving objectidentity. Moreover, we introduce delicate designs to enable location controland flexible background control through textual descriptions or specificuser-defined images, overcoming the limitations of existing 3D novel viewsynthesis methods. We further leverage a dataset construction pipeline that canbetter handle real-world objects and complex backgrounds. Equipped with thesedesigns, our method facilitates zero-shot object customization withouttest-time optimization, offering simultaneous control over the viewpoints,location, and background. As a result, our CustomNet ensures enhanced identitypreservation and generates diverse, harmonious outputs.</description><author>Ziyang Yuan, Mingdeng Cao, Xintao Wang, Zhongang Qi, Chun Yuan, Ying Shan</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 15:22:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19784v2</guid></item><item><title>Retrieval-Based Reconstruction For Time-series Contrastive Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00519v2</link><description>The success of self-supervised contrastive learning hinges on identifyingpositive data pairs that, when pushed together in embedding space, encodeuseful information for subsequent downstream tasks. However, in time-series,this is challenging because creating positive pairs via augmentations may breakthe original semantic meaning. We hypothesize that if we can retrieveinformation from one subsequence to successfully reconstruct anothersubsequence, then they should form a positive pair. Harnessing this intuition,we introduce our novel approach: REtrieval-BAsed Reconstruction (REBAR)contrastive learning. First, we utilize a convolutional cross-attentionarchitecture to calculate the REBAR error between two different time-series.Then, through validation experiments, we show that the REBAR error is apredictor of mutual class membership, justifying its usage as apositive/negative labeler. Finally, once integrated into a contrastive learningframework, our REBAR method can learn an embedding that achievesstate-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks across various modalities.</description><author>Maxwell A.

In this work, we investigate whether large language models(LLMs) can coherently reason about causality. Much of the existing work innatural language processing (NLP) focuses on evaluating commonsense causalreasoning in LLMs, thus failing to assess whether a model can perform causalinference in accordance with a set of well-defined formal rules. To addressthis, we propose a new NLP task, causal inference in natural language, inspiredby the "causal inference engine" postulated by Judea Pearl et al. We compose alarge dataset, CLadder, with 10K samples: based on a collection of causalgraphs and queries (associational, interventional, and counterfactual), weobtain symbolic questions and ground-truth answers, through an oracle causalinference engine. These are then translated into natural language. We evaluatemultiple LLMs on our dataset, and we introduce and evaluate a bespokechain-of-thought prompting strategy, CausalCoT. We show that our task is highlychallenging for LLMs, and we conduct an in-depth analysis to gain deeperinsight into the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our data is open-sourcedat https://huggingface.co/datasets/causalNLP/cladder, and our code can be foundat https://github.com/causalNLP/cladder.</description><author>Zhijing Jin, Yuen Chen, Felix Leeb, Luigi Gresele, Ojasv Kamal, Zhiheng Lyu, Kevin Blin, Fernando Gonzalez Adauto, Max Kleiman-Weiner, Mrinmaya Sachan, Bernhard Schölkopf</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 15:12:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04350v1</guid></item><item><title>Sudden Drops in the Loss: Syntax Acquisition, Phase Transitions, and Simplicity Bias in MLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07311v4</link><description>Most interpretability research in NLP focuses on understanding the behaviorand features of a fully trained model. However, certain insights into modelbehavior may only be accessible by observing the trajectory of the trainingprocess. We present a case study of syntax acquisition in masked languagemodels (MLMs) that demonstrates how analyzing the evolution of interpretableartifacts throughout training deepens our understanding of emergent behavior.In particular, we study Syntactic Attention Structure (SAS), a naturallyemerging property of MLMs wherein specific Transformer heads tend to focus onspecific syntactic relations. We identify a brief window in pretraining whenmodels abruptly acquire SAS, concurrent with a steep drop in loss. Thisbreakthrough precipitates the subsequent acquisition of linguisticcapabilities. We then examine the causal role of SAS by manipulating SAS duringtraining, and demonstrate that SAS is necessary for the development ofgrammatical capabilities. We further find that SAS competes with otherbeneficial traits during training, and that briefly suppressing SAS improvesmodel quality. These findings offer an interpretation of a real-world exampleof both simplicity bias and breakthrough training dynamics.</description><author>Angelica Chen, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, Kyunghyun Cho, Matthew L.

When no computational-complexitydifference is observed between binarization and unarization of instances, onthe contrary, the problems are said to be strong NP-complete. This workattempts to spotlight an issue of how the unarization of instances affects thecomputational complexity of various combinatorial problems. We present numerousNP-complete (or even NP-hard) problems, which turn out to be easily solvablewhen input integers are represented in unary. We then discuss the computationalcomplexities of such problems when taking unary-form integer inputs. We hopethat a list of such problems signifies the structural differences betweenstrong NP-completeness and non-strong NP-completeness.</description><author>Tomoyuki Yamakami</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 15:09:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04348v1</guid></item><item><title>Improved Efficient Two-Stage Denoising Diffusion Power System Measurement Recovery Against False Data Injection Attacks and Data Losses</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04346v1</link><description>Measurement uncertainties, represented by cyber-attacks and data losses,seriously degrade the quality of power system measurements. Fortunately, thepowerful generation ability of the denoising diffusion models can enable moreprecise measurement generation for power system data recovery. However, thecontrollable data generation and efficient computing methods of denoisingdiffusion models for deterministic trajectory still need further investigation.To this end, this paper proposes an improved two-stage denoising diffusionmodel (TSDM) to identify and reconstruct the measurements with variousmeasurement uncertainties. The first stage of the model comprises aclassifier-guided conditional anomaly detection component, while the secondstage involves diffusion-based measurement imputation component. Moreover, theproposed TSDM adopts precise means and optimal variances to accelerate thediffusion generation process with subsequence sampling. Extensive numericalcase studies demonstrate that the proposed TSDM can accurately recover powersystem measurements despite strong randomness under renewable energyintegration and highly nonlinear dynamics under complex cyber-physicalcontingencies. Additionally, the proposed TSDM has stronger robustness comparedto existing reconstruction networks and exhibits lower computational complexitythan general denoising diffusion models.</description><author>Jianhua Pei, Jingyu Wang, Dongyuan Shi, Ping Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 15:06:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04346v1</guid></item><item><title>Enhancing Medical Task Performance in GPT-4V: A Comprehensive Study on Prompt Engineering Strategies</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04344v1</link><description>OpenAI's latest large vision-language model (LVLM), GPT-4V(ision), has piquedconsiderable interest for its potential in medical applications.

To combat this, Integrated PestManagement (IPM) stands as a climate-smart alternative. Despite its potential,IPM faces low adoption rates due to farmers' skepticism about itseffectiveness. To address this challenge, we introduce an advanced dataanalysis framework tailored to enhance IPM adoption. Our framework provides i)robust pest population predictions across diverse environments with invariantand causal learning, ii) interpretable pest presence predictions usingtransparent models, iii) actionable advice through counterfactual explanationsfor in-season IPM interventions, iv) field-specific treatment effectestimations, and v) assessments of the effectiveness of our advice using causalinference. By incorporating these features, our framework aims to alleviateskepticism and encourage wider adoption of IPM practices among farmers.</description><author>Ilias Tsoumas, Vasileios Sitokonstantinou, Georgios Giannarakis, Evagelia Lampiri, Christos Athanassiou, Gustau Camps-Valls, Charalampos Kontoes, Ioannis Athanasiadis</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 15:05:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04343v1</guid></item><item><title>Merging by Matching Models in Task Subspaces</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04339v1</link><description>Model merging aims to cheaply combine individual task-specific models into asingle multitask model. In this work, we view past merging methods asleveraging different notions of a ''task subspace'' in which models are matchedbefore being merged. We connect the task subspace of a given model to its losslandscape and formalize how this approach to model merging can be seen assolving a linear system of equations. While past work has generally beenlimited to linear systems that have a closed-form solution, we consider usingthe conjugate gradient method to find a solution. We show that using theconjugate gradient method can outperform closed-form solutions, enables mergingvia linear systems that are otherwise intractable to solve, and flexibly allowschoosing from a wide variety of initializations and estimates for the ''tasksubspace''. We ultimately demonstrate that our merging framework called''Matching Models in their Task Subspace'' (MaTS) achieves state-of-the-artresults in multitask and intermediate-task model merging.

A mean-field model generates a comprehensive data set representingelasto-plastic behavior. In simulations, arbitrary six-dimensional strainhistories are used to predict stresses under random walking as the source taskand cyclic loading conditions as the target task.

Recent models address this byfine-tuning large text2image diffusion models on synthetic multi-view data.Despite robust zero-shot generalization, they may need post-processing and canface quality issues due to the synthetic-real domain gap. This paper introducesa novel pipeline for unsupervised training of a pose-conditioned diffusionmodel on single-category datasets. With the help of pretrained self-supervisedVision Transformers (DINOv2), we identify object poses by clustering thedataset through comparing visibility and locations of specific object parts.The pose-conditioned diffusion model, trained on pose labels, and equipped withcross-frame attention at inference time ensures cross-view consistency, that isfurther aided by our novel hard-attention guidance. Our model, MIRAGE,surpasses prior work in novel view synthesis on real images. Furthermore,MIRAGE is robust to diverse textures and geometries, as demonstrated with ourexperiments on synthetic images generated with pretrained Stable Diffusion.</description><author>Llukman Cerkezi, Aram Davtyan, Sepehr Sameni, Paolo Favaro</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 14:55:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04337v1</guid></item><item><title>Navigating News Narratives: A Media Bias Analysis Dataset</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00168v2</link><description>The proliferation of biased news narratives across various media platformshas become a prominent challenge, influencing public opinion on critical topicslike politics, health, and climate change.

While thismay appear to be a reasonable approach, we demonstrate that doing so does notcorrelate to human preference when the estimated lighting is used to relight avirtual scene into a real photograph. To study this, we design a controlledpsychophysical experiment where human observers must choose their preferenceamongst rendered scenes lit using a set of lighting estimation algorithmsselected from the recent literature, and use it to analyse how these algorithmsperform according to human perception. Then, we demonstrate that none of themost popular IQA metrics from the literature, taken individually, correctlyrepresent human perception. Finally, we show that by learning a combination ofexisting IQA metrics, we can more accurately represent human preference. Thisprovides a new perceptual framework to help evaluate future lighting estimationalgorithms.</description><author>Justine Giroux, Mohammad Reza Karimi Dastjerdi, Yannick Hold-Geoffroy, Javier Vazquez-Corral, Jean-François Lalonde</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 14:51:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04334v1</guid></item><item><title>Beyond Surface: Probing LLaMA Across Scales and Layers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04333v1</link><description>This paper presents an in-depth analysis of Large Language Models (LLMs),focusing on LLaMA, a prominent open-source foundational model in naturallanguage processing.

We unveil several key and uncommon findings based on the designedprobing tasks: (1) Horizontally, enlarging model sizes almost could notautomatically impart additional knowledge or computational prowess. Instead, itcan enhance reasoning abilities, especially in math problem solving, and helpsreduce hallucinations, but only beyond certain size thresholds; (2) In verticalanalysis, the lower layers of LLaMA lack substantial arithmetic and factualknowledge, showcasing logical thinking, multilingual and recognitive abilities,with top layers housing most computational power and real-world knowledge.</description><author>Nuo Chen, Ning Wu, Shining Liang, Ming Gong, Linjun Shou, Dongmei Zhang, Jia Li</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 14:50:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04333v1</guid></item><item><title>Surrogate Modelling for Sea Ice Concentration using Lightweight Neural Ensemble</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04330v1</link><description>The modeling and forecasting of sea ice conditions in the Arctic region areimportant tasks for ship routing, offshore oil production, and environmentalmonitoring.

Existing methods mostly adopt asimple weight in the loss function to decide the information retention of eachmodality rather than adaptively measuring complementary information fordifferent image pairs. In this study, we propose a multi-scale dual attention(MDA) framework for infrared and visible image fusion, which is designed tomeasure and integrate complementary information in both structure and lossfunction at the image and patch level. In our method, the residual downsampleblock decomposes source images into three scales first. Then, dual attentionfusion block integrates complementary information and generates a spatial andchannel attention map at each scale for feature fusion. Finally, the outputimage is reconstructed by the residual reconstruction block. Loss functionconsists of image-level, feature-level and patch-level three parts, of whichthe calculation of the image-level and patch-level two parts are based on theweights generated by the complementary information measurement. Indeed, toconstrain the pixel intensity distribution between the output and infraredimage, a style loss is added. Our fusion results perform robust and informativeacross different scenarios. Qualitative and quantitative results on twodatasets illustrate that our method is able to preserve both thermal radiationand detailed information from two modalities and achieve comparable resultscompared with the other state-of-the-art methods. Ablation experiments show theeffectiveness of our information integration architecture and adaptivelymeasure complementary information retention in the loss function.</description><author>Guang Yang, Jie Li, Hanxiao Lei, Xinbo Gao</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 14:40:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04328v1</guid></item><item><title>PromptAgent: Strategic Planning with Language Models Enables Expert-level Prompt Optimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16427v2</link><description>Highly effective, task-specific prompts are often heavily engineered byexperts to integrate detailed instructions and domain insights based on a deepunderstanding of both instincts of large language models (LLMs) and theintricacies of the target task. However, automating the generation of suchexpert-level prompts remains elusive. Existing prompt optimization methods tendto overlook the depth of domain knowledge and struggle to efficiently explorethe vast space of expert-level prompts. Addressing this, we presentPromptAgent, an optimization method that autonomously crafts prompts equivalentin quality to those handcrafted by experts. At its core, PromptAgent viewsprompt optimization as a strategic planning problem and employs a principledplanning algorithm, rooted in Monte Carlo tree search, to strategicallynavigate the expert-level prompt space. Inspired by human-like trial-and-errorexploration, PromptAgent induces precise expert-level insights and in-depthinstructions by reflecting on model errors and generating constructive errorfeedback. Such a novel framework allows the agent to iteratively examineintermediate prompts (states), refine them based on error feedbacks (actions),simulate future rewards, and search for high-reward paths leading to expertprompts. We apply PromptAgent to 12 tasks spanning three practical domains:BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), as well as domain-specific and general NLP tasks, showingit significantly outperforms strong Chain-of-Thought and recent promptoptimization baselines.

Shortening scanning times is crucial in clinicalsettings, as it increases patient comfort, decreases examination costs andimproves throughput. Recent advances in compressed sensing (CS) and deeplearning allow accelerated MRI acquisition by reconstructing high-qualityimages from undersampled data. While reconstruction algorithms have receivedmost of the focus, designing acquisition trajectories to optimizereconstruction quality remains an open question. This thesis explores twoapproaches to address this gap in the context of Cartesian MRI. First, wepropose two algorithms, lazy LBCS and stochastic LBCS, that significantlyimprove upon G\"ozc\"u et al.'s greedy learning-based CS (LBCS) approach. Thesealgorithms scale to large, clinically relevant scenarios like multi-coil 3D MRand dynamic MRI, previously inaccessible to LBCS. Additionally, we demonstratethat generative adversarial networks (GANs) can serve as a natural criterionfor adaptive sampling by leveraging variance in the measurement domain to guideacquisition. Second, we delve into the underlying structures or assumptionsthat enable mask design algorithms to perform well in practice. Our experimentsreveal that state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, whilecapable of adaptation and long-horizon planning, offer only marginalimprovements over stochastic LBCS, which is neither adaptive nor does long-termplanning. Altogether, our findings suggest that stochastic LBCS and similarmethods represent promising alternatives to deep RL. They shine in particularby their scalability and computational efficiency and could be key in thedeployment of optimized acquisition trajectories in Cartesian MRI.</description><author>Thomas Sanchez</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 14:38:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04327v1</guid></item><item><title>iDesigner: A High-Resolution and Complex-Prompt Following Text-to-Image Diffusion Model for Interior Design</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04326v1</link><description>With the open-sourcing of text-to-image models (T2I) such as stable diffusion(SD) and stable diffusion XL (SD-XL), there is an influx of models fine-tunedin specific domains based on the open-source SD model, such as in anime,character portraits, etc. However, there are few specialized models in certaindomains, such as interior design, which is attributed to the complex textualdescriptions and detailed visual elements inherent in design, alongside thenecessity for adaptable resolution.

We explore how machinelearning can accelerate this process by learning a scoring function with afunctional form that allows for more rapid optimization. Specifically, wedefine the scoring function to be the cross-correlation of multi-channel ligandand protein scalar fields parameterized by equivariant graph neural networks,enabling rapid optimization over rigid-body degrees of freedom with fastFourier transforms. The runtime of our approach can be amortized at severallevels of abstraction, and is particularly favorable for virtual screeningsettings with a common binding pocket.

Moreover, recent research has shown thatincorporating human-annotated rationales (e.g., Chain-of-Thought prompting)during in-context learning can significantly enhance the performance of thesemodels, particularly on tasks that require reasoning capabilities. However,incorporating such rationales poses challenges in terms of scalability as thisrequires a high degree of human involvement. In this work, we present a novelframework, Amplifying Model Performance by Leveraging In-Context Learning withPost Hoc Explanations (AMPLIFY), which addresses the aforementioned challengesby automating the process of rationale generation. To this end, we leveragepost hoc explanation methods which output attribution scores (explanations)capturing the influence of each of the input features on model predictions.More specifically, we construct automated natural language rationales thatembed insights from post hoc explanations to provide corrective signals toLLMs. Extensive experimentation with real-world datasets demonstrates that ourframework, AMPLIFY, leads to prediction accuracy improvements of about 10-25%over a wide range of tasks, including those where prior approaches which relyon human-annotated rationales such as Chain-of-Thought prompting fall short.Our work makes one of the first attempts at highlighting the potential of posthoc explanations as valuable tools for enhancing the effectiveness of LLMs.Furthermore, we conduct additional empirical analyses and ablation studies todemonstrate the impact of each of the components of AMPLIFY, which, in turn,leads to critical insights for refining in-context learning.</description><author>Satyapriya Krishna, Jiaqi Ma, Dylan Slack, Asma Ghandeharioun, Sameer Singh, Himabindu Lakkaraju</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 14:27:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11426v3</guid></item><item><title>How (not) to ensemble LVLMs for VQA</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06641v2</link><description>This paper studies ensembling in the era of Large Vision-Language Models(LVLMs).

Understanding this development is anessential aspect of understanding the human mind and may facilitate theconstruction of artificial minds with similar properties. Importantly, humancognitive development relies on embodied interactions with the physical andsocial environment, which is perceived via complementary sensory modalities.These interactions allow the developing mind to probe the causal structure ofthe world. This is in stark contrast to common machine learning approaches,e.g., for large language models, which are merely passively ``digesting'' largeamounts of training data, but are not in control of their sensory inputs.However, computational modeling of the kind of self-determined embodiedinteractions that lead to human intelligence and consciousness is a formidablechallenge. Here we present MIMo, an open-source multi-modal infant model forstudying early cognitive development through computer simulations. MIMo's bodyis modeled after an 18-month-old child with detailed five-fingered hands. MIMoperceives its surroundings via binocular vision, a vestibular system,proprioception, and touch perception through a full-body virtual skin, whiletwo different actuation models allow control of his body. We describe thedesign and interfaces of MIMo and provide examples illustrating its use.

However, suchunstructured caption data and its processing are troubling the learning anacurrate and complete scene graph. This dilema can be summarized as threepoints. First, traditional language parsers often fail to extract meaningfulrelationship triplets from caption data. Second, grounding unlocalized objectsin parsed triplets will meet ambiguity in visual-language alignment. Last,caption data typically are sparse and exhibit bias to partial observations ofimage content. These three issues make it hard for the model to generatecomprehensive and accurate scene graphs. To fill this gap, we propose a simpleyet effective framework, GPT4SGG, to synthesize scene graphs from holistic andregion-specific narratives. The framework discards traditional language parser,and localize objects before obtaining relationship triplets. To obtainrelationship triplets, holistic and dense region-specific narratives aregenerated from the image. With such textual representation of image data and atask-specific prompt, an LLM, particularly GPT-4, directly synthesizes a scenegraph as "pseudo labels". Experimental results showcase GPT4SGG significantlyimproves the performance of SGG models trained on image-caption data. Webelieve this pioneering work can motivate further research into mining thevisual reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</description><author>Zuyao Chen, Jinlin Wu, Zhen Lei, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Changwen Chen</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 14:11:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04314v1</guid></item><item><title>Stochastic-Constrained Stochastic Optimization with Markovian Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04312v1</link><description>This paper considers stochastic-constrained stochastic optimization where thestochastic constraint is to satisfy that the expectation of a random functionis below a certain threshold. In particular, we study the setting where datasamples are drawn from a Markov chain and thus are not independent andidentically distributed. We generalize the drift-plus-penalty framework, aprimal-dual stochastic gradient method developed for the i.i.d. case, to theMarkov chain sampling setting. We propose two variants of drift-plus-penalty;one is for the case when the mixing time of the underlying Markov chain isknown while the other is for the case of unknown mixing time. In fact, ouralgorithms apply to a more general setting of constrained online convexoptimization where the sequence of constraint functions follows a Markov chain.Both algorithms are adaptive in that the first works without knowledge of thetime horizon while the second uses AdaGrad-style algorithm parameters, which isof independent interest.

To address thisproblem, we propose the Structural-Clustering PageRank method for improvedActive learning (SPA) specifically designed for graph-structured data. SPAintegrates community detection using the SCAN algorithm with the PageRankscoring method for efficient and informative sample selection. SPA prioritizesnodes that are not only informative but also central in structure. Throughextensive experiments, SPA demonstrates higher accuracy and macro-F1 score overexisting methods across different annotation budgets and achieves significantreductions in query time. In addition, the proposed method only adds twohyperparameters, $\epsilon$ and $\mu$ in the algorithm to finely tune thebalance between structural learning and node selection.

Multi-modal LLMs empowermulti-modality understanding with the capability of semantic generation yetbring less explainability and heavier reliance on prompt contents due to theirautoregressive generative nature. While manipulating prompt formats couldimprove outputs, designing specific and precise prompts per task can bechallenging and ineffective. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novelinference method, Prompt Highlighter, which enables users to highlight specificprompt spans to interactively control the focus during generation. Motivated bythe classifier-free diffusion guidance, we form regular and unconditionalcontext pairs based on highlighted tokens, demonstrating that theautoregressive generation in models can be guided in a classifier-free way.Notably, we find that, during inference, guiding the models with highlightedtokens through the attention weights leads to more desired outputs. Ourapproach is compatible with current LLMs and VLMs, achieving impressivecustomized generation results without training.

To address this issue,we develop a novel personalized federated learning framework for heterogeneousdata, which we refer to as FedSplit. This modeling framework is motivated bythe finding that, data in different clients contain both common knowledge andpersonalized knowledge. Then the hidden elements in each neural layer can besplit into the shared and personalized groups. With this decomposition, a novelobjective function is established and optimized. We demonstrate FedSplitenjoyers a faster convergence speed than the standard federated learning methodboth theoretically and empirically. The generalization bound of the FedSplitmethod is also studied. To practically implement the proposed method on realdatasets, factor analysis is introduced to facilitate the decoupling of hiddenelements. This leads to a practically implemented model for FedSplit and wefurther refer to as FedFac.

Built upon a set of trainable tokens, each linked to distinct instances,Rein precisely refines and forwards the feature maps from each layer to thenext layer within the backbone. This process produces diverse refinements fordifferent categories within a single image. With fewer trainable parameters,Rein efficiently fine-tunes VFMs for DGSS tasks, surprisingly surpassing fullparameter fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across various settingsdemonstrate that Rein significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.Remarkably, with just an extra 1% of trainable parameters within the frozenbackbone, Rein achieves a mIoU of 68.1% on the Cityscapes, without accessingany real urban-scene datasets.</description><author>Zhixiang Wei, Lin Chen, Yi Jin, Xiaoxiao Ma, Tianle Liu, Pengyang Lin, Ben Wang, Huaian Chen, Jinjin Zheng</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 12:43:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04265v1</guid></item><item><title>Multi-agricultural Machinery Collaborative Task Assignment Based on Improved Genetic Hybrid Optimization Algorithm</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04264v1</link><description>To address the challenges of delayed scheduling information, heavy relianceon manual labour, and low operational efficiency in traditional large-scaleagricultural machinery operations, this study proposes a method formulti-agricultural machinery collaborative task assignment based on an improvedgenetic hybrid optimisation algorithm. The proposed method establishes amulti-agricultural machinery task allocation model by combining the pathpre-planning of a simulated annealing algorithm and the static task allocationof a genetic algorithm. By sequentially fusing these two algorithms, theirrespective shortcomings can be overcome, and their advantages in global andlocal search can be utilised. Consequently, the search capability of thepopulation is enhanced, leading to the discovery of more optimal solutions.Then, an adaptive crossover operator is constructed according to the taskassignment model, considering the capacity, path cost, and time of agriculturalmachinery; two-segment coding and multi-population adaptive mutation are usedto assign tasks to improve the diversity of the population and enhance theexploration ability of the population; and to improve the global optimisationability of the hybrid algorithm, a 2-Opt local optimisation operator and anCircle modification algorithm are introduced. Finally, simulation experimentswere conducted in MATLAB to evaluate the performance of the multi-agriculturalmachinery collaborative task assignment based on the improved genetic hybridalgorithm. The algorithm's capabilities were assessed through comparativeanalysis in the simulation trials. The results demonstrate that the developedhybrid algorithm can effectively reduce path costs, and the efficiency of theassignment outcomes surpasses that of the classical genetic algorithm. Thisapproach proves particularly suitable for addressing large-scale taskallocation problems.</description><author>Haohao Du</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 12:42:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04264v1</guid></item><item><title>Trends in Integration of Knowledge and Large Language Models: A Survey and Taxonomy of Methods, Benchmarks, and Applications</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05876v2</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit superior performance on various naturallanguage tasks, but they are susceptible to issues stemming from outdated dataand domain-specific limitations.

Different from the existing Riemannian gradient descent variants, theproposed approach utilizes carefully chosen subspaces that allow the update tobe written as a product of the Cholesky factor of the iterate and a sparsematrix. The resulting updates avoid the costly matrix operations like matrixexponentiation and dense matrix multiplication, which are generally required inalmost all other Riemannian optimization algorithms on SPD manifold. We furtheridentify a broad class of functions, arising in diverse applications, such askernel matrix learning, covariance estimation of Gaussian distributions,maximum likelihood parameter estimation of elliptically contoureddistributions, and parameter estimation in Gaussian mixture model problems,over which the Riemannian gradients can be calculated efficiently. The proposeduni-directional and multi-directional Riemannian subspace descent variantsincur per-iteration complexities of $\O(n)$ and $\O(n^2)$ respectively, ascompared to the $\O(n^3)$ or higher complexity incurred by all existingRiemannian gradient descent variants.

For a dialogue system to be practical and user-friendly, itshould be client-centric, focusing on the client's behaviors. However, existingdialogue systems publicly available for mental health support often concentratesolely on the counselor's strategies rather than the behaviors expressed byclients. This can lead to the implementation of unreasonable or inappropriatecounseling strategies and corresponding responses from the dialogue system. Toaddress this issue, we propose PsyChat, a client-centric dialogue system thatprovides psychological support through online chat.

They are, however, too slow in practice to track every pointobserved in a single frame in a reasonable amount of time. This paperintroduces DOT, a novel, simple and efficient method for solving this problem.It first extracts a small set of tracks from key regions at motion boundariesusing an off-the-shelf point tracking algorithm. Given source and targetframes, DOT then computes rough initial estimates of a dense flow field andvisibility mask through nearest-neighbor interpolation, before refining themusing a learnable optical flow estimator that explicitly handles occlusions andcan be trained on synthetic data with ground-truth correspondences. We showthat DOT is significantly more accurate than current optical flow techniques,outperforms sophisticated "universal" trackers like OmniMotion, and is on parwith, or better than, the best point tracking algorithms like CoTracker whilebeing at least two orders of magnitude faster.

Recent occupancy estimation techniques using only camera imagesas input can provide dense occupancy representations of large-scale scenesbased on the current observation. However, they are mostly limited torepresenting the current 3D space and do not consider the future state ofsurrounding objects along the time axis. To extend camera-only occupancyestimation into spatiotemporal prediction, we propose Cam4DOcc, a new benchmarkfor camera-only 4D occupancy forecasting, evaluating the surrounding scenechanges in a near future. We build our benchmark based on multiple publiclyavailable datasets, including nuScenes, nuScenes-Occupancy, and Lyft-Level5,which provides sequential occupancy states of general movable and staticobjects, as well as their 3D backward centripetal flow.

However, the inability to natively support non-integer arithmetic hasbeen highlighted as a major drawback in real-world applications. This featureis crucial to accurately model and manage real-world data and information asemerged in various contexts, such as the smooth movement of video gamecharacters, the 3D movement of mechanical arms, and data streamed by sensors.Nevertheless, extending ASP in this direction, without affecting itsdeclarative nature and its well-defined semantics, poses non-trivialchallenges; thus, no ASP system is able to reason natively with non-integerdomains. Indeed, the widespread floating-point arithmetic is not applicable tothe ASP case, as the reproducibility of results cannot be guaranteed and thesemantics of an ASP program would not be uniquely and declaratively determined,regardless of the employed machine or solver. To overcome such limitations andin the realm of pure ASP, this paper proposes an extension of ASP in whichnon-integers are approximated to rational numbers, fully grantingreproducibility and declarativity. We provide a well-defined semantics for theASP-Core-2 standard extended with rational numbers and an implementationthereof. We hope this work could serve as a stepping stone towards a moreexpressive and versatile ASP language that can handle a broader range ofreal-world problems.</description><author>Francesco Pacenza, Jessica Zangari</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 12:11:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04249v1</guid></item><item><title>TeMO: Towards Text-Driven 3D Stylization for Multi-Object Meshes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04248v1</link><description>Recent progress in the text-driven 3D stylization of a single object has beenconsiderably promoted by CLIP-based methods.

Parametric models of fluctuationsare difficult to fit due to complex covariance structures between degrees offreedom in the protein chain, often causing models to either violate local orglobal structural constraints. In this paper, we present a new strategy formodelling protein densities in internal coordinates, which uses constraints in3D space to induce covariance structure between the internal degrees offreedom. We illustrate the potential of the procedure by constructing avariational autoencoder with full covariance output induced by the constraintsimplied by the conditional mean in 3D, and demonstrate that our approach makesit possible to scale density models of internal coordinates to full proteinbackbones in two settings: 1) a unimodal setting for proteins exhibiting smallfluctuations and limited amounts of available data, and 2) a multimodal settingfor larger conformational changes in a high data regime.</description><author>Marloes Arts, Jes Frellsen, Wouter Boomsma</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 11:23:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13711v2</guid></item><item><title>Classical Verification of Quantum Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04843v2</link><description>Quantum data access and quantum processing can make certain classicallyintractable learning tasks feasible. However, quantum capabilities will only beavailable to a select few in the near future. Thus, reliable schemes that allowclassical clients to delegate learning to untrusted quantum servers arerequired to facilitate widespread access to quantum learning advantages.Building on a recently introduced framework of interactive proof systems forclassical machine learning, we develop a framework for classical verificationof quantum learning. We exhibit learning problems that a classical learnercannot efficiently solve on their own, but that they can efficiently andreliably solve when interacting with an untrusted quantum prover. Concretely,we consider the problems of agnostic learning parities and Fourier-sparsefunctions with respect to distributions with uniform input marginal. We proposea new quantum data access model that we call "mixture-of-superpositions"quantum examples, based on which we give efficient quantum learning algorithmsfor these tasks. Moreover, we prove that agnostic quantum parity andFourier-sparse learning can be efficiently verified by a classical verifierwith only random example or statistical query access. Finally, we showcase twogeneral scenarios in learning and verification in which quantummixture-of-superpositions examples do not lead to sample complexityimprovements over classical data. Our results demonstrate that the potentialpower of quantum data for learning tasks, while not unlimited, can be utilizedby classical agents through interaction with untrusted quantum entities.</description><author>Matthias C.

Cognitive and mathematical foundations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04219v1</link><description>Distance minimization is a general principle of language. A special case ofthis principle in the domain of word order is swap distance minimization. Thisprinciple predicts that variations from a canonical order that are reached byfewer swaps of adjacent constituents are lest costly and thus more likely. Herewe investigate the principle in the context of the triple formed by subject(S), object (O) and verb (V). We introduce the concept of word order rotationas a cognitive underpinning of that prediction. When the canonical order of alanguage is SOV, the principle predicts SOV &lt; SVO, OSV &lt; VSO, OVS &lt; VOS, inorder of increasing cognitive cost. We test the prediction in three flexibleorder SOV languages: Korean (Koreanic), Malayalam (Dravidian), and Sinhalese(Indo-European). Evidence of swap distance minimization is found in all threelanguages, but it is weaker in Sinhalese. Swap distance minimization isstronger than a preference for the canonical order in Korean and especiallyMalayalam.</description><author>Ramon Ferrer-i-Cancho, Savithry Namboodiripad</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 11:10:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04219v1</guid></item><item><title>CODEX: A Cluster-Based Method for Explainable Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04216v1</link><description>Despite the impressive feats demonstrated by Reinforcement Learning (RL),these algorithms have seen little adoption in high-risk, real-worldapplications due to current difficulties in explaining RL agent actions andbuilding user trust.

Reconstruction-basedapproaches that use generative models to learn to reconstruct healthy brainanatomy are commonly used for this task. Diffusion models are an emerging classof deep generative models that show great potential regarding reconstructionfidelity. However, they face challenges in preserving intensity characteristicsin the reconstructed images, limiting their performance in anomaly detection.To address this challenge, we propose to condition the denoising mechanism ofdiffusion models with additional information about the image to reconstructcoming from a latent representation of the noise-free input image. Thisconditioning enables high-fidelity reconstruction of healthy brain structureswhile aligning local intensity characteristics of input-reconstruction pairs.We evaluate our method's reconstruction quality, domain adaptation features andfinally segmentation performance on publicly available data sets with variouspathologies. Using our proposed conditioning mechanism we can reduce thefalse-positive predictions and enable a more precise delineation of anomalieswhich significantly enhances the anomaly detection performance compared toestablished state-of-the-art approaches to unsupervised anomaly detection inbrain MRI. Furthermore, our approach shows promise in domain adaptation acrossdifferent MRI acquisitions and simulated contrasts, a crucial property ofgeneral anomaly detection methods.</description><author>Finn Behrendt, Debayan Bhattacharya, Robin Mieling, Lennart Maack, Julia Krüger, Roland Opfer, Alexander Schlaefer</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 11:03:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04215v1</guid></item><item><title>Universal Segmentation at Arbitrary Granularity with Language Instruction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01623v3</link><description>This paper aims to achieve universal segmentation of arbitrary semanticlevel.

However, a single satellite image can cover only alimited area. In cases where a larger area of interest is studied, severalimages must be stitched together to create a single larger image, called amosaic, that can cover the area. Today, with the increasing number of satelliteimages available for commercial use, selecting the images to build the mosaicis challenging, especially when the user wants to optimize one or moreparameters, such as the total cost and the cloud coverage percentage in themosaic. More precisely, for this problem the input is an area of interest,several satellite images intersecting the area, a list of requirements relativeto the image and the mosaic, such as cloud coverage percentage, imageresolution, and a list of objectives to optimize. We contribute to theconstraint and mixed integer lineal programming formulation of this newproblem, which we call the \textit{satellite image mosaic selection problem},which is a multi-objective extension of the polygon cover problem.

Several works have also used CLIPfeatures for dense prediction tasks and have shown the emergence of open-setabilities. However, the contrastive objective used by these models only focuseson image-text alignment and does not incentivise image feature learning fordense prediction tasks. In this work, we introduce SILC, a novel framework forvision language pretraining. SILC improves image-text contrastive learning withthe simple addition of local-to-global correspondence learning byself-distillation. We show that distilling local image features from anexponential moving average (EMA) teacher model significantly improves modelperformance on dense predictions tasks like detection and segmentation, whilealso providing improvements on image-level tasks such as classification andretrieval. SILC models sets a new state of the art for zero-shotclassification, few shot classification, image and text retrieval, zero-shotsegmentation, and open vocabulary segmentation.

The predominant approach of fitting a large neural network and thenpruning it to a reduced size has commonly neglected shortcomings. The producedsurrogate models often will not capture the sensitivities and uncertaintiesinherent in the original model. In particular, (higher-order) derivativeinformation of such surrogates could differ drastically. Given a large enoughnetwork, we expect this derivative information to match. However, the prunedmodel will almost certainly not share this behavior. In this paper, we propose to find surrogate models by using sensitivityinformation throughout the learning and pruning process. We build on work usingInterval Adjoint Significance Analysis for pruning and combine it with therecent advancements in Sobolev Training to accurately model the originalsensitivity information in the pruned neural network based surrogate model. Weexperimentally underpin the method on an example of pricing a multidimensionalBasket option modelled through a stochastic differential equation with Brownianmotion. The proposed method is, however, not limited to the domain ofquantitative finance, which was chosen as a case study for intuitiveinterpretations of the sensitivities.

Although avoidingthe extensive labors of trimap annotation, existing methods still suffer fromtwo limitations: (1) For the single image with multiple objects, it isessential to provide extra interaction information to help determining thematting target; (2) For transparent objects, the accurate regression of alphamatte from RGB image is much more difficult compared with the opaque ones. Inthis work, we propose a Unified Interactive image Matting method, named UIM,which solves the limitations and achieves satisfying matting results for anyscenario. Specifically, UIM leverages multiple types of user interaction toavoid the ambiguity of multiple matting targets, and we compare the pros andcons of different annotation types in detail. To unify the matting performancefor transparent and opaque objects, we decouple image matting into two stages,i.e., foreground segmentation and transparency prediction. Moreover, we designa multi-scale attentive fusion module to alleviate the vagueness in theboundary region.

Whilehumans learn by both induction and deduction, the success of current AI isrooted in induction, relying on its ability to detect statistical regularitiesin task input -- an ability learnt from a vast amount of training data usingenormous computation resources. We examine the performance of such astatistical AI in a human task through the lens of four factors, including tasklearnability, statistical resource, computation resource, and learningtechniques, and then propose a three-phase visual framework to understand theevolving relation between AI and jobs. Based on this conceptual framework, wedevelop a simple economic model of competition to show the existence of aninflection point for each occupation. Before AI performance crosses theinflection point, human workers always benefit from an improvement in AIperformance, but after the inflection point, human workers become worse offwhenever such an improvement occurs. To offer empirical evidence, we firstargue that AI performance has passed the inflection point for the occupation oftranslation but not for the occupation of web development. We then study howthe launch of ChatGPT, which led to significant improvement of AI performanceon many tasks, has affected workers in these two occupations on a large onlinelabor platform. Consistent with the inflection point conjecture, we find thattranslators are negatively affected by the shock both in terms of the number ofaccepted jobs and the earnings from those jobs, while web developers arepositively affected by the very same shock. Given the potentially largedisruption of AI on employment, more studies on more occupations using datafrom different platforms are urgently needed.</description><author>Dandan Qiao, Huaxia Rui, Qian Xiong</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 10:06:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04180v1</guid></item><item><title>LIPEx-Locally Interpretable Probabilistic Explanations-To Look Beyond The True Class</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04856v2</link><description>In this work, we instantiate a novel perturbation-based multi-classexplanation framework, LIPEx (Locally Interpretable Probabilistic Explanation).We demonstrate that LIPEx not only locally replicates the probabilitydistributions output by the widely used complex classification models but alsoprovides insight into how every feature deemed to be important affects theprediction probability for each of the possible classes.

Furthermore, we find that motion monotonicityremaining after randomization also contributes to such robustness. Based onthis observation, we develop a novel defense method using temporal shuffling ofinput videos against adversarial attacks for action recognition models. Anotherobservation enabling our defense method is that adversarial perturbations onvideos are sensitive to temporal destruction. To the best of our knowledge,this is the first attempt to design a defense method without additionaltraining for 3D CNN-based video action recognition models.</description><author>Jaehui Hwang, Huan Zhang, Jun-Ho Choi, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Jong-Seok Lee</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 09:59:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07921v2</guid></item><item><title>Coherent energy and force uncertainty in deep learning force fields</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04174v1</link><description>In machine learning energy potentials for atomic systems, forces are commonlyobtained as the negative derivative of the energy function with respect toatomic positions. To quantify aleatoric uncertainty in the predicted energies,a widely used modeling approach involves predicting both a mean and variancefor each energy value. However, this model is not differentiable under theusual white noise assumption, so energy uncertainty does not naturallytranslate to force uncertainty. In this work we propose a machine learningpotential energy model in which energy and force aleatoric uncertainty arelinked through a spatially correlated noise process. We demonstrate ourapproach on an equivariant messages passing neural network potential trained onenergies and forces on two out-of-equilibrium molecular datasets. Furthermore,we also show how to obtain epistemic uncertainties in this setting based on aBayesian interpretation of deep ensemble models.</description><author>Peter Bjørn Jørgensen, Jonas Busk, Ole Winther, Mikkel N.

Existing methods address this challenge by first employing imputationmethods to complete the incomplete data and then conducting feature selectionbased on the imputed data. Since imputation and feature selection are entirelyindependent steps, the importance of features cannot be considered duringimputation. However, in real-world scenarios or datasets, different featureshave varying degrees of importance. To address this, we propose a novelincomplete data feature selection framework that considers feature importance.The framework mainly consists of two alternating iterative stages: the M-stageand the W-stage. In the M-stage, missing values are imputed based on a givenfeature importance vector and multiple initial imputation results. In theW-stage, an improved reliefF algorithm is employed to learn the featureimportance vector based on the imputed data. Specifically, the featureimportance vector obtained in the current iteration of the W-stage serves asinput for the next iteration of the M-stage. Experimental results on bothartificially generated and real incomplete datasets demonstrate that theproposed method outperforms other approaches significantly.</description><author>Cong Guo</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 09:45:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04171v1</guid></item><item><title>Open-vocabulary object 6D pose estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00690v2</link><description>We introduce the new setting of open-vocabulary object 6D pose estimation, inwhich a textual prompt is used to specify the object of interest. In contrastto existing approaches, in our setting (i) the object of interest is specifiedsolely through the textual prompt, (ii) no object model (e.g. CAD or videosequence) is required at inference, (iii) the object is imaged from twodifferent viewpoints of two different scenes, and (iv) the object was notobserved during the training phase. To operate in this setting, we introduce anovel approach that leverages a Vision-Language Model to segment the object ofinterest from two distinct scenes and to estimate its relative 6D pose. The keyof our approach is a carefully devised strategy to fuse object-levelinformation provided by the prompt with local image features, resulting in afeature space that can generalize to novel concepts. We validate our approachon a new benchmark based on two popular datasets, REAL275 and Toyota-Light,which collectively encompass 39 object instances appearing in four thousandimage pairs. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms both awell-established hand-crafted method and a recent deep learning-based baselinein estimating the relative 6D pose of objects in different scenes.

However, in this line of research, we note that less attention is paidto semantic segmentation. Existing methods heavily rely on data augmentationand memory buffer, which entail high computational resource demands whenapplying them to handle semantic segmentation that requires to preservehigh-resolution feature maps for making dense pixel-wise predictions. In orderto address this problem, we present Augmentation-free Dense ContrastiveKnowledge Distillation (Af-DCD), a new contrastive distillation learningparadigm to train compact and accurate deep neural networks for semanticsegmentation applications. Af-DCD leverages a masked feature mimickingstrategy, and formulates a novel contrastive learning loss via taking advantageof tactful feature partitions across both channel and spatial dimensions,allowing to effectively transfer dense and structured local knowledge learnt bythe teacher model to a target student model while maintaining trainingefficiency. Extensive experiments on five mainstream benchmarks with variousteacher-student network pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.For instance, the DeepLabV3-Res18|DeepLabV3-MBV2 model trained by Af-DCDreaches 77.03%|76.38% mIOU on Cityscapes dataset when choosing DeepLabV3-Res101as the teacher, setting new performance records.

A DVAE model is pre-trained on asingle-source dataset to capture the source dynamics. Then, multiple instancesof the pre-trained DVAE model are integrated into a multi-source mixture modelwith a discrete observation-to-source assignment latent variable. The posteriordistributions of both the discrete observation-to-source assignment variableand the continuous DVAE variables representing the sources content/position areestimated using a variational expectation-maximization algorithm, leading tomulti-source trajectories estimation. We illustrate the versatility of theproposed MixDVAE model on two tasks: a computer vision task, namelymulti-object tracking, and an audio processing task, namely single-channelaudio source separation. Experimental results show that the proposed methodworks well on these two tasks, and outperforms several baseline methods.</description><author>Xiaoyu Lin, Laurent Girin, Xavier Alameda-Pineda</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 09:36:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04167v1</guid></item><item><title>Improving Communication Efficiency of Federated Distillation via Accumulating Local Updates</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04166v1</link><description>As an emerging federated learning paradigm, federated distillation enablescommunication-efficient model training by transmitting only small-scaleknowledge during the learning process.

Most existing methods only considerglobal object features, ignoring spatial and semantic information of adjacentpoints. They cannot distinguish structural information well between differentobject parts, and the robustness of models is poor. To tackle these challenges,we propose an information interaction-based generative network for point cloudcompletion ($\mathbf{DualGenerator}$). It contains an adversarial generationpath and a variational generation path, which interact with each other andshare weights. DualGenerator introduces a local refinement module in generationpaths, which captures general structures from partial inputs, and then refinesshape details of the point cloud. It promotes completion in the unknown regionand makes a distinction between different parts more obvious. Moreover, wedesign DGStyleGAN to improve the generation quality further. It promotes therobustness of this network combined with fusion analysis of dual-pathcompletion results. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate thatour method is superior on MVP and Completion3D datasets. The performance willnot degrade significantly after adding noise interference or sparse sampling.</description><author>Pengcheng Shi, Haozhe Cheng, Xu Han, Yiyang Zhou, Jihua Zhu</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 09:33:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09132v2</guid></item><item><title>RDF Stream Taxonomy: Systematizing RDF Stream Types in Research and Practice</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14540v2</link><description>Over the years, RDF streaming was explored in research and practice from manyangles, resulting in a wide range of RDF stream definitions.

However, the non-stationary behavior oflightning signals can affect VLF electromagnetic signal transmission.Accurately classifying lightning signals is important for reducing interferenceand noise in VLF, thereby improving the reliability and overall performance ofnavigation systems. In recent years, the evolution of deep learning,specifically Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs), has sparked a transformationin lightning classification, surpassing traditional statistical methodologies.Existing CNN models have limitations as they overlook the diverse attributes oflightning signals across different scales and neglect the significance oftemporal sequencing in sequential signals. This study introduces an innovativemulti-scale residual transform (MRTransformer) that not only has the ability todiscern intricate fine-grained patterns while also weighing the significance ofdifferent aspects within the input lightning signal sequence. This modelperforms the attributes of the lightning signal across different scales and thelevel of accuracy reached 90% in the classification.

However, training these modelscan incur significant expenses, often requiring tens of thousands of GPUs formonths of continuous operation. Typically, this training is carried out inspecialized GPU clusters equipped with homogeneous high-speed Remote DirectMemory Access (RDMA) network interface cards (NICs). The acquisition andmaintenance of such dedicated clusters is challenging. Current LLM trainingframeworks, like Megatron-LM and Megatron-DeepSpeed, focus primarily onoptimizing training within homogeneous cluster settings. In this paper, weintroduce Holmes, a training framework for LLMs that employs thoughtfullycrafted data and model parallelism strategies over the heterogeneous NICenvironment. Our primary technical contribution lies in a novel schedulingmethod that intelligently allocates distinct computational tasklets in LLMtraining to specific groups of GPU devices based on the characteristics oftheir connected NICs. Furthermore, our proposed framework, utilizing pipelineparallel techniques, demonstrates scalability to multiple GPU clusters, even inscenarios without high-speed interconnects between nodes in distinct clusters.We conducted comprehensive experiments that involved various scenarios in theheterogeneous NIC environment. In most cases, our framework achievesperformance levels close to those achievable with homogeneous RDMA-capablenetworks (InfiniBand or RoCE), significantly exceeding training efficiencywithin the pure Ethernet environment. Additionally, we verified that ourframework outperforms other mainstream LLM frameworks under heterogeneous NICenvironment in terms of training efficiency and can be seamlessly integratedwith them.</description><author>Fei Yang, Shuang Peng, Ning Sun, Fangyu Wang, Ke Tan, Fu Wu, Jiezhong Qiu, Aimin Pan</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 09:26:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03549v2</guid></item><item><title>Unveiling Objects with SOLA: An Annotation-Free Image Search on the Object Level for Automotive Data Sets</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01860v2</link><description>Huge image data sets are the fundament for the development of the perceptionof automated driving systems. A large number of images is necessary to trainrobust neural networks that can cope with diverse situations. A sufficientlylarge data set contains challenging situations and objects. For testing theresulting functions, it is necessary that these situations and objects can befound and extracted from the data set. While it is relatively easy to record alarge amount of unlabeled data, it is far more difficult to find demandingsituations and objects. However, during the development of perception systems,it must be possible to access challenging data without having to performlengthy and time-consuming annotations. A developer must therefore be able tosearch dynamically for specific situations and objects in a data set. Thus, wedesigned a method which is based on state-of-the-art neural networks to searchfor objects with certain properties within an image. For the ease of use, thequery of this search is described using natural language. To determine the timesavings and performance gains, we evaluated our method qualitatively andquantitatively on automotive data sets.</description><author>Philipp Rigoll, Jacob Langner, Eric Sax</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 09:24:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01860v2</guid></item></channel></rss>
