In contrast, permutation based explanationsfor tabular data classifiers measure feature importance by comparing modelperformance on data before and after permuting a feature. We propose anexplanation method for image-based models that permutes interpretable conceptsacross dataset images. Given a dataset of images labeled with specific conceptslike captions, we permute a concept across examples in the text space and thengenerate images via a text-conditioned diffusion model. Feature importance isthen reflected by the change in model performance relative to unpermuted data.When applied to a set of concepts, the method generates a ranking of featureimportance. We show this approach recovers underlying model feature importanceon synthetic and real-world image classification tasks.</description><author>Sarah Jabbour, Gregory Kondas, Ella Kazerooni, Michael Sjoding, David Fouhey, Jenna Wiens</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:59:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14509v1</guid></item><item><title>Internal Consistency and Self-Feedback in Large Language Models: A Survey</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14507v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) are expected to respond accurately but oftenexhibit deficient reasoning or generate hallucinatory content. To addressthese, studies prefixed with ``Self-'' such as Self-Consistency, Self-Improve,and Self-Refine have been initiated. They share a commonality: involving LLMsevaluating and updating itself to mitigate the issues. Nonetheless, theseefforts lack a unified perspective on summarization, as existing surveyspredominantly focus on categorization without examining the motivations behindthese works. In this paper, we summarize a theoretical framework, termed InternalConsistency, which offers unified explanations for phenomena such as the lackof reasoning and the presence of hallucinations. Internal Consistency assessesthe coherence among LLMs' latent layer, decoding layer, and response layerbased on sampling methodologies. Expanding upon the Internal Consistencyframework, we introduce a streamlined yet effective theoretical frameworkcapable of mining Internal Consistency, named Self-Feedback. The Self-Feedbackframework consists of two modules: Self-Evaluation and Self-Update. Thisframework has been employed in numerous studies. We systematically classify these studies by tasks and lines of work;summarize relevant evaluation methods and benchmarks; and delve into theconcern, ``Does Self-Feedback Really Work?'' We propose several criticalviewpoints, including the ``Hourglass Evolution of Internal Consistency'',``Consistency Is (Almost) Correctness'' hypothesis, and ``The Paradox of Latentand Explicit Reasoning''. Furthermore, we outline promising directions forfuture research.

These studies generally utilize visualinstruction tuning with specialized datasets to enhance question and answer(QA) accuracy within the chart domain. However, they often neglect thefundamental discrepancy between natural image-caption pre-training data anddigital chart image-QA data, particularly in the models' capacity to extractunderlying numeric values from charts. This paper tackles this oversight byexploring the training processes necessary to improve MLLMs' comprehension ofcharts. We present three key findings: (1) Incorporating raw data values inalignment pre-training markedly improves comprehension of chart data. (2)Replacing images with their textual representation randomly during end-to-endfine-tuning transfer the language reasoning capability to chart interpretationskills. (3) Requiring the model to first extract the underlying chart data andthen answer the question in the fine-tuning can further improve the accuracy.Consequently, we introduce CHOPINLLM, an MLLM tailored for in-depth chartcomprehension. CHOPINLLM effectively interprets various types of charts,including unannotated ones, while maintaining robust reasoning abilities.Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' understanding ofdifferent chart types across various comprehension levels. Experimental resultsshow that CHOPINLLM exhibits strong performance in understanding both annotatedand unannotated charts across a wide range of types.</description><author>Wan-Cyuan Fan, Yen-Chun Chen, Mengchen Liu, Lu Yuan, Leonid Sigal</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:58:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14506v1</guid></item><item><title>T2V-CompBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Compositional Text-to-video Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14505v1</link><description>Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have advanced significantly, yet theirability to compose different objects, attributes, actions, and motions into avideo remains unexplored. Previous text-to-video benchmarks also neglect thisimportant ability for evaluation. In this work, we conduct the first systematicstudy on compositional text-to-video generation. We propose T2V-CompBench, thefirst benchmark tailored for compositional text-to-video generation.T2V-CompBench encompasses diverse aspects of compositionality, includingconsistent attribute binding, dynamic attribute binding, spatial relationships,motion binding, action binding, object interactions, and generative numeracy.We further carefully design evaluation metrics of MLLM-based metrics,detection-based metrics, and tracking-based metrics, which can better reflectthe compositional text-to-video generation quality of seven proposed categorieswith 700 text prompts. The effectiveness of the proposed metrics is verified bycorrelation with human evaluations. We also benchmark various text-to-videogenerative models and conduct in-depth analysis across different models anddifferent compositional categories. We find that compositional text-to-videogeneration is highly challenging for current models, and we hope that ourattempt will shed light on future research in this direction.</description><author>Kaiyue Sun, Kaiyi Huang, Xian Liu, Yue Wu, Zihan Xu, Zhenguo Li, Xihui Liu</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:58:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14505v1</guid></item><item><title>Nonlinear Schrödinger Network</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14504v1</link><description>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved exceptional performance acrossvarious fields by learning complex nonlinear mappings from large-scaledatasets. However, they encounter challenges such as high computational costsand limited interpretability. To address these issues, hybrid approaches thatintegrate physics with AI are gaining interest. This paper introduces a novelphysics-based AI model called the "Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network", whichtreats the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE) as a general-purposetrainable model for learning complex patterns including nonlinear mappings andmemory effects from data. Existing physics-informed machine learning methodsuse neural networks to approximate the solutions of partial differentialequations (PDEs). In contrast, our approach directly treats the PDE as atrainable model to obtain general nonlinear mappings that would otherwiserequire neural networks. As a physics-inspired approach, it offers a moreinterpretable and parameter-efficient alternative to traditional black-boxneural networks, achieving comparable or better accuracy in time seriesclassification tasks while significantly reducing the number of requiredparameters. Notably, the trained Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network isinterpretable, with all parameters having physical meanings as properties of avirtual physical system that transforms the data to a more separable space.This interpretability allows for insight into the underlying dynamics of thedata transformation process. Applications to time series forecasting have alsobeen explored. While our current implementation utilizes the NLSE, the proposedmethod of using physics equations as trainable models to learn nonlinearmappings from data is not limited to the NLSE and may be extended to othermaster equations of physics.</description><author>Yiming Zhou, Callen MacPhee, Tingyi Zhou, Bahram Jalali</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:58:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14504v1</guid></item><item><title>Catastrophic Goodhart: regularizing RLHF with KL divergence does not mitigate heavy-tailed reward misspecification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14503v1</link><description>When applying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), the rewardis learned from data and, therefore, always has some error. It is common tomitigate this by regularizing the policy with KL divergence from a base model,with the hope that balancing reward with regularization will achieve desirableoutcomes despite this reward misspecification. We show that when the rewardfunction has light-tailed error, optimal policies under less restrictive KLpenalties achieve arbitrarily high utility. However, if error is heavy-tailed,some policies obtain arbitrarily high reward despite achieving no more utilitythan the base model--a phenomenon we call catastrophic Goodhart. We adapt adiscrete optimization method to measure the tails of reward models, findingthat they are consistent with light-tailed error. However, the pervasiveness ofheavy-tailed distributions in many real-world applications indicates thatfuture sources of RL reward could have heavy-tailed error, increasing thelikelihood of reward hacking even with KL regularization.</description><author>Thomas Kwa, Drake Thomas, Adrià Garriga-Alonso</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:57:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14503v1</guid></item><item><title>M2D2M: Multi-Motion Generation from Text with Discrete Diffusion Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14502v1</link><description>We introduce the Multi-Motion Discrete Diffusion Models (M2D2M), a novelapproach for human motion generation from textual descriptions of multipleactions, utilizing the strengths of discrete diffusion models. This approachadeptly addresses the challenge of generating multi-motion sequences, ensuringseamless transitions of motions and coherence across a series of actions. Thestrength of M2D2M lies in its dynamic transition probability within thediscrete diffusion model, which adapts transition probabilities based on theproximity between motion tokens, encouraging mixing between different modes.Complemented by a two-phase sampling strategy that includes independent andjoint denoising steps, M2D2M effectively generates long-term, smooth, andcontextually coherent human motion sequences, utilizing a model trained forsingle-motion generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that M2D2Msurpasses current state-of-the-art benchmarks for motion generation from textdescriptions, showcasing its efficacy in interpreting language semantics andgenerating dynamic, realistic motions.</description><author>Seunggeun Chi, Hyung-gun Chi, Hengbo Ma, Nakul Agarwal, Faizan Siddiqui, Karthik Ramani, Kwonjoon Lee</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:57:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14502v1</guid></item><item><title>Indoor Air Quality Dataset with Activities of Daily Living in Low to Middle-income Communities</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14501v1</link><description>In recent years, indoor air pollution has posed a significant threat to oursociety, claiming over 3.2 million lives annually. Developing nations, such asIndia, are most affected since lack of knowledge, inadequate regulation, andoutdoor air pollution lead to severe daily exposure to pollutants. However,only a limited number of studies have attempted to understand how indoor airpollution affects developing countries like India. To address this gap, wepresent spatiotemporal measurements of air quality from 30 indoor sites oversix months during summer and winter seasons. The sites are geographicallylocated across four regions of type: rural, suburban, and urban, covering thetypical low to middle-income population in India. The dataset contains varioustypes of indoor environments (e.g., studio apartments, classrooms, researchlaboratories, food canteens, and residential households), and can provide thebasis for data-driven learning model research aimed at coping with uniquepollution patterns in developing countries. This unique dataset demandsadvanced data cleaning and imputation techniques for handling missing data dueto power failure or network outages during data collection. Furthermore,through a simple speech-to-text application, we provide real-time indooractivity labels annotated by occupants. Therefore, environmentalists and MLenthusiasts can utilize this dataset to understand the complex patterns of thepollutants under different indoor activities, identify recurring sources ofpollution, forecast exposure, improve floor plans and room structures of modernindoor designs, develop pollution-aware recommender systems, etc.</description><author>Prasenjit Karmakar, Swadhin Pradhan, Sandip Chakraborty</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:53:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14501v1</guid></item><item><title>Discover-then-Name: Task-Agnostic Concept Bottlenecks via Automated Concept Discovery</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14499v1</link><description>Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have recently been proposed to address the'black-box' problem of deep neural networks, by first mapping images to ahuman-understandable concept space and then linearly combining concepts forclassification. Such models typically require first coming up with a set ofconcepts relevant to the task and then aligning the representations of afeature extractor to map to these concepts. However, even with powerfulfoundational feature extractors like CLIP, there are no guarantees that thespecified concepts are detectable. In this work, we leverage recent advances inmechanistic interpretability and propose a novel CBM approach -- calledDiscover-then-Name-CBM (DN-CBM) -- that inverts the typical paradigm: insteadof pre-selecting concepts based on the downstream classification task, we usesparse autoencoders to first discover concepts learnt by the model, and thenname them and train linear probes for classification. Our concept extractionstrategy is efficient, since it is agnostic to the downstream task, and usesconcepts already known to the model. We perform a comprehensive evaluationacross multiple datasets and CLIP architectures and show that our method yieldssemantically meaningful concepts, assigns appropriate names to them that makethem easy to interpret, and yields performant and interpretable CBMs. Codeavailable at https://github.com/neuroexplicit-saar/discover-then-name.</description><author>Sukrut Rao, Sweta Mahajan, Moritz Böhle, Bernt Schiele</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:50:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14499v1</guid></item><item><title>Enhancing Layout Hotspot Detection Efficiency with YOLOv8 and PCA-Guided Augmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14498v1</link><description>In this paper, we present a YOLO-based framework for layout hotspotdetection, aiming to enhance the efficiency and performance of the design rulechecking (DRC) process. Our approach leverages the YOLOv8 vision model todetect multiple hotspots within each layout image, even when dealing with largelayout image sizes. Additionally, to enhance pattern-matching effectiveness, weintroduce a novel approach to augment the layout image using informationextracted through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The core of our proposedmethod is an algorithm that utilizes PCA to extract valuable auxiliaryinformation from the layout image. This extracted information is thenincorporated into the layout image as an additional color channel. Thisaugmentation significantly improves the accuracy of multi-hotspot detectionwhile reducing the false alarm rate of the object detection algorithm. Weevaluate the effectiveness of our framework using four datasets generated fromlayouts found in the ICCAD-2019 benchmark dataset. The results demonstrate thatour framework achieves a precision (recall) of approximately 83% (86%) whilemaintaining a false alarm rate of less than 7.4\%. Also, the studies show thatthe proposed augmentation approach could improve the detection ability ofnever-seen-before (NSB) hotspots by about 10%.</description><author>Dongyang Wu, Siyang Wang, Mehdi Kamal, Massoud Pedram</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:49:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14498v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning Collective Variables with Synthetic Data Augmentation through Physics-Inspired Geodesic Interpolation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01542v4</link><description>In molecular dynamics simulations, rare events, such as protein folding, aretypically studied using enhanced sampling techniques, most of which are basedon the definition of a collective variable (CV) along which accelerationoccurs. Obtaining an expressive CV is crucial, but often hindered by the lackof information about the particular event, e.g., the transition from unfoldedto folded conformation. We propose a simulation-free data augmentation strategyusing physics-inspired metrics to generate geodesic interpolations resemblingprotein folding transitions, thereby improving sampling efficiency without truetransition state samples. This new data can be used to improve the accuracy ofclassifier-based methods. Alternatively, a regression-based learning scheme forCV models can be adopted by leveraging the interpolation progress parameter.</description><author>Soojung Yang, Juno Nam, Johannes C. B.

Theirinference cost scales quadratically with respect to sequence length, making itexpensive for deployment in some real-world text processing applications, suchas retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Additionally, LLMs also exhibit the"distraction phenomenon", where irrelevant context in the prompt degradesoutput quality. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel RAG promptingmethodology, *superposition prompting*, which can be directly applied topre-trained transformer-based LLMs *without the need for fine-tuning*. At ahigh level, superposition prompting allows the LLM to process input documentsin parallel *prompt paths*, discarding paths once they are deemed irrelevant.We demonstrate the capability of our method to simultaneously enhance timeefficiency across a variety of question-answering benchmarks using multiplepre-trained LLMs. Furthermore, our technique significantly improves accuracywhen the retrieved context is large relative the context the model was trainedon. For example, our approach facilitates a 93x reduction in compute time while*improving* accuracy by 43% on the NaturalQuestions-Open dataset with theMPT-7B instruction-tuned model over naive RAG.</description><author>Thomas Merth, Qichen Fu, Mohammad Rastegari, Mahyar Najibi</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:47:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06910v2</guid></item><item><title>Conformal Thresholded Intervals for Efficient Regression</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14495v1</link><description>This paper introduces Conformal Thresholded Intervals (CTI), a novelconformal regression method that aims to produce the smallest possibleprediction set with guaranteed coverage. Unlike existing methods that rely onnested conformal framework and full conditional distribution estimation, CTIestimates the conditional probability density for a new response to fall intoeach interquantile interval using off-the-shelf multi-output quantileregression. CTI constructs prediction sets by thresholding the estimatedconditional interquantile intervals based on their length, which is inverselyproportional to the estimated probability density.

This work presents InterpBench, a collection ofsemi-synthetic yet realistic transformers with known circuits for evaluatingthese techniques. We train these neural networks using a stricter version ofInterchange Intervention Training (IIT) which we call Strict IIT (SIIT). Likethe original, SIIT trains neural networks by aligning their internalcomputation with a desired high-level causal model, but it also preventsnon-circuit nodes from affecting the model's output. We evaluate SIIT on sparsetransformers produced by the Tracr tool and find that SIIT models maintainTracr's original circuit while being more realistic. SIIT can also traintransformers with larger circuits, like Indirect Object Identification (IOI).Finally, we use our benchmark to evaluate existing circuit discoverytechniques.</description><author>Rohan Gupta, Iván Arcuschin, Thomas Kwa, Adrià Garriga-Alonso</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:46:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14494v1</guid></item><item><title>PD-TPE: Parallel Decoder with Text-guided Position Encoding for 3D Visual Grounding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14491v1</link><description>3D visual grounding aims to locate the target object mentioned by free-formednatural language descriptions in 3D point cloud scenes. Most previous workrequires the encoder-decoder to simultaneously align the attribute informationof the target object and its relational information with the surroundingenvironment across modalities. This causes the queries' attention to bedispersed, potentially leading to an excessive focus on points irrelevant tothe input language descriptions. To alleviate these issues, we propose PD-TPE,a visual-language model with a double-branch decoder. The two branches performproposal feature decoding and surrounding layout awareness in parallel. Sincetheir attention maps are not influenced by each other, the queries focus ontokens relevant to each branch's specific objective. In particular, we design anovel Text-guided Position Encoding method, which differs between the twobranches. In the main branch, the priori relies on the relative positionsbetween tokens and predicted 3D boxes, which direct the model to pay moreattention to tokens near the object; in the surrounding branch, it is guided bythe similarity between visual and text features, so that the queries attend totokens that can provide effective layout information.

Weevaluate two kinds of such self-explanations - extractive and counterfactual -using three state-of-the-art LLMs (2B to 8B parameters) on two differentclassification tasks (objective and subjective). Our findings reveal, that,while these self-explanations can correlate with human judgement, they do notfully and accurately follow the model's decision process, indicating a gapbetween perceived and actual model reasoning. We show that this gap can bebridged because prompting LLMs for counterfactual explanations can producefaithful, informative, and easy-to-verify results. These counterfactuals offera promising alternative to traditional explainability methods (e.g. SHAP,LIME), provided that prompts are tailored to specific tasks and checked forvalidity.</description><author>Korbinian Randl, John Pavlopoulos, Aron Henriksson, Tony Lindgren</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:41:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14487v1</guid></item><item><title>Explainable Post hoc Portfolio Management Financial Policy of a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14486v1</link><description>Financial portfolio management investment policies computed quantitatively bymodern portfolio theory techniques like the Markowitz model rely on a set onassumptions that are not supported by data in high volatility markets. Hence,quantitative researchers are looking for alternative models to tackle thisproblem. Concretely, portfolio management is a problem that has beensuccessfully addressed recently by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)approaches. In particular, DRL algorithms train an agent by estimating thedistribution of the expected reward of every action performed by an agent givenany financial state in a simulator. However, these methods rely on Deep NeuralNetworks model to represent such a distribution, that although they areuniversal approximator models, they cannot explain its behaviour, given by aset of parameters that are not interpretable. Critically, financial investorspolicies require predictions to be interpretable, so DRL agents are not suitedto follow a particular policy or explain their actions. In this work, wedeveloped a novel Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XDRL) approach forportfolio management, integrating the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) withthe model agnostic explainable techniques of feature importance, SHAP and LIMEto enhance transparency in prediction time. By executing our methodology, wecan interpret in prediction time the actions of the agent to assess whetherthey follow the requisites of an investment policy or to assess the risk offollowing the agent suggestions. To the best of our knowledge, our proposedapproach is the first explainable post hoc portfolio management financialpolicy of a DRL agent. We empirically illustrate our methodology bysuccessfully identifying key features influencing investment decisions, whichdemonstrate the ability to explain the agent actions in prediction time.</description><author>Alejandra de la Rica Escudero, Eduardo C.

Our approach involves distilling the originalViT-based SAM image encoder into a purely CNN-based architecture, better suitedfor edge devices. We carefully benchmark various distillation strategies anddemonstrate that taskagnostic encoder distillation fails to capture the fullknowledge embodied in SAM. To overcome this bottleneck, we include both theprompt encoder and mask decoder in the distillation process, with box and pointprompts in the loop, so that the distilled model can accurately capture theintricate dynamics between user input and mask generation. To mitigate datasetbias issues stemming from point prompt distillation, we incorporate alightweight module within the encoder. As a result, EdgeSAM achieves a 37-foldspeed increase compared to the original SAM, and it also outperformsMobileSAM/EfficientSAM, being over 7 times as fast when deployed on edgedevices while enhancing the mIoUs on COCO and LVIS by 2.3/1.5 and 3.1/1.6,respectively.

Moreover, competent generative capabilities of LLMs areobserved only in high-resource languages, while their performances amongunder-represented languages fall behind due to pre-training data imbalance. Toelicit LLMs' ability onto low-resource languages without any supervised data,we propose to assemble synthetic exemplars from a diverse set of high-resourcelanguages to prompt the LLMs to translate from any language into English. Theseprompts are then used to create intra-lingual exemplars to perform tasks in thetarget languages. Our unsupervised prompting method performs on par withsupervised few-shot learning in LLMs of different sizes for translationsbetween English and 13 Indic and 21 African low-resource languages. We alsoshow that fine-tuning a 7B model on data generated from our method helps itperform competitively with a 175B model. In non-English translation tasks, ourmethod even outperforms supervised prompting by up to 3 chrF++ in manylow-resource languages. When evaluated on zero-shot multilingual summarization,our method surpasses other English-pivoting baselines by up to 4 ROUGE-L and isalso favored by GPT-4.</description><author>Xuan-Phi Nguyen, Sharifah Mahani Aljunied, Shafiq Joty, Lidong Bing</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:31:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11372v2</guid></item><item><title>A review on vision-based motion estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14478v1</link><description>Compared to contact sensors-based motion measurement, vision-based motionmeasurement has advantages of low cost and high efficiency and have been underactive development in the past decades.

Whilemany studies have enhanced algorithmic techniques to optimize learning fromsuch data, this work shifts focus to improving preference learning through adata-centric approach. Specifically, we propose enriching existing preferencedatasets with machine-generated rationales that explain the reasons behindchoices. We develop a simple and principled framework to augment currentpreference learning methods with rationale information. Our comprehensiveanalysis highlights how rationales enhance learning efficiency. Extensiveexperiments reveal that rationale-enriched preference learning offers multipleadvantages: it improves data efficiency, accelerates convergence tohigher-performing models, and reduces verbosity bias and hallucination.Furthermore, this framework is versatile enough to integrate with variouspreference optimization algorithms.

Such inherent data bias canpredispose automatic report generation models to learn entangled and spuriousrepresentations resulting in misdiagnostic reports. To tackle these, we proposea novel \textbf{Co}unter\textbf{F}actual \textbf{E}xplanations-based framework(CoFE) for radiology report generation. Counterfactual explanations serve as apotent tool for understanding how decisions made by algorithms can be changedby asking ``what if'' scenarios. By leveraging this concept, CoFE can learnnon-spurious visual representations by contrasting the representations betweenfactual and counterfactual images. Specifically, we derive counterfactualimages by swapping a patch between positive and negative samples until apredicted diagnosis shift occurs. Here, positive and negative samples are themost semantically similar but have different diagnosis labels. Additionally,CoFE employs a learnable prompt to efficiently fine-tune the pre-trained largelanguage model, encapsulating both factual and counterfactual content toprovide a more generalizable prompt representation. Extensive experiments ontwo benchmarks demonstrate that leveraging the counterfactual explanationsenables CoFE to generate semantically coherent and factually complete reportsand outperform in terms of language generation and clinical efficacy metrics.</description><author>Mingjie Li, Haokun Lin, Liang Qiu, Xiaodan Liang, Ling Chen, Abdulmotaleb Elsaddik, Xiaojun Chang</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:24:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14474v1</guid></item><item><title>MLMT-CNN for Object Detection and Segmentation in Multi-layer and Multi-spectral Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14473v1</link><description>Precisely localising solar Active Regions (AR) from multi-spectral images isa challenging but important task in understanding solar activity and itsinfluence on space weather. A main challenge comes from each modality capturinga different location of the 3D objects, as opposed to typical multi-spectralimaging scenarios where all image bands observe the same scene. Thus, we referto this special multi-spectral scenario as multi-layer. We present a multi-taskdeep learning framework that exploits the dependencies between image bands toproduce 3D AR localisation (segmentation and detection) where different imagebands (and physical locations) have their own set of results. Furthermore, toaddress the difficulty of producing dense AR annotations for trainingsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, we adapt a training strategy basedon weak labels (i.e. bounding boxes) in a recursive manner. We compare ourdetection and segmentation stages against baseline approaches for solar imageanalysis (multi-channel coronal hole detection, SPOCA for ARs) andstate-of-the-art deep learning methods (Faster RCNN, U-Net). Additionally, bothdetection a nd segmentation stages are quantitatively validated on artificiallycreated data of similar spatial configurations made from annotated multi-modalmagnetic resonance images. Our framework achieves an average of 0.72 IoU(segmentation) and 0.90 F1 score (detection) across all modalities, comparingto the best performing baseline methods with scores of 0.53 and 0.58,respectively, on the artificial dataset, and 0.84 F1 score in the AR detectiontask comparing to baseline of 0.82 F1 score.

Unfortunately, these arecostly to obtain and often limited by human annotators' biases. To achieverobust generalization, it is essential to develop algorithms for automaticenvironment discovery within datasets. Current proposals, which divide examplesbased on their training error, suffer from one fundamental problem. Thesemethods introduce hyper-parameters and early-stopping criteria, which require avalidation set with human-annotated environments, the very information subjectto discovery. In this paper, we propose Cross-Risk-Minimization (XRM) toaddress this issue. XRM trains twin networks, each learning from one randomhalf of the training data, while imitating confident held-out mistakes made byits sibling. XRM provides a recipe for hyper-parameter tuning, does not requireearly-stopping, and can discover environments for all training and validationdata. Algorithms built on top of XRM environments achieve oracleworst-group-accuracy, addressing a long-standing challenge in OODgeneralization.

These MLP layers significantly increasecomputational complexity, making such models less applicable to 3D imagecontexts, where data dimensionality and computational costs are higher. In 3Dmedical imaging, such as 3D pulmonary CT scans, efficient processing is crucialdue to the large data volume. Traditional 2D attention generalized to 3Dincreases the computational load, creating demand for more efficient attentionmechanisms for 3D tasks. We investigate the possibility of incorporating fullyconvolutional (conv.) attention in 3D context. We present two 3D fully conv.attention blocks, demonstrating their effectiveness in 3D context. Usingpulmonary CT scans for 3D lung nodule detection, we present AttentNet, anautomated lung nodule detection framework from CT images, performing detectionas an ensemble of two stages, candidate proposal and false positive (FP)reduction. We compare the proposed 3D attention blocks to popular 2D conv.attention methods generalized to 3D modules and to self-attention units. Forthe FP reduction stage, we also use a joint analysis approach to aggregatespatial information from different contextual levels. We use LUNA-16 lungnodule detection dataset to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed fullyconv. attention blocks compared to baseline popular lung nodule detectionmethods when no attention is used.

However, many current methods focus on employingshared polynomial coefficients for all nodes, i.e., learning node-unifiedfilters, which limits the filters' flexibility for node-level tasks. The recentDSF attempts to overcome this limitation by learning node-wise coefficientsbased on positional encoding. However, the initialization and updating processof the positional encoding are burdensome, hindering scalability on large-scalegraphs. In this work, we propose a scalable node-wise filter, PolyAttn.Leveraging the attention mechanism, PolyAttn can directly learn node-wisefilters in an efficient manner, offering powerful representation capabilities.Building on PolyAttn, we introduce the whole model, named PolyFormer. In thelens of Graph Transformer models, PolyFormer, which calculates attention scoreswithin nodes, shows great scalability. Moreover, the model captures spectralinformation, enhancing expressiveness while maintaining efficiency. With theseadvantages, PolyFormer offers a desirable balance between scalability andexpressiveness for node-level tasks.

While previousresearch has found that the presence of a social interaction can be detectedfrom ambient audio, the nuances within social contexts, which influence howanxiety provoking interactions are, remain largely unexplored. As analternative to traditional, burdensome methods like self-report, this studypresents a novel approach that harnesses ambient audio segments to detectsocial threat contexts. We focus on two key dimensions: number of interactionpartners (dyadic vs. group) and degree of evaluative threat (explicitlyevaluative vs. not explicitly evaluative). Building on data from a Zoom-basedsocial interaction study (N=52 college students, of whom the majority N=45 aresocially anxious), we employ deep learning methods to achieve strong detectionperformance. Under sample-wide 5-fold Cross Validation (CV), our modeldistinguished dyadic from group interactions with 90\% accuracy and detectedevaluative threat at 83\%. Using a leave-one-group-out CV, accuracies were 82\%and 77\%, respectively. While our data are based on virtual interactions due topandemic constraints, our method has the potential to extend to diversereal-world settings.

The gap between brain age and chronological age, referred to asbrain PAD (Predicted Age Difference), has been utilized to investigateneurodegenerative conditions. Brain age can be predicted using MRIs and machinelearning techniques. However, existing methods are often sensitive toacquisition-related variabilities, such as differences in acquisitionprotocols, scanners, MRI sequences, and resolutions, significantly limitingtheir application in highly heterogeneous clinical settings.

We take a step towards resolving these shortcomingsby utilizing the recent state-of-the-art 3D explicit representation, GaussianSplatting, and an unconditional diffusion model. This model learns to generate3D objects represented by sets of GS ellipsoids. With these strong generative3D priors, though learning unconditionally, the diffusion model is ready forview-guided reconstruction without further model fine-tuning. This is achievedby propagating fine-grained 2D features through the efficient yet flexiblesplatting function and the guided denoising sampling process. In addition, a 2Ddiffusion model is further employed to enhance rendering fidelity, and improvereconstructed GS quality by polishing and re-using the rendered images. Thefinal reconstructed objects explicitly come with high-quality 3D structure andtexture, and can be efficiently rendered in arbitrary views.

However, high latency in these visual perception components can leadto significant safety risks, such as vehicle collisions. While previousresearch has extensively explored latency attacks within the digital realm,translating these methods effectively to the physical world presentschallenges. For instance, existing attacks rely on perturbations that areunrealistic or impractical for AD, such as adversarial perturbations affectingareas like the sky, or requiring large patches that obscure most of a camera'sview, thus making them impossible to be conducted effectively in the realworld. In this paper, we introduce SlowPerception, the first physical-world latencyattack against AD perception, via generating projector-based universalperturbations. SlowPerception strategically creates numerous phantom objects onvarious surfaces in the environment, significantly increasing the computationalload of Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and MOT, thereby inducing substantiallatency. Our SlowPerception achieves second-level latency in physical-worldsettings, with an average latency of 2.5 seconds across different AD perceptionsystems, scenarios, and hardware configurations. This performance significantlyoutperforms existing state-of-the-art latency attacks. Additionally, we conductAD system-level impact assessments, such as vehicle collisions, usingindustry-grade AD systems with production-grade AD simulators with a 97%average rate.

Most of current document understanding methods preserveall tokens within sub-images and treat them equally. This neglects theirdifferent informativeness and leads to a significant increase in the number ofimage tokens. To perform a more adaptive and efficient document understanding,we propose Token-level Correlation-guided Compression, a parameter-free andplug-and-play methodology to optimize token processing. Firstly, we propose aninnovative approach for assessing the pattern repetitiveness based on thecorrelation between each patch tokens. This method identifies redundant tokens,allowing for the determination of the sub-image's information density.Secondly, we present a token-level sampling method that efficiently capturesthe most informative tokens by delving into the correlation between the [CLS]token and patch tokens. By integrating these strategies, we develop aplug-and-play adaptive compressor module that can be seamlessly incorporatedinto MLLMs utilizing cropping techniques. This module not only enhances theprocessing speed during training and inference but also maintains comparableperformance.

Themassive collection and usage of data, however, pose an increasing risk forpeople's private and sensitive information due to either inadvertentmishandling or malicious exploitation. Besides legislative solutions, manytechnical approaches have been proposed towards data privacy protection.However, they bear various limitations such as leading to degraded dataavailability and utility, or relying on heuristics and lacking solidtheoretical bases. To overcome these limitations, we propose a formalinformation-theoretic definition for this utility-preserving privacy protectionproblem, and design a data-driven learnable data transformation framework thatis capable of selectively suppressing sensitive attributes from target datasetswhile preserving the other useful attributes, regardless of whether or not theyare known in advance or explicitly annotated for preservation. We providerigorous theoretical analyses on the operational bounds for our framework, andcarry out comprehensive experimental evaluations using datasets of a variety ofmodalities, including facial images, voice audio clips, and human activitymotion sensor signals.

To be useful for downstream tasks, SAEs need todecompose LM activations faithfully; yet to be interpretable the decompositionmust be sparse -- two objectives that are in tension. In this paper, weintroduce JumpReLU SAEs, which achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelityat a given sparsity level on Gemma 2 9B activations, compared to other recentadvances such as Gated and TopK SAEs. We also show that this improvement doesnot come at the cost of interpretability through manual and automatedinterpretability studies. JumpReLU SAEs are a simple modification of vanilla(ReLU) SAEs -- where we replace the ReLU with a discontinuous JumpReLUactivation function -- and are similarly efficient to train and run. Byutilising straight-through-estimators (STEs) in a principled manner, we showhow it is possible to train JumpReLU SAEs effectively despite the discontinuousJumpReLU function introduced in the SAE's forward pass. Similarly, we use STEsto directly train L0 to be sparse, instead of training on proxies such as L1,avoiding problems like shrinkage.</description><author>Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Tom Lieberum, Nicolas Sonnerat, Arthur Conmy, Vikrant Varma, János Kramár, Neel Nanda</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 16:07:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14435v1</guid></item><item><title>Co-synthesis of Histopathology Nuclei Image-Label Pairs using a Context-Conditioned Joint Diffusion Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14434v1</link><description>In multi-class histopathology nuclei analysis tasks, the lack of trainingdata becomes a main bottleneck for the performance of learning-based methods.To tackle this challenge, previous methods have utilized generative models toincrease data by generating synthetic samples. However, existing methods oftenoverlook the importance of considering the context of biological tissues (e.g.,shape, spatial layout, and tissue type) in the synthetic data. Moreover, whilegenerative models have shown superior performance in synthesizing realistichistopathology images, none of the existing methods are capable of producingimage-label pairs at the same time. In this paper, we introduce a novelframework for co-synthesizing histopathology nuclei images and paired semanticlabels using a context-conditioned joint diffusion model. We proposeconditioning of a diffusion model using nucleus centroid layouts withstructure-related text prompts to incorporate spatial and structural contextinformation into the generation targets. Moreover, we enhance the granularityof our synthesized semantic labels by generating instance-wise nuclei labelsusing distance maps synthesized concurrently in conjunction with the images andsemantic labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework ingenerating high-quality samples on multi-institutional, multi-organ, andmulti-modality datasets.

The aim is often to share datasets efficiently with othersites to train models effectively. One possible solution is to avoidtransferring the entire dataset while still achieving similar modelperformance. Recent progress in data distillation within computer scienceoffers promising prospects for sharing medical data efficiently withoutsignificantly compromising model effectiveness. However, it remains uncertainwhether these methods would be applicable to medical imaging, since medical andnatural images are distinct fields. Moreover, it is intriguing to consider whatlevel of performance could be achieved with these methods. To answer thesequestions, we conduct investigations on a variety of leading data distillationmethods, in different contexts of medical imaging. We evaluate the feasibilityof these methods with extensive experiments in two aspects: 1) Assess theimpact of data distillation across multiple datasets characterized by minor orgreat variations. 2) Explore the indicator to predict the distillationperformance. Our extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets revealthat data distillation can significantly reduce dataset size while maintainingcomparable model performance to that achieved with the full dataset, suggestingthat a small, representative sample of images can serve as a reliable indicatorof distillation success. This study demonstrates that data distillation is aviable method for efficient and secure medical data sharing, with the potentialto facilitate enhanced collaborative research and clinical applications.</description><author>Muyang Li, Can Cui, Quan Liu, Ruining Deng, Tianyuan Yao, Marilyn Lionts, Yuankai Huo</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 15:59:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14429v1</guid></item><item><title>From Principles to Practices: Lessons Learned from Applying Partnership on AI's (PAI) Synthetic Media Framework to 11 Use Cases</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13025v2</link><description>2023 was the year the world woke up to generative AI, and 2024 is the yearpolicymakers are responding more firmly.

Bothapproaches enable conditional sampling and conditional density estimation,which are core tasks in Bayesian inference$\unicode{x2013}$particularly in thesimulation-based ("likelihood-free") setting. Our methods represent the targetconditional distributions as transformations of a tractable referencedistribution and, therefore, fall into the framework of measure transport.Although many measure transport approaches model the transformation as COTmaps, obtaining the map is computationally challenging, even in moderatedimensions. To improve scalability, our numerical algorithms use neuralnetworks to parameterize COT maps and further exploit the structure of the COTproblem. Our static approach approximates the map as the gradient of apartially input-convex neural network. It uses a novel numerical implementationto increase computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.Our dynamic approach approximates the conditional optimal transport via theflow map of a regularized neural ODE; compared to the static approach, it isslower to train but offers more modeling choices and can lead to fastersampling.

Furthermore, we implement it by leveraginginput convex neural networks (ICNNs) for the optimal Kantorovich potential.With the optimally mapped features, a diffusion-based generator and aNerf-based decoder are subsequently utilized to transform them into 3D shapes.Extensive qualitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-artsdemonstrate the superiority of the proposed HOTS3D for 3D shape generation,especially on the consistency with text semantics.</description><author>Zezeng Li, Weimin Wang, WenHai Li, Na Lei, Xianfeng Gu</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 15:43:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14419v1</guid></item><item><title>Improving classification of road surface conditions via road area extraction and contrastive learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14418v1</link><description>Maintaining roads is crucial to economic growth and citizen well-beingbecause roads are a vital means of transportation.

While System-2 istypically more effective, it is also more computationally expensive, making itinfeasible for long plans or large action spaces. Moreover, isolated System-1or 2 ignores the user's end goals, failing to provide ways to control themodel's behavior. To this end, we propose the System-1.x Planner, acontrollable planning framework with LLMs that is capable of generating hybridplans and balancing between the two planning modes based on the difficulty ofthe problem at hand. System-1.x consists of (i) a controller, (ii) a System-1Planner, and (iii) a System-2 Planner. Based on a user-specified hybridizationfactor (x) governing the mixture between System-1 and 2, the controllerdecomposes a problem into sub-goals, and classifies them as easy or hard to besolved by either System-1 or 2, respectively. We fine-tune all three componentson top of a single base LLM, requiring only search traces as supervision.Experiments with two diverse planning tasks -- Maze Navigation and Blocksworld-- show that our System-1.x Planner outperforms a System-1 Planner, a System-2Planner trained to approximate A* search, and also a symbolic planner (A*). Wedemonstrate the following key properties of our planner: (1) controllability:increasing the hybridization factor (e.g., System-1.75 vs 1.5) performs moresearch, improving performance, (2) flexibility: by building a neuro-symbolicvariant with a neural System-1 and a symbolic System-2, we can use existingsymbolic methods, and (3) generalizability: by being able to learn fromdifferent search algorithms, our method is robust to the choice of searchalgorithm.</description><author>Swarnadeep Saha, Archiki Prasad, Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Peter Hase, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 15:40:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14414v1</guid></item><item><title>DEAL: Disentangle and Localize Concept-level Explanations for VLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14412v1</link><description>Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become ubiquitousfoundational components of other models and downstream tasks.

In this paper, we propose anovel approach to characterize the PRB load using probabilistic forecastingtechniques. First, we provide background information on the O-RAN architectureand components and emphasize the importance of energy/power consumption modelsfor sustainable implementations. The problem statement highlights the need foraccurate PRB load prediction to optimize resource allocation and powerefficiency. We then investigate probabilistic forecasting techniques, includingSimple-Feed-Forward (SFF), DeepAR, and Transformers, and discuss theirlikelihood model assumptions. The simulation results show that DeepARestimators predict the PRBs with less uncertainty and effectively capture thetemporal dependencies in the dataset compared to SFF- and Transformer-basedmodels, leading to power savings. Different percentile selections can alsoincrease power savings, but at the cost of over-/under provisioning. At thesame time, the performance of the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) is shown to beinferior to the probabilistic estimators with respect to all error metrics.Finally, we outline the importance of probabilistic, prediction-basedcharacterization for sustainable O-RAN implementations and highlight avenuesfor future research.</description><author>Vaishnavi Kasuluru, Luis Blanco, Cristian J.

For linear systems, reachability analysis isstraightforward and fast, but as more complex components are added to thecontrol system such as nonlinear dynamics or a neural network controller,reachability analysis may slow down or become overly conservative. To addressthese challenges, much literature has focused on spatial refinement, e.g.,tuning the discretization of the input sets and intermediate reachable sets.However, this paper addresses a different dimension: temporal refinement. Thebasic idea of temporal refinement is to automatically choose when along thehorizon of the reachability problem to execute slow symbolic queries whichincur less approximation error versus fast concrete queries which incur moreapproximation error. Temporal refinement can be combined with other refinementapproaches and offers an additional ``tuning knob'' with which to trade offtractability and tightness in approximate reachable set computation. Here, weintroduce an automatic framework for performing temporal refinement and wedemonstrate the effectiveness of this technique on computing approximatereachable sets for nonlinear systems with neural network control policies. Wedemonstrate the calculation of reachable sets of varying approximation errorunder varying computational budget and show that our algorithm is able togenerate approximate reachable sets with a similar amount of error to thebaseline approach in 20-70% less time.</description><author>Chelsea Sidrane, Jana Tumova</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 15:16:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14394v1</guid></item><item><title>The Future of Large Language Model Pre-training is Federated</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10853v2</link><description>Generative pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstratedimpressive performance over a wide range of tasks, thanks to the unprecedentedamount of data they have been trained on. As established scaling laws indicate,LLMs' future performance improvement depends on the amount of computing anddata sources they can leverage for pre-training. Federated learning (FL) hasthe potential to unleash the majority of the planet's data and computationalresources, which are underutilized by the data-center-focused trainingmethodology of current LLM practice. Our work presents a robust, flexible,reproducible FL approach that enables large-scale collaboration acrossinstitutions to train LLMs. We propose a scalable deployment system calledPhoton to enable the investigation and development of this new trainingparadigm for LLM pre-training. We show that Photon can be used by organizationsinterested in collaborating with their private data sources and computationalresources for pre-training LLMs with billions of parameters. This paradigmwould mobilize more computational and data resources while matching orpotentially exceeding centralized performance. We further show theeffectiveness of the federated training scales with model size and present ourapproach for training a billion-scale federated LLM using limited resources.Finally, we show that LLM training is highly resilient to the classicalchallenges of federated statistical and hardware heterogeneity. Furthermore, weshow that convergence is robust to partial participation, opening the avenuefor compute-efficient collaborative training. Photon will help data-rich actorsto become the protagonists of LLMs pre-training instead of leaving the stage tocompute-rich actors alone.</description><author>Lorenzo Sani, Alex Iacob, Zeyu Cao, Bill Marino, Yan Gao, Tomas Paulik, Wanru Zhao, William F.

Motivated by the increased theoretical and practicalinterest in navigational queries, this paper considers the question for whichof these fragments decidability of querying extends to regular path queries(RPQs). In fact, decidability of RPQs has recently been shown to generally holdfor the comprehensive family of all fragments that come with the guarantee ofuniversal models being reasonably well-shaped (that is, being of finitecliquewidth). Yet, for the second major family of fragments, known as finiteunification sets (short: fus), which are based on first-order-rewritability,corresponding results have been largely elusive so far. We complete the pictureby showing that RPQ answering over arbitrary fus rulesets is undecidable. Onthe positive side, we establish that the problem is decidable for the prominentfus subclass of sticky rulesets, with the caveat that a very mild extension ofthe RPQ formalism turns the problem undecidable again.</description><author>Piotr Ostropolski-Nalewaja, Sebastian Rudolph</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 15:11:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14384v1</guid></item><item><title>Improving GBDT Performance on Imbalanced Datasets: An Empirical Study of Class-Balanced Loss Functions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14381v1</link><description>Class imbalance remains a significant challenge in machine learning,particularly for tabular data classification tasks.

However, training the spikedepth estimation network holds significant challenges in two aspects: sparsespatial information for pixel-wise tasks and difficulties in achieving paireddepth labels for temporally intensive spike streams. Therefore, we introduceopen-source RGB data to support spike depth estimation, leveraging itsannotations and spatial information. The inherent differences in modalities anddata distribution make it challenging to directly apply transfer learning fromopen-source RGB to target spike data. To this end, we propose a cross-modalitycross-domain (BiCross) framework to realize unsupervised spike depth estimationby introducing simulated mediate source spike data. Specifically, we design aCoarse-to-Fine Knowledge Distillation (CFKD) approach to facilitatecomprehensive cross-modality knowledge transfer while preserving the uniquestrengths of both modalities, utilizing a spike-oriented uncertainty scheme.Then, we propose a Self-Correcting Teacher-Student (SCTS) mechanism to screenout reliable pixel-wise pseudo labels and ease the domain shift of the studentmodel, which avoids error accumulation in target spike data. To verify theeffectiveness of BiCross, we conduct extensive experiments on four scenarios,including Synthetic to Real, Extreme Weather, Scene Changing, and Real Spike.Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances, compared withRGB-oriented unsupervised depth estimation methods.

Technologies such as OpenRadio Access Network (O-RAN) can help to build interoperable solutions for themanagement of complex systems. Probabilistic forecasting, in contrast todeterministic single-point estimators, can offer a different approach toresource allocation by quantifying the uncertainty of the generatedpredictions. This paper examines the cloud-native aspects of O-RAN togetherwith the radio App (rApp) deployment options. The integration of probabilisticforecasting techniques as a rApp in O-RAN is also emphasized, along with casestudies of real-world applications. Through a comparative analysis offorecasting models using the error metric, we show the advantages of DeepAutoregressive Recurrent network (DeepAR) over other deterministicprobabilistic estimators. Furthermore, the simplicity of Simple-Feed-Forward(SFF) leads to a fast runtime but does not capture the temporal dependencies ofthe input data. Finally, we present some aspects related to the practicalapplicability of cloud-native O-RAN with probabilistic forecasting.</description><author>Vaishnavi Kasuluru, Luis Blanco, Engin Zeydan, Albert Bel, Angelos Antonopoulos</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 15:04:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14377v1</guid></item><item><title>On the use of Probabilistic Forecasting for Network Analysis in Open RAN</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14375v1</link><description>Unlike other single-point Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based predictiontechniques, such as Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), probabilistic forecastingtechniques (e.g., DeepAR and Transformer) provide a range of possible outcomesand associated probabilities that enable decision makers to make more informedand robust decisions.

Self-explainable models, like prototype-based models, can be especiallybeneficial as they are interpretable by design. However, if the learntprototypes are of low quality then the prototype-based models are as good asblack-box. Having high quality prototypes is a pre-requisite for a trulyinterpretable model. In this work, we propose a prototype evaluation frameworkfor coherence (PEF-C) for quantitatively evaluating the quality of theprototypes based on domain knowledge. We show the use of PEF-C in the contextof breast cancer prediction using mammography. Existing works onprototype-based models on breast cancer prediction using mammography havefocused on improving the classification performance of prototype-based modelscompared to black-box models and have evaluated prototype quality throughanecdotal evidence.

Given the subjective nature of political labels,third-party bias ratings like those from Ad Fontes Media, AllSides, and MediaBias/Fact Check (MBFC) are often used in research to analyze news sourcediversity. This study aims to determine if GPT-4 can replicate these humanratings on a seven-degree scale ("far-left" to "far-right"). The analysiscompares GPT-4's classifications against MBFC's, and controls for websitepopularity using Open PageRank scores. Findings reveal a high correlation($\text{Spearman's } \rho = .89$, $n = 5,877$, $p &lt; 0.001$) between GPT-4's andMBFC's ratings, indicating the model's potential reliability. However, GPT-4abstained from classifying approximately $\frac{2}{3}$ of the dataset,particularly less popular and less biased sources. The study also identifies aslight leftward skew in GPT-4's classifications compared to MBFC's. Theanalysis suggests that while GPT-4 can be a scalable, cost-effective tool forpolitical bias classification of news websites, but its use should complementhuman judgment to mitigate biases. Further research is recommended to explorethe model's performance across different settings, languages, and additionaldatasets.</description><author>Raphael Hernandes</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 14:28:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14344v1</guid></item><item><title>Do LLMs have Consistent Values?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12878v2</link><description>Values are a basic driving force underlying human behavior. Large LanguageModels (LLM) technology is constantly improving towards human-like dialogue.However, little research has been done to study the values exhibited in textgenerated by LLMs. Here we study this question by turning to the richliterature on value structure in psychology. We ask whether LLMs exhibit thesame value structure that has been demonstrated in humans, including theranking of values, and correlation between values. We show that the results ofthis analysis strongly depend on how the LLM is prompted, and that under aparticular prompting strategy (referred to as 'Value Anchoring') the agreementwith human data is quite compelling. Our results serve both to improve ourunderstanding of values in LLMs, as well as introduce novel methods forassessing consistency in LLM responses.</description><author>Naama Rozen, Gal Elidan, Amir Globerson, Ella Daniel</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 14:24:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12878v2</guid></item><item><title>Quantifying the value of positive transfer: An experimental case study</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14342v1</link><description>In traditional approaches to structural health monitoring, challenges oftenarise associated with the availability of labelled data.

One commonly used method toassess the reliability of LLMs' responses is uncertainty estimation, whichgauges the likelihood of their answers being correct. While many studies focuson improving the accuracy of uncertainty estimations for LLMs, our researchinvestigates the fragility of uncertainty estimation and explores potentialattacks. We demonstrate that an attacker can embed a backdoor in LLMs, which,when activated by a specific trigger in the input, manipulates the model'suncertainty without affecting the final output. Specifically, the proposedbackdoor attack method can alter an LLM's output probability distribution,causing the probability distribution to converge towards an attacker-predefineddistribution while ensuring that the top-1 prediction remains unchanged. Ourexperimental results demonstrate that this attack effectively undermines themodel's self-evaluation reliability in multiple-choice questions. For instance,we achieved a 100 attack success rate (ASR) across three different triggeringstrategies in four models. Further, we investigate whether this manipulationgeneralizes across different prompts and domains. This work highlights asignificant threat to the reliability of LLMs and underscores the need forfuture defenses against such attacks.

While most PETL approaches update the addedparameters and freeze pre-trained weights during training, the minimal impactof task-specific deep layers on cross-domain data poses a challenge as PETLcannot modify them, resulting in redundant model structures. Structural pruningeffectively reduces model redundancy; however, common pruning methods oftenlead to an excessive increase in stored parameters due to varying pruningstructures based on pruning rates and data. Recognizing the storage parametervolume issue, we propose a Straightforward layer-wise pruning method, calledSLS, for pruning PETL-transferred models. By evaluating parameters from afeature perspective of each layer and utilizing clustering metrics to assesscurrent parameters based on clustering phenomena in low-dimensional spaceobtained through t-SNE, SLS facilitates informed pruning decisions. Our studyreveals that layer-wise pruning, with a focus on storing pruning indices,addresses storage volume concerns. Notably, mainstream Layer-wise pruningmethods may not be suitable for assessing layer importance in PETL-transferredmodels, where the majority of parameters are pre-trained and have limitedrelevance to downstream datasets. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-artPETL methods demonstrates that the pruned model achieved a notable balancebetween model throughput and accuracy. Moreover, SLS effectively reducesstorage overhead arising from varying pruned structures while enhancing theaccuracy and speed of pruned models compared to conventional pruning methods.</description><author>Ruizi Han, Jinglei Tang</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 14:10:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14330v1</guid></item><item><title>Scene-Graph ViT: End-to-End Open-Vocabulary Visual Relationship Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14270v2</link><description>Visual relationship detection aims to identify objects and theirrelationships in images.

This increasingprevalence underscores the importance of ASD as a major public health concernand the need for comprehensive research initiatives to advance ourunderstanding of the disorder and its early detection methods. This studyintroduces a novel hierarchical feature fusion method aimed at enhancing theearly detection of ASD in children through the analysis of code-switched speech(English and Hindi). Employing advanced audio processing techniques, theresearch integrates acoustic, paralinguistic, and linguistic information usingTransformer Encoders. This innovative fusion strategy is designed to improveclassification robustness and accuracy, crucial for early and precise ASDidentification. The methodology involves collecting a code-switched speechcorpus, CoSAm, from children diagnosed with ASD and a matched control group.The dataset comprises 61 voice recordings from 30 children diagnosed with ASDand 31 from neurotypical children, aged between 3 and 13 years, resulting in atotal of 159.75 minutes of voice recordings. The feature analysis focuses onMFCCs and extensive statistical attributes to capture speech patternvariability and complexity. The best model performance is achieved using ahierarchical fusion technique with an accuracy of 98.75% using a combination ofacoustic and linguistic features first, followed by paralinguistic features ina hierarchical manner.</description><author>Mohd Mujtaba Akhtar, Girish, Muskaan Singh, Orchid Chetia Phukan</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 14:06:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14328v1</guid></item><item><title>Panoptic Segmentation of Mammograms with Text-To-Image Diffusion Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14326v1</link><description>Mammography is crucial for breast cancer surveillance and early diagnosis.However, analyzing mammography images is a demanding task for radiologists, whooften review hundreds of mammograms daily, leading to overdiagnosis andovertreatment.

State-of-the-art methods forefficiently solving CMDPs are based on primal-dual algorithms. For thesealgorithms, all currently known regret bounds allow for error cancellations --one can compensate for a constraint violation in one round with a strictconstraint satisfaction in another. This makes the online learning processunsafe since it only guarantees safety for the final (mixture) policy but notduring learning. As Efroni et al. (2020) pointed out, it is an open questionwhether primal-dual algorithms can provably achieve sublinear regret if we donot allow error cancellations. In this paper, we give the first affirmativeanswer. We first generalize a result on last-iterate convergence of regularizedprimal-dual schemes to CMDPs with multiple constraints. Building upon thisinsight, we propose a model-based primal-dual algorithm to learn in an unknownCMDP. We prove that our algorithm achieves sublinear regret without errorcancellations.</description><author>Adrian Müller, Pragnya Alatur, Volkan Cevher, Giorgia Ramponi, Niao He</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 14:00:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15776v3</guid></item><item><title>Towards Interpretable Sequence Continuation: Analyzing Shared Circuits in Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04131v5</link><description>While transformer models exhibit strong capabilities on linguistic tasks,their complex architectures make them difficult to interpret.

We extendthis research by analyzing and comparing circuits for similar sequencecontinuation tasks, which include increasing sequences of Arabic numerals,number words, and months. By applying circuit interpretability analysis, weidentify a key sub-circuit in both GPT-2 Small and Llama-2-7B responsible fordetecting sequence members and for predicting the next member in a sequence.Our analysis reveals that semantically related sequences rely on shared circuitsubgraphs with analogous roles. Additionally, we show that this sub-circuit haseffects on various math-related prompts, such as on intervaled circuits,Spanish number word and months continuation, and natural language wordproblems. Overall, documenting shared computational structures enables bettermodel behavior predictions, identification of errors, and safer editingprocedures.

Recent advances on large language models (LLMs)have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMscould help with misinformation detection remains relatively underexplored. Mostof existing state-of-the-art approaches either do not consider evidence andsolely focus on claim related features or assume the evidence to be provided.Few approaches consider evidence retrieval as part of the misinformationdetection but rely on fine-tuning models. In this paper, we investigate thepotential of LLMs for misinformation detection in a zero-shot setting. Weincorporate an evidence retrieval component into the process as it is crucialto gather pertinent information from various sources to detect the veracity ofclaims. To this end, we propose a novel re-ranking approach for multimodalevidence retrieval using both LLMs and large vision-language models (LVLM). Theretrieved evidence samples (images and texts) serve as the input for anLVLM-based approach for multimodal fact verification (LVLM4FV). To enable afair evaluation, we address the issue of incomplete ground truth for evidencesamples in an existing evidence retrieval dataset by annotating a more completeset of evidence samples for both image and text retrieval. Our experimentalresults on two datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach inboth evidence retrieval and fact verification tasks and also bettergeneralization capability across dataset compared to the supervised baseline.</description><author>Sahar Tahmasebi, Eric Müller-Budack, Ralph Ewerth</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 13:57:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14321v1</guid></item><item><title>Joint or Disjoint: Mixing Training Regimes for Early-Exit Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14320v1</link><description>Early exits are an important efficiency mechanism integrated into deep neuralnetworks that allows for the termination of the network's forward pass beforeprocessing through all its layers. By allowing early halting of the inferenceprocess for less complex inputs that reached high confidence, early exitssignificantly reduce the amount of computation required. Early exit methods addtrainable internal classifiers which leads to more intricacy in the trainingprocess. However, there is no consistent verification of the approaches oftraining of early exit methods, and no unified scheme of training such models.Most early exit methods employ a training strategy that either simultaneouslytrains the backbone network and the exit heads or trains the exit headsseparately. We propose a training approach where the backbone is initiallytrained on its own, followed by a phase where both the backbone and the exitheads are trained together. Thus, we advocate for organizing early-exittraining strategies into three distinct categories, and then validate them fortheir performance and efficiency. In this benchmark, we perform boththeoretical and empirical analysis of early-exit training regimes. We study themethods in terms of information flow, loss landscape and numerical rank ofactivations and gauge the suitability of regimes for various architectures anddatasets.</description><author>Bartłomiej Krzepkowski, Monika Michaluk, Franciszek Szarwacki, Piotr Kubaty, Jary Pomponi, Tomasz Trzciński, Bartosz Wójcik, Kamil Adamczewski</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 13:56:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14320v1</guid></item><item><title>A Curriculum-style Self-training Approach for Source-Free Semantic Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11653v5</link><description>Source-free domain adaptation has developed rapidly in recent years, wherethe well-trained source model is adapted to the target domain instead of thesource data, offering the potential for privacy concerns and intellectualproperty protection. However, a number of feature alignment techniques in priordomain adaptation methods are not feasible in this challenging problem setting.Thereby, we resort to probing inherent domain-invariant feature learning andpropose a curriculum-style self-training approach for source-free domainadaptive semantic segmentation. In particular, we introduce a curriculum-styleentropy minimization method to explore the implicit knowledge from the sourcemodel, which fits the trained source model to the target data using certaininformation from easy-to-hard predictions. We then train the segmentationnetwork by the proposed complementary curriculum-style self-training, whichutilizes the negative and positive pseudo labels following thecurriculum-learning manner. Although negative pseudo-labels with highuncertainty cannot be identified with the correct labels, they can definitelyindicate absent classes. Moreover, we employ an information propagation schemeto further reduce the intra-domain discrepancy within the target domain, whichcould act as a standard post-processing method for the domain adaptation field.Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to a more challenging black-boxsource model scenario where only the source model's predictions are available.Extensive experiments validate that our method yields state-of-the-artperformance on source-free semantic segmentation tasks for bothsynthetic-to-real and adverse conditions datasets.
