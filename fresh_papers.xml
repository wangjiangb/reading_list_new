In thisvein, recent work has highlighted performance gains from increasing trainingdataset size and quality, suggesting a need for novel sources of large-scaledatasets. In this work, we introduce BeanCounter, a public dataset consistingof more than 159B tokens extracted from businesses' disclosures. We show thatthis data is indeed novel: less than 0.1% of BeanCounter appears in CommonCrawl-based datasets and it is an order of magnitude larger than datasetsrelying on similar sources. Given the data's provenance, we hypothesize thatBeanCounter is comparatively more factual and less toxic than web-baseddatasets. Exploring this hypothesis, we find that many demographic identitiesoccur with similar prevalence in BeanCounter but with significantly less toxiccontext relative to other datasets. To demonstrate the utility of BeanCounter,we evaluate and compare two LLMs continually pre-trained on BeanCounter withtheir base models. We find an 18-33% reduction in toxic generation and improvedperformance within the finance domain for the continually pretrained models.Collectively, our work suggests that BeanCounter is a novel source oflow-toxicity and high-quality domain-specific data with sufficient scale totrain multi-billion parameter LLMs.</description><author>Siyan Wang, Bradford Levy</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 16:07:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17827v2</guid></item><item><title>A New Dataset for Monocular Depth Estimation Under Viewpoint Shifts</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17851v2</link><description>Monocular depth estimation is a critical task for autonomous driving and manyother computer vision applications. While significant progress has been made inthis field, the effects of viewpoint shifts on depth estimation models remainlargely underexplored. This paper introduces a novel dataset and evaluationmethodology to quantify the impact of different camera positions andorientations on monocular depth estimation performance. We propose a groundtruth strategy based on homography estimation and object detection, eliminatingthe need for expensive lidar sensors. We collect a diverse dataset of roadscenes from multiple viewpoints and use it to assess the robustness of a moderndepth estimation model to geometric shifts. After assessing the validity of ourstrategy on a public dataset, we provide valuable insights into the limitationsof current models and highlight the importance of considering viewpointvariations in real-world applications.</description><author>Aurel Pjetri, Stefano Caprasecca, Leonardo Taccari, Matteo Simoncini, Henrique Piñeiro Monteagudo, Walter Wallace, Douglas Coimbra de Andrade, Francesco Sambo, Andrew David Bagdanov</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 15:59:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17851v2</guid></item><item><title>VideoPatchCore: An Effective Method to Memorize Normality for Video Anomaly Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16225v3</link><description>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a crucial task in video analysis andsurveillance within computer vision. Currently, VAD is gaining attention withmemory techniques that store the features of normal frames. The stored featuresare utilized for frame reconstruction, identifying an abnormality when asignificant difference exists between the reconstructed and input frames.However, this approach faces several challenges due to the simultaneousoptimization required for both the memory and encoder-decoder model. Thesechallenges include increased optimization difficulty, complexity ofimplementation, and performance variability depending on the memory size. Toaddress these challenges,we propose an effective memory method for VAD, calledVideoPatchCore. Inspired by PatchCore, our approach introduces a structure thatprioritizes memory optimization and configures three types of memory tailoredto the characteristics of video data. This method effectively addresses thelimitations of existing memory-based methods, achieving good performancecomparable to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our method requires notraining and is straightforward to implement, making VAD tasks more accessible.Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-VideoPatchCore.</description><author>Sunghyun Ahn, Youngwan Jo, Kijung Lee, Sanghyun Park</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 14:04:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16225v3</guid></item><item><title>Fine Tuning vs. Retrieval Augmented Generation for Less Popular Knowledge</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01432v4</link><description>Language Models (LMs) memorize a vast amount of factual knowledge, exhibitingstrong performance across diverse tasks and domains. However, it has beenobserved that the performance diminishes when dealing with less-popular orlow-frequency concepts and entities, for example in domain specificapplications. The two prominent approaches to enhance the performance of LMs onlow-frequent topics are: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning(FT) over synthetic data. This paper explores and evaluates the impact of RAGand FT on customizing LMs in handling low-frequency entities on questionanswering tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on twelve LMs of varying sizeand type and different fine tuning, data augmentation, and retrieval models.Our findings indicate that while FT boosts the performance across entities ofvarying popularity, RAG surpasses FT by a large margin particularly for leastpopular factual knowledge. Additionally, the success of both RAG and FTapproaches is amplified by improving retrieval and data augmentationtechniques. Fine tuning, while beneficial for small LMs, requires extensiveresources. To address this issue, we propose the new Stimulus RAG approach thatsurpasses the effectiveness of fine tuning based approaches, therebyeliminating the need for the costly data augmentation and fine tuning step forenriching LMs with less popular factual knowledge.</description><author>Heydar Soudani, Evangelos Kanoulas, Faegheh Hasibi</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 13:47:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01432v4</guid></item><item><title>Automating Data Annotation under Strategic Human Agents: Risks and Potential Solutions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08027v3</link><description>As machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used in social domains tomake consequential decisions about humans, they often have the power to reshapedata distributions. Humans, as strategic agents, continuously adapt theirbehaviors in response to the learning system. As populations changedynamically, ML systems may need frequent updates to ensure high performance.However, acquiring high-quality human-annotated samples can be highlychallenging and even infeasible in social domains. A common practice to addressthis issue is using the model itself to annotate unlabeled data samples. Thispaper investigates the long-term impacts when ML models are retrained withmodel-annotated samples when they incorporate human strategic responses. Wefirst formalize the interactions between strategic agents and the model andthen analyze how they evolve under such dynamic interactions. We find thatagents are increasingly likely to receive positive decisions as the model getsretrained, whereas the proportion of agents with positive labels may decreaseover time. We thus propose a refined retraining process to stabilize thedynamics. Last, we examine how algorithmic fairness can be affected by theseretraining processes and find that enforcing common fairness constraints atevery round may not benefit the disadvantaged group in the long run.Experiments on (semi-)synthetic and real data validate the theoreticalfindings.</description><author>Tian Xie, Xueru Zhang</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 12:27:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08027v3</guid></item><item><title>Plurals: A System for Guiding LLMs Via Simulated Social Ensembles</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17213v2</link><description>Recent debates raised concerns that language models may favor certainviewpoints. But what if the solution is not to aim for a 'view from nowhere'but rather to leverage different viewpoints? We introduce Plurals, a system andPython library for pluralistic AI deliberation. Plurals consists of Agents(LLMs, optionally with personas) which deliberate within customizableStructures, with Moderators overseeing deliberation. Plurals is a generator ofsimulated social ensembles. Plurals integrates with government datasets tocreate nationally representative personas, includes deliberation templatesinspired by democratic deliberation theory, and allows users to customize bothinformation-sharing structures and deliberation behavior within Structures. Sixcase studies demonstrate fidelity to theoretical constructs and efficacy. Threerandomized experiments show simulated focus groups produced output resonantwith an online sample of the relevant audiences (chosen over zero-shotgeneration in 75% of trials). Plurals is both a paradigm and a concrete systemfor pluralistic AI. The Plurals library is available athttps://github.com/josh-ashkinaze/plurals and will be continually updated.</description><author>Joshua Ashkinaze, Emily Fry, Narendra Edara, Eric Gilbert, Ceren Budak</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 12:12:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17213v2</guid></item><item><title>Semi-Supervised Cognitive State Classification from Speech with Multi-View Pseudo-Labeling</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16937v2</link><description>The lack of labeled data is a common challenge in speech classificationtasks, particularly those requiring extensive subjective assessment, such ascognitive state classification. In this work, we propose a Semi-SupervisedLearning (SSL) framework, introducing a novel multi-view pseudo-labeling methodthat leverages both acoustic and linguistic characteristics to select the mostconfident data for training the classification model. Acoustically, unlabeleddata are compared to labeled data using the Frechet audio distance, calculatedfrom embeddings generated by multiple audio encoders. Linguistically, largelanguage models are prompted to revise automatic speech recognitiontranscriptions and predict labels based on our proposed task-specificknowledge. High-confidence data are identified when pseudo-labels from bothsources align, while mismatches are treated as low-confidence data. A bimodalclassifier is then trained to iteratively label the low-confidence data until apredefined criterion is met. We evaluate our SSL framework on emotionrecognition and dementia detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate thatour method achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervisedlearning using only 30% of the labeled data and significantly outperforms twoselected baselines.</description><author>Yuanchao Li, Zixing Zhang, Jing Han, Peter Bell, Catherine Lai</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 11:16:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16937v2</guid></item><item><title>MoJE: Mixture of Jailbreak Experts, Naive Tabular Classifiers as Guard for Prompt Attacks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17699v2</link><description>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in diverse applicationsunderscores the pressing need for robust security measures to thwart potentialjailbreak attacks. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities within LLMs, endangerdata integrity and user privacy. Guardrails serve as crucial protectivemechanisms against such threats, but existing models often fall short in termsof both detection accuracy, and computational efficiency. This paper advocatesfor the significance of jailbreak attack prevention on LLMs, and emphasises therole of input guardrails in safeguarding these models. We introduce MoJE(Mixture of Jailbreak Expert), a novel guardrail architecture designed tosurpass current limitations in existing state-of-the-art guardrails. Byemploying simple linguistic statistical techniques, MoJE excels in detectingjailbreak attacks while maintaining minimal computational overhead during modelinference. Through rigorous experimentation, MoJE demonstrates superiorperformance capable of detecting 90% of the attacks without compromising benignprompts, enhancing LLMs security against jailbreak attacks.</description><author>Giandomenico Cornacchia, Giulio Zizzo, Kieran Fraser, Muhammad Zaid Hamed, Ambrish Rawat, Mark Purcell</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 10:16:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17699v2</guid></item><item><title>Leveraging Anthropometric Measurements to Improve Human Mesh Estimation and Ensure Consistent Body Shapes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17671v2</link><description>The basic body shape of a person does not change within a single video.However, most SOTA human mesh estimation (HME) models output a slightlydifferent body shape for each video frame, which results in inconsistent bodyshapes for the same person. In contrast, we leverage anthropometricmeasurements like tailors are already obtaining from humans for centuries. Wecreate a model called A2B that converts such anthropometric measurements tobody shape parameters of human mesh models. Moreover, we find that finetunedSOTA 3D human pose estimation (HPE) models outperform HME models regarding theprecision of the estimated keypoints. We show that applying inverse kinematics(IK) to the results of such a 3D HPE model and combining the resulting bodypose with the A2B body shape leads to superior and consistent human meshes forchallenging datasets like ASPset or fit3D, where we can lower the MPJPE by over30 mm compared to SOTA HME models. Further, replacing HME models estimates ofthe body shape parameters with A2B model results not only increases theperformance of these HME models, but also leads to consistent body shapes.</description><author>Katja Ludwig, Julian Lorenz, Daniel Kienzle, Tuan Bui, Rainer Lienhart</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 10:02:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17671v2</guid></item><item><title>Few-shot Pairwise Rank Prompting: An Effective Non-Parametric Retrieval Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17745v2</link><description>A supervised ranking model, despite its advantage of being effective, usuallyinvolves complex processing - typically multiple stages of task-specificpre-training and fine-tuning. This has motivated researchers to explore simplerpipelines leveraging large language models (LLMs) that are capable of workingin a zero-shot manner. However, since zero-shot inference does not make use ofa training set of pairs of queries and their relevant documents, itsperformance is mostly worse than that of supervised models, which are trainedon such example pairs. Motivated by the existing findings that trainingexamples generally improve zero-shot performance, in our work, we explore ifthis also applies to ranking models. More specifically, given a query and apair of documents, the preference prediction task is improved by augmentingexamples of preferences for similar queries from a training set. Our proposedpairwise few-shot ranker demonstrates consistent improvements over thezero-shot baseline on both in-domain (TREC DL) and out-domain (BEIR subset)retrieval benchmarks. Our method also achieves a close performance to that of asupervised model without requiring any complex training pipeline.</description><author>Nilanjan Sinhababu, Andrew Parry, Debasis Ganguly, Debasis Samanta, Pabitra Mitra</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 08:19:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17745v2</guid></item><item><title>Confidence intervals uncovered: Are we ready for real-world medical imaging AI?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17763v2</link><description>Medical imaging is spearheading the AI transformation of healthcare.Performance reporting is key to determine which methods should be translatedinto clinical practice. Frequently, broad conclusions are simply derived frommean performance values. In this paper, we argue that this common practice isoften a misleading simplification as it ignores performance variability. Ourcontribution is threefold. (1) Analyzing all MICCAI segmentation papers (n =221) published in 2023, we first observe that more than 50% of papers do notassess performance variability at all. Moreover, only one (0.5%) paper reportedconfidence intervals (CIs) for model performance. (2) To address the reportingbottleneck, we show that the unreported standard deviation (SD) in segmentationpapers can be approximated by a second-order polynomial function of the meanDice similarity coefficient (DSC). Based on external validation data from 56previous MICCAI challenges, we demonstrate that this approximation canaccurately reconstruct the CI of a method using information provided inpublications. (3) Finally, we reconstructed 95% CIs around the mean DSC ofMICCAI 2023 segmentation papers. The median CI width was 0.03 which is threetimes larger than the median performance gap between the first and secondranked method. For more than 60% of papers, the mean performance of thesecond-ranked method was within the CI of the first-ranked method. We concludethat current publications typically do not provide sufficient evidence tosupport which models could potentially be translated into clinical practice.</description><author>Evangelia Christodoulou, Annika Reinke, Rola Houhou, Piotr Kalinowski, Selen Erkan, Carole H.

In RLHF and DPO, a regularization term is usedduring the preference optimization process to prevent the policy model fromdeviating too far from the reference model's distribution, thereby avoiding thegeneration of anomalous responses. When the reference model is alreadywell-aligned with the given data or only requires slight adjustments, thisapproach can produce a well-aligned model. However, if the reference model isnot aligned with the given data and requires significant deviation from itscurrent state, a regularization term may actually hinder the model alignment.In this study, we propose \textbf{Modulated Intervention PreferenceOptimization (MIPO)} to address this issue. MIPO modulates the degree ofintervention from the reference model based on how well the given data isaligned with it. If the data is well-aligned, the intervention is increased toprevent the policy model from diverging significantly from reference model.Conversely, if the alignment is poor, the interference is reduced to facilitatemore extensive training. We compare the performance of MIPO and DPO usingMistral-7B and Llama3-8B in Alpaca Eval 2.0 and MT-Bench.

However, distinct patterns in human sensing,influenced by various factors or contexts, challenge generic neural networkmodel's performance due to natural distribution shifts. To address this,personalization tailors models to individual users. Yet most personalizationstudies overlook intra-user heterogeneity across contexts in sensory data,limiting intra-user generalizability. This limitation is especially critical inclinical applications, where limited data availability hampers bothgeneralizability and personalization. Notably, intra-user sensing attributesare expected to change due to external factors such as treatment progression,further complicating the challenges. This work introduces CRoP, a novel staticpersonalization approach using an off-the-shelf pre-trained model and pruningto optimize personalization and generalization. CRoP shows superiorpersonalization effectiveness and intra-user robustness across fourhuman-sensing datasets, including two from real-world health domains,highlighting its practical and social impact. Additionally, to support CRoP'sgeneralization ability and design choices, we provide empirical justificationthrough gradient inner product analysis, ablation studies, and comparisonsagainst state-of-the-art baselines.</description><author>Sawinder Kaur, Avery Gump, Jingyu Xin, Yi Xiao, Harshit Sharma, Nina R Benway, Jonathan L Preston, Asif Salekin</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 04:03:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17994v2</guid></item><item><title>InterNet: Unsupervised Cross-modal Homography Estimation Based on Interleaved Modality Transfer and Self-supervised Homography Prediction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17993v2</link><description>We propose a novel unsupervised cross-modal homography estimation framework,based on interleaved modality transfer and self-supervised homographyprediction, named InterNet. InterNet integrates modality transfer andself-supervised homography estimation, introducing an innovative interleavedoptimization framework to alternately promote both components. The modalitytransfer gradually narrows the modality gaps, facilitating the self-supervisedhomography estimation to fully leverage the synthetic intra-modal data. Theself-supervised homography estimation progressively achieves reliablepredictions, thereby providing robust cross-modal supervision for the modalitytransfer. To further boost the estimation accuracy, we also formulate afine-grained homography feature loss to improve the connection between twocomponents.

Numbers can betokenized into tokens in various ways by different LLMs and affect the numericoperations performance. Currently, there are two representatives: 1) Tokenizeinto $1$-digit, and 2) Tokenize into $1\sim 3$ digit. The difference is roughlyequivalent to using different numeral systems (namely base $10$ or base$10^{3}$). In light of this, we study the scaling behavior of different numeralsystems in the context of transformer-based large language models. Weempirically show that a base $10$ system is consistently more data-efficientthan a base $10^{2}$ or $10^{3}$ system across training data scale, model sizesunder from-scratch training settings, while different number systems have verysimilar fine-tuning performances. We attribute this to higher token frequenciesof a base $10$ system. Additionally, we reveal extrapolation behavior patternson addition and multiplication.

Thehuman-centered explainable AI (HCXAI) movement identifies theexplanation-oriented needs of users but can't fulfill them because of itscommitment to machine learning. In order to achieve the kinds of explanationsneeded by real people operating in critical domains, we must rethink how toapproach AI.

However, thedesign of a multi-user SC system becomes more challenging because of thecomputing and communication overhead required for coordination. Existingsolutions for learning the semantic language and performing resource allocationoften fail to capture the computing and communication tradeoffs involved inmultiuser SC. To address this gap, a novel framework for decentralizedcomputing and communication resource allocation in multiuser SC systems isproposed. The challenge of efficiently allocating communication and computingresources (for reasoning) in a decentralized manner to maximize the quality oftask experience for the end users is addressed through the application ofStackelberg hyper game theory. Leveraging the concept of second-level hypergames, novel analytical formulations are developed to model misperceptions ofthe users about each other's communication and control strategies. Further,equilibrium analysis of the learned resource allocation protocols examines theconvergence of the computing and communication strategies to a localStackelberg equilibria, considering misperceptions. Simulation results showthat the proposed Stackelberg hyper game results in efficient usage ofcommunication and computing resources while maintaining a high quality ofexperience for the users compared to state-of-the-art that does not account forthe misperceptions.</description><author>Christo Kurisummoottil Thomas, Walid Saad</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 02:08:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17985v2</guid></item><item><title>Internalizing ASR with Implicit Chain of Thought for Efficient Speech-to-Speech Conversational LLM</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17353v2</link><description>Current speech-based LLMs are predominantly trained on extensive ASR and TTSdatasets, excelling in tasks related to these domains.

Furthermore, a critical question arises: Whatexactly should be attributed? This involves identifying the specificinformation units within an answer that require grounding. In this paper, wepropose and investigate a novel approach to the factual decomposition ofgenerated answers for attribution, employing template-based in-contextlearning.

By learning the velocity field through flow-matching,flow-based models tend to produce a straighter sampling trajectory, which isadvantageous during the sampling process. However, unlike diffusion models forwhich fast samplers are well-developed, efficient sampling of flow-basedgenerative models has been rarely explored. In this paper, we propose aframework called FlowTurbo to accelerate the sampling of flow-based modelswhile still enhancing the sampling quality. Our primary observation is that thevelocity predictor's outputs in the flow-based models will become stable duringthe sampling, enabling the estimation of velocity via a lightweight velocityrefiner. Additionally, we introduce several techniques including a pseudocorrector and sample-aware compilation to further reduce inference time. SinceFlowTurbo does not change the multi-step sampling paradigm, it can beeffectively applied for various tasks such as image editing, inpainting, etc.By integrating FlowTurbo into different flow-based models, we obtain anacceleration ratio of 53.1%$\sim$58.3% on class-conditional generation and29.8%$\sim$38.5% on text-to-image generation. Notably, FlowTurbo reaches an FIDof 2.12 on ImageNet with 100 (ms / img) and FID of 3.93 with 38 (ms / img),achieving the real-time image generation and establishing the newstate-of-the-art.

However, the developmentof LMMs with 3D-awareness for 3D scene understanding has been hindered by thelack of large-scale 3D vision-language datasets and powerful 3D encoders. Inthis paper, we introduce a simple yet effective framework called LLaVA-3D.Leveraging the strong 2D understanding priors from LLaVA, our LLaVA-3Defficiently adapts LLaVA for 3D scene understanding without compromising 2Dunderstanding capabilities. To achieve this, we employ a simple yet effectiverepresentation, 3D Patch, which connects 2D CLIP patch features with theircorresponding positions in 3D space. By integrating the 3D Patches into 2D LMMsand employing joint 2D and 3D vision-language instruction tuning, we establisha unified architecture for both 2D image understanding and 3D sceneunderstanding. Experimental results show that LLaVA-3D converges 3.5x fasterthan existing 3D LMMs when trained on 3D vision-language datasets.

However, existing methods often uncritically use the originaldiffusion formulation, which may not be optimal due to the fundamentaldifferences between dense prediction and image generation. In this paper, weprovide a systemic analysis of the diffusion formulation for the denseprediction, focusing on both quality and efficiency. And we find that theoriginal parameterization type for image generation, which learns to predictnoise, is harmful for dense prediction; the multi-step noising/denoisingdiffusion process is also unnecessary and challenging to optimize. Based onthese insights, we introduce Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation modelwith a simple yet effective adaptation protocol for dense prediction.Specifically, Lotus is trained to directly predict annotations instead ofnoise, thereby avoiding harmful variance. We also reformulate the diffusionprocess into a single-step procedure, simplifying optimization andsignificantly boosting inference speed. Additionally, we introduce a noveltuning strategy called detail preserver, which achieves more accurate andfine-grained predictions. Without scaling up the training data or modelcapacity, Lotus achieves SoTA performance in zero-shot depth and normalestimation across various datasets. It also significantly enhances efficiency,being hundreds of times faster than most existing diffusion-based methods.</description><author>Jing He, Haodong Li, Wei Yin, Yixun Liang, Leheng Li, Kaiqiang Zhou, Hongbo Liu, Bingbing Liu, Ying-Cong Chen</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 17:58:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18124v1</guid></item><item><title>Robot See Robot Do: Imitating Articulated Object Manipulation with Monocular 4D Reconstruction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18121v1</link><description>Humans can learn to manipulate new objects by simply watching others;providing robots with the ability to learn from such demonstrations wouldenable a natural interface specifying new behaviors. This work develops RobotSee Robot Do (RSRD), a method for imitating articulated object manipulationfrom a single monocular RGB human demonstration given a single staticmulti-view object scan. We first propose 4D Differentiable Part Models(4D-DPM), a method for recovering 3D part motion from a monocular video withdifferentiable rendering. This analysis-by-synthesis approach uses part-centricfeature fields in an iterative optimization which enables the use of geometricregularizers to recover 3D motions from only a single video. Given this 4Dreconstruction, the robot replicates object trajectories by planning bimanualarm motions that induce the demonstrated object part motion. By representingdemonstrations as part-centric trajectories, RSRD focuses on replicating thedemonstration's intended behavior while considering the robot's ownmorphological limits, rather than attempting to reproduce the hand's motion. Weevaluate 4D-DPM's 3D tracking accuracy on ground truth annotated 3D parttrajectories and RSRD's physical execution performance on 9 objects across 10trials each on a bimanual YuMi robot. Each phase of RSRD achieves an average of87% success rate, for a total end-to-end success rate of 60% across 90 trials.Notably, this is accomplished using only feature fields distilled from largepretrained vision models -- without any task-specific training, fine-tuning,dataset collection, or annotation.

One of the most successful applicationsof UAVs is to generate orthomosaics or orthomaps, in which a series of imagesare integrated together to develop a larger map. However, the use of CMOS-basedcameras with global or rolling shutters mean that orthomaps are vulnerable tochallenging light conditions, motion blur, and high-speed motion ofindependently moving objects under the camera. Event cameras are less sensitiveto these issues, as their pixels are able to trigger asynchronously onbrightness changes. This work introduces the first orthomosaic approach usingevent cameras.

Because causal discovery without furtherassumptions is an ill-posed problem, each algorithm comes with its own set ofusually untestable assumptions, some of which are hard to meet in realdatasets. Motivated by these considerations, this paper extensively benchmarksthe empirical performance of recent causal discovery methods on observationali.i.d. data generated under different background conditions, allowing forviolations of the critical assumptions required by each selected approach. Ourexperimental findings show that score matching-based methods demonstratesurprising performance in the false positive and false negative rate of theinferred graph in these challenging scenarios, and we provide theoreticalinsights into their performance. This work is also the first effort tobenchmark the stability of causal discovery algorithms with respect to thevalues of their hyperparameters.

However, these solvers exhibitsignificant performance degradation when applied to large-scale CO problems.Recently, two-stage neural methods with divide-and-conquer strategies haveshown efficiency in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, theperformance of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics ineither the divide or the conquer procedure, which limits their applicability togeneral CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemesand ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conqueringstrategies, which often leads to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle thesedrawbacks, this article develops a unified neural divide-and-conquer framework(i.e., UDC) for solving general large-scale CO problems.

To verify thesignificance of these models, a number of benchmarks have been proposed todiagnose their capabilities in different scenarios. However, existingbenchmarks merely evaluate models through video-level question-answering,lacking fine-grained event-level assessment and task diversity. To fill thisgap, we introduce E.T. Bench (Event-Level &amp; Time-Sensitive Video UnderstandingBenchmark), a large-scale and high-quality benchmark for open-ended event-levelvideo understanding. Categorized within a 3-level task taxonomy, E.T. Benchencompasses 7.3K samples under 12 tasks with 7K videos (251.4h total length)under 8 domains, providing comprehensive evaluations. We extensively evaluated8 Image-LLMs and 12 Video-LLMs on our benchmark, and the results reveal thatstate-of-the-art models for coarse-level (video-level) understanding struggleto solve our fine-grained tasks, e.g., grounding event-of-interests withinvideos, largely due to the short video context length, improper timerepresentations, and lack of multi-event training data. Focusing on theseissues, we further propose a strong baseline model, E.T. Chat, together with aninstruction-tuning dataset E.T. Instruct 164K tailored for fine-grainedevent-level understanding.

Monitoring rhinos' movement is crucial to their protectionbut has unfortunately proven difficult because rhinos are elusive. Therefore,instead of tracking rhinos, we propose the novel approach of mapping communaldefecation sites, called middens, which give information about rhinos' spatialbehavior valuable to anti-poaching, management, and reintroduction efforts.This paper provides the first-ever mapping of rhino midden locations bybuilding classifiers to detect them using remotely sensed thermal, RGB, andLiDAR imagery in passive and active learning settings. As existing activelearning methods perform poorly due to the extreme class imbalance in ourdataset, we design MultimodAL, an active learning system employing a rankingtechnique and multimodality to achieve competitive performance with passivelearning models with 94% fewer labels. Our methods could therefore save over 76hours in labeling time when used on a similarly-sized dataset. Unexpectedly,our midden map reveals that rhino middens are not randomly distributedthroughout the landscape; rather, they are clustered. Consequently, rangersshould be targeted at areas with high midden densities to strengthenanti-poaching efforts, in line with UN Target 15.7.</description><author>Lucia Gordon, Nikhil Behari, Samuel Collier, Elizabeth Bondi-Kelly, Jackson A.

However,inconsistent reports of the benefits of SSP for segmentation have made itdifficult to apply SSP to CMR. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate SSPmethods for CMR cine segmentation. To this end, short-axis cine stacks of 296 subjects (90618 2D slices) wereused for unlabeled pretraining with four SSP methods; SimCLR, positionalcontrastive learning, DINO, and masked image modeling (MIM). Subsets of varyingnumbers of subjects were used for supervised fine-tuning of 2D models for eachSSP method, as well as to train a 2D baseline model from scratch. Thefine-tuned models were compared to the baseline using the 3D Dice similaritycoefficient (DSC) in a test dataset of 140 subjects. The SSP methods showed no performance gains with the largest supervisedfine-tuning subset compared to the baseline (DSC = 0.89). When only 10 subjects(231 2D slices) are available for supervised training, SSP using MIM (DSC =0.86) improves over training from scratch (DSC = 0.82). This study found that SSP is valuable for CMR cine segmentation when labeledtraining data is scarce, but does not aid state-of-the-art deep learningmethods when ample labeled data is available. Moreover, the choice of SSPmethod is important. The code is publicly available at:https://github.com/q-cardIA/ssp-cmr-cine-segmentation</description><author>Rob A. J. de Mooij, Josien P. W.

Itremains unknown whether the nature of the instruction data has an impact on themodel output; conversely, it is questionable whether translated test sets cancapture such nuances. Due to the often coupled practices of using translateddata in both stages, such imperfections could have been overlooked. This workinvestigates these issues using controlled native or translated data during theinstruction tuning and evaluation stages. We show that native or generationbenchmarks reveal a notable difference between native and translatedinstruction data especially when model performance is high, whereas other typesof test sets cannot.

To address this challenge, we propose an AI-drivenclosed-loop view guidance system with human-in-the-loop feedback, designed toassist users in navigating ICE imaging without requiring specialized knowledge.Our method models the relative position and orientation vectors betweenarbitrary views and clinically defined ICE views in a spatial coordinatesystem, guiding users on how to manipulate the ICE catheter to transition fromthe current view to the desired view over time. Operating in a closed-loopconfiguration, the system continuously predicts and updates the necessarycatheter manipulations, ensuring seamless integration into existing clinicalworkflows.

Despite these advancements, the creation of controllable 3DGS-basedhead avatars remains time-intensive, often requiring tens of minutes to hours.To expedite this process, we here introduce the ``Gaussian D\'ej\`a-vu"framework, which first obtains a generalized model of the head avatar and thenpersonalizes the result. The generalized model is trained on large 2D(synthetic and real) image datasets. This model provides a well-initialized 3DGaussian head that is further refined using a monocular video to achieve thepersonalized head avatar. For personalizing, we propose learnableexpression-aware rectification blendmaps to correct the initial 3D Gaussians,ensuring rapid convergence without the reliance on neural networks. Experimentsdemonstrate that the proposed method meets its objectives.

However, real human instructions inherently possess ambiguity,because the human speakers assume sufficient prior knowledge about their hiddengoals and intentions. Standard language grounding and planning methods fail toaddress such ambiguities because they do not model human internal goals asadditional partially observable factors in the environment. We propose a newframework, Follow Instructions with Social and Embodied Reasoning (FISER),aiming for better natural language instruction following in collaborativeembodied tasks. Our framework makes explicit inferences about human goals andintentions as intermediate reasoning steps. We implement a set ofTransformer-based models and evaluate them over a challenging benchmark,HandMeThat. We empirically demonstrate that using social reasoning toexplicitly infer human intentions before making action plans surpasses purelyend-to-end approaches. We also compare our implementation with strongbaselines, including Chain of Thought prompting on the largest availablepre-trained language models, and find that FISER provides better performance onthe embodied social reasoning tasks under investigation, reaching thestate-of-the-art on HandMeThat.</description><author>Yanming Wan, Yue Wu, Yiping Wang, Jiayuan Mao, Natasha Jaques</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 17:19:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18073v1</guid></item><item><title>FreeEdit: Mask-free Reference-based Image Editing with Multi-modal Instruction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18071v1</link><description>Introducing user-specified visual concepts in image editing is highlypractical as these concepts convey the user's intent more precisely thantext-based descriptions.

This implicit way of locating theediting area eliminates the need for manual editing masks. To enhance thereconstruction of reference details, we introduce the Decoupled ResidualReferAttention (DRRA) module. This module is designed to integrate fine-grainedreference features extracted by a detail extractor into the image editingprocess in a residual way without interfering with the original self-attention.Given that existing datasets are unsuitable for reference-based image editingtasks, particularly due to the difficulty in constructing image triplets thatinclude a reference image, we curate a high-quality dataset, FreeBench, using anewly developed twice-repainting scheme. FreeBench comprises the images beforeand after editing, detailed editing instructions, as well as a reference imagethat maintains the identity of the edited object, encompassing tasks such asobject addition, replacement, and deletion. By conducting phased training onFreeBench followed by quality tuning, FreeEdit achieves high-quality zero-shotediting through convenient language instructions.

Applications of areal-world simulator range from controllable content creation in games andmovies, to training embodied agents purely in simulation that can be directlydeployed in the real world. We explore the possibility of learning a universalsimulator (UniSim) of real-world interaction through generative modeling. Wefirst make the important observation that natural datasets available forlearning a real-world simulator are often rich along different dimensions(e.g., abundant objects in image data, densely sampled actions in roboticsdata, and diverse movements in navigation data). With careful orchestration ofdiverse datasets, each providing a different aspect of the overall experience,we can simulate the visual outcome of both high-level instructions such as"open the drawer" and low-level controls from otherwise static scenes andobjects. We use the simulator to train both high-level vision-language policiesand low-level reinforcement learning policies, each of which can be deployed inthe real world in zero shot after training purely in simulation. We also showthat other types of intelligence such as video captioning models can benefitfrom training with simulated experience, opening up even wider applications.Video demos can be found at https://universal-simulator.github.io.</description><author>Sherry Yang, Yilun Du, Kamyar Ghasemipour, Jonathan Tompson, Leslie Kaelbling, Dale Schuurmans, Pieter Abbeel</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 17:14:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06114v3</guid></item><item><title>Optimal Protocols for Continual Learning via Statistical Physics and Control Theory</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18061v1</link><description>Artificial neural networks often struggle with catastrophic forgetting whenlearning multiple tasks sequentially, as training on new tasks degrades theperformance on previously learned ones.

However, one major limitation of the NeRF-basedavatars is the slow rendering speed due to the dense point sampling of NeRF,preventing them from broader utility on resource-constrained devices. Weintroduce LightAvatar, the first head avatar model based on neural light fields(NeLFs). LightAvatar renders an image from 3DMM parameters and a camera posevia a single network forward pass, without using mesh or volume rendering. Theproposed approach, while being conceptually appealing, poses a significantchallenge towards real-time efficiency and training stability. To resolve them,we introduce dedicated network designs to obtain proper representations for theNeLF model and maintain a low FLOPs budget. Meanwhile, we tap into adistillation-based training strategy that uses a pretrained avatar model asteacher to synthesize abundant pseudo data for training. A warping fieldnetwork is introduced to correct the fitting error in the real data so that themodel can learn better.

This requires visual representations to be distinct,despite strong variations in camera viewpoint and scene appearance. Existingvisual place recognition pipelines encode the "whole" image and search formatches. This poses a fundamental challenge in matching two images of the sameplace captured from different camera viewpoints: "the similarity of whatoverlaps can be dominated by the dissimilarity of what does not overlap". Weaddress this by encoding and searching for "image segments" instead of thewhole images. We propose to use open-set image segmentation to decompose animage into `meaningful' entities (i.e., things and stuff). This enables us tocreate a novel image representation as a collection of multiple overlappingsubgraphs connecting a segment with its neighboring segments, dubbedSuperSegment. Furthermore, to efficiently encode these SuperSegments intocompact vector representations, we propose a novel factorized representation offeature aggregation. We show that retrieving these partial representationsleads to significantly higher recognition recall than the typical whole imagebased retrieval. Our segments-based approach, dubbed SegVLAD, sets a newstate-of-the-art in place recognition on a diverse selection of benchmarkdatasets, while being applicable to both generic and task-specialized imageencoders. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our method to ``revisitanything'' by evaluating our method on an object instance retrieval task, whichbridges the two disparate areas of research: visual place recognition andobject-goal navigation, through their common aim of recognizing goal objectsspecific to a place.

HiF8 features taperedprecision. For normal value encoding, it provides 7 exponent values with 3-bitmantissa, 8 exponent values with 2-bit mantissa, and 16 exponent values with1-bit mantissa. For denormal value encoding, it extends the dynamic range by 7extra powers of 2, from 31 to 38 binades (notice that FP16 covers 40 binades).Meanwhile, HiF8 encodes all the special values except that positive zero andnegative zero are represented by only one bit-pattern. Thanks to the betterbalance between precision and dynamic range, HiF8 can be simultaneously used inboth forward and backward passes of AI training. In this paper, we willdescribe the definition and rounding methods of HiF8, as well as the tentativetraining and inference solutions.

However, simulating flow physics across complexgeometries remains numerically challenging and computationallyresource-intensive, particularly when using conventional PDE solvers. Machinelearning methods offer attractive opportunities to create fast and adaptablePDE solvers. However, benchmark datasets to measure the performance of suchmethods are scarce, especially for flow physics across complex geometries. Weintroduce FlowBench, a dataset for neural simulators with over 10K samples,which is currently larger than any publicly available flow physics dataset.FlowBench contains flow simulation data across complex geometries(\textit{parametric vs. non-parametric}), spanning a range of flow conditions(\textit{Reynolds number and Grashoff number}), capturing a diverse array offlow phenomena (\textit{steady vs. transient; forced vs. free convection}), andfor both 2D and 3D. FlowBench contains over 10K data samples, with each samplethe outcome of a fully resolved, direct numerical simulation using awell-validated simulator framework designed for modeling transport phenomena incomplex geometries. For each sample, we include velocity, pressure, andtemperature field data at 3 different resolutions and several summarystatistics features of engineering relevance (such as coefficients of lift anddrag, and Nusselt numbers). %Additionally, we include masks and signed distancefields for each shape. We envision that FlowBench will enable evaluating theinterplay between complex geometry, coupled flow phenomena, and datasufficiency on the performance of current, and future, neural PDE solvers. Weenumerate several evaluation metrics to help rank order the performance ofneural PDE solvers.

Conventional MD softwarestruggles with the balance between time cost and prediction accuracy, whichrestricts its wider application. Recently, data-driven approaches based on deepgenerative models have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which aim atlearning dynamics of diverse molecular systems over a long timestep, enjoyingboth universality and efficiency. Nevertheless, most current methods aredesigned solely to learn from the data distribution regardless of theunderlying Boltzmann distribution, and the physics priors such as energies andforces are constantly overlooked. In this work, we propose a conditionalgenerative model called Force-guided Bridge Matching (FBM), which learnsfull-atom time-coarsened dynamics and targets the Boltzmann-constraineddistribution. With the guidance of our delicately-designed intermediate forcefield, FBM leverages favourable physics priors into the generation process,giving rise to enhanced simulations. Experiments on two datasets consisting ofpeptides verify our superiority in terms of comprehensive metrics anddemonstrate transferability to unseen systems.</description><author>Ziyang Yu, Wenbing Huang, Yang Liu</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 16:38:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15126v5</guid></item><item><title>Exploring Event-based Human Pose Estimation with 3D Event Representations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04591v4</link><description>Human pose estimation is a fundamental and appealing task in computer vision.Although traditional cameras are commonly applied, their reliability decreasesin scenarios under high dynamic range or heavy motion blur, where event camerasoffer a robust solution. Predominant event-based methods accumulate events intoframes, ignoring the asynchronous and high temporal resolution that is crucialfor distinguishing distinct actions. To address this issue and to unlock the 3Dpotential of event information, we introduce two 3D event representations: theRasterized Event Point Cloud (RasEPC) and the Decoupled Event Voxel (DEV). TheRasEPC aggregates events within concise temporal slices at identical positions,preserving their 3D attributes along with statistical information, therebysignificantly reducing memory and computational demands. Meanwhile, the DEVrepresentation discretizes events into voxels and projects them across threeorthogonal planes, utilizing decoupled event attention to retrieve 3D cues fromthe 2D planes. Furthermore, we develop and release EV-3DPW, a syntheticevent-based dataset crafted to facilitate training and quantitative analysis inoutdoor scenes. Our methods are tested on the DHP19 public dataset, MMHPSDdataset, and our EV-3DPW dataset, with further qualitative validation via aderived driving scene dataset EV-JAAD and an outdoor collection vehicle.

Previous works have shown that subtaskdecomposition within the model's context (chain of thought), is beneficial forsolving such tasks. In this work, we point a limitation of LLMs' ability toperform several sub-tasks within the same context window - an in-contexthardness of composition, pointing to an advantage for distributing a decomposedproblem in a multi-agent system of LLMs. The hardness of composition isquantified by a generation complexity metric, i.e., the number of LLMgenerations required to sample at least one correct solution. We find a gapbetween the generation complexity of solving a compositional problem within thesame context relative to distributing it among multiple agents, that increasesexponentially with the solution's length.

Although having notably narrowed the accuracy gap with LiDAR,there is still few research effort to explore the reliability in predictingsemantic occupancy from camera. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensiveevaluation of existing semantic occupancy prediction models from a reliabilityperspective for the first time. Despite the gradual alignment of camera-basedmodels with LiDAR in term of accuracy, a significant reliability gap persists.To addresses this concern, we propose ReliOcc, a method designed to enhance thereliability of camera-based occupancy networks. ReliOcc provides aplug-and-play scheme for existing models, which integrates hybrid uncertaintyfrom individual voxels with sampling-based noise and relative voxels throughmix-up learning. Besides, an uncertainty-aware calibration strategy is devisedto further enhance model reliability in offline mode. Extensive experimentsunder various settings demonstrate that ReliOcc significantly enhances modelreliability while maintaining the accuracy of both geometric and semanticpredictions.

Reference 1 showed that a phenomenological model ofsuperconducting loop neurons eliminates the need to solve the Josephson circuitequations that describe synapses and dendrites. The initial goal of the modelwas to decrease the time required for simulations, yet an additional benefit ofthe model was increased transparency of the underlying neural circuitoperations and conceptual clarity regarding the connection of loop neurons toother physical systems. Whereas the original model simplified the treatment ofthe Josephson-junction dynamics, essentially by only considering low-passversions of the dendritic outputs, the model resorted to an awkward treatmentof spikes generated by semiconductor transmitter circuits that requiredexplicitly checking for threshold crossings and distinct treatment of timesteps wherein somatic threshold is reached. Here we extend that model tosimplify the treatment of spikes coming from somas, again making use of thefact that in neural systems the downstream recipients of spike events almostalways perform low-pass filtering. We provide comparisons between the first andsecond phenomenological models, quantifying the accuracy of the additionalapproximations. We identify regions of circuit parameter space in which theextended model works well and regions where it works poorly. For some circuitparameters it is possible to represent the downstream dendritic response to asingle spike as well as coincidences or sequences of spikes, indicating themodel is not simply a reduction to rate coding. The governing equations areshown to be nearly identical to those ubiquitous in the neuroscience literaturefor modeling leaky-integrator dendrites and neurons.</description><author>Jeffrey M.

To overcome these limitations, we propose anovel disentangled 3D avatar representation named Sequentially Offset-SMPL(SO-SMPL), building upon the SMPL model. SO-SMPL represents the human body andclothes with two separate meshes but associates them with offsets to ensure thephysical alignment between the body and the clothes. Then, we design a ScoreDistillation Sampling (SDS)-based distillation framework to generate theproposed SO-SMPL representation from text prompts. Our approach not onlyachieves higher texture and geometry quality and better semantic alignment withtext prompts, but also significantly improves the visual quality of characteranimation, virtual try-on, and avatar editing.

The complexity of the underlying systems oftenmakes finding the optimal decision challenging, especially when thesafety-critical system is time-varying. Overcoming the problem of optimizing anunknown time-varying reward subject to unknown time-varying safety constraints,we propose TVSafeOpt, a new algorithm built on Bayesian optimization with aspatio-temporal kernel. The algorithm is capable of safely tracking atime-varying safe region without the need for explicit change detection.Optimality guarantees are also provided for the algorithm when the optimizationproblem becomes stationary. We show that TVSafeOpt compares favorably againstSafeOpt on synthetic data, both regarding safety and optimality.

Without a focusing lens, lenslesscameras rely on computational algorithms to recover the scenes from multiplexedmeasurements. However, current algorithms struggle with inaccurate forwardimaging models and insufficient priors to reconstruct high-quality images. Toovercome these limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage approach forconsistent and photorealistic lensless image reconstruction. The first stage ofour approach ensures data consistency by focusing on accurately reconstructingthe low-frequency content with a spatially varying deconvolution method thatadjusts to changes in the Point Spread Function (PSF) across the camera's fieldof view. The second stage enhances photorealism by incorporating a generativeprior from pre-trained diffusion models. By conditioning on the low-frequencycontent retrieved in the first stage, the diffusion model effectivelyreconstructs the high-frequency details that are typically lost in the lenslessimaging process, while also maintaining image fidelity. Our method achieves asuperior balance between data fidelity and visual quality compared to existingmethods, as demonstrated with two popular lensless systems, PhlatCam andDiffuserCam.

However, distinct patterns in human sensing,influenced by various factors or contexts, challenge generic neural networkmodel's performance due to natural distribution shifts. To address this,personalization tailors models to individual users. Yet most personalizationstudies overlook intra-user heterogeneity across contexts in sensory data,limiting intra-user generalizability. This limitation is especially critical inclinical applications, where limited data availability hampers bothgeneralizability and personalization. Notably, intra-user sensing attributesare expected to change due to external factors such as treatment progression,further complicating the challenges.This work introduces CRoP, a novel staticpersonalization approach using an off-the-shelf pre-trained model and pruningto optimize personalization and generalization. CRoP shows superiorpersonalization effectiveness and intra-user robustness across fourhuman-sensing datasets, including two from real-world health domains,highlighting its practical and social impact. Additionally, to support CRoP'sgeneralization ability and design choices, we provide empirical justificationthrough gradient inner product analysis, ablation studies, and comparisonsagainst state-of-the-art baselines.</description><author>Sawinder Kaur, Avery Gump, Jingyu Xin, Yi Xiao, Harshit Sharma, Nina R Benway, Jonathan L Preston, Asif Salekin</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 16:06:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17994v1</guid></item><item><title>MLPs Learn In-Context on Regression and Classification Tasks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15618v2</link><description>In-context learning (ICL), the remarkable ability to solve a task from onlyinput exemplars, is often assumed to be a unique hallmark of Transformermodels.

To address this issue, we propose a lifelong policy adaptation frameworknamed LoopSR, which utilizes a transformer-based encoder to project real-worldtrajectories into a latent space, and accordingly reconstruct the real-worldenvironments back in simulation for further improvement. Autoencoderarchitecture and contrastive learning methods are adopted to better extract thecharacteristics of real-world dynamics. The simulation parameters for continualtraining are derived by combining predicted parameters from the decoder withretrieved parameters from the simulation trajectory dataset.

Nonetheless, eventcameras still suffer from some amount of motion blur, especially under thesechallenging conditions, in contrary to what most think. This is attributed tothe limited bandwidth of the event sensor pixel, which is mostly proportionalto the light intensity. Thus, to ensure that event cameras can truly excel insuch conditions where it has an edge over standard cameras, it is crucial toaccount for event motion blur in downstream applications, especiallyreconstruction. However, none of the recent works on reconstructing NeuralRadiance Fields (NeRFs) from events, nor event simulators, have considered thefull effects of event motion blur. To this end, we propose, Deblur e-NeRF, anovel method to directly and effectively reconstruct blur-minimal NeRFs frommotion-blurred events generated under high-speed motion or low-lightconditions. The core component of this work is a physically-accurate pixelbandwidth model proposed to account for event motion blur under arbitrary speedand lighting conditions.

However, recent experimentalstudies have demonstrated that many machine learning problems exhibitnon-uniform smoothness, meaning the smoothness factor is a function of themodel parameter instead of a universal constant. In particular, it has beenobserved that the smoothness grows with respect to the gradient norm along thetraining trajectory. Motivated by this phenomenon, the recently introduced$(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness is a more general notion, compared to traditional$L$-smoothness, that captures such positive relationship between smoothness andgradient norm. Under this type of non-uniform smoothness, existing literaturehas designed stochastic first-order algorithms by utilizing gradient clippingtechniques to obtain the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ sample complexityfor finding an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary solution.Nevertheless, the studies of quasi-Newton methods are still lacking.Considering higher accuracy and more robustness for quasi-Newton methods, inthis paper we propose a fast stochastic quasi-Newton method when there existsnon-uniformity in smoothness. Leveraging gradient clipping and variancereduction, our algorithm can achieve the best-known$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ sample complexity and enjoys convergence speedupwith simple hyperparameter tuning.

However, thedesign of a multi-user SC system becomes more challenging because of thecomputing and communication overhead required for coordination. Existingsolutions for learning the semantic language and performing resource allocationoften fail to capture the computing and communication tradeoffs involved inmultiuser SC. To address this gap, a novel framework for decentralizedcomputing and communication resource allocation in multiuser SC systems isproposed. The challenge of efficiently allocating communication and computingresources (for reasoning) in a decentralized manner to maximize the quality oftask experience for the end users is addressed through the application ofStackelberg hyper game theory. Leveraging the concept of second-level hypergames, novel analytical formulations are developed to model misperceptions ofthe users about each other's communication and control strategies. Further,equilibrium analysis of the learned resource allocation protocols examines theconvergence of the computing and communication strategies to a localStackelberg equilibria, considering misperceptions.

However, this approach has limitations, such astraining and storing each required model separately. This paper introducesHydraViT, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by stackingattention heads to achieve a scalable ViT. By repeatedly changing the size ofthe embedded dimensions throughout each layer and their corresponding number ofattention heads in MHA during training, HydraViT induces multiple subnetworks.Thereby, HydraViT achieves adaptability across a wide spectrum of hardwareenvironments while maintaining performance. Our experimental resultsdemonstrate the efficacy of HydraViT in achieving a scalable ViT with up to 10subnetworks, covering a wide range of resource constraints. HydraViT achievesup to 5 p.p. more accuracy with the same GMACs and up to 7 p.p. more accuracywith the same throughput on ImageNet-1K compared to the baselines, making it aneffective solution for scenarios where hardware availability is diverse orvaries over time.
