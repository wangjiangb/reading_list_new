Oneway of capturing causal relationships is by utilizing Bayesian networks. There,one recovers a weighted directed acyclic graph, in which random variables arerepresented by vertices, and the weights associated with each edge representthe strengths of the causal relationships between them. This concept isextended to capture dynamic effects by introducing a dependency on past data,which may be captured by the structural equation model, which is utilized inthe present contribution to formulate a score-based learning approach. Amixed-integer quadratic program is formulated and an algorithmic solutionproposed, in which the pre-generation of exponentially many acyclicityconstraints is avoided by utilizing the so-called branch-and-cut ("lazyconstraint") method. Comparing the novel approach to the state of the art, weshow that the proposed approach turns out to produce excellent results whenapplied to small and medium-sized synthetic instances of up to 25 time-series.Lastly, two interesting applications in bio-science and finance, to which themethod is directly applied, further stress the opportunities in developinghighly accurate, globally convergent solvers that can handle modest instances.</description><author>Pavel Rytir, Ales Wodecki, Georgios Korpas, Jakub Marecek</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 12:16:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16100v2</guid></item><item><title>PROMPTHEUS: A Human-Centered Pipeline to Streamline SLRs with LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15978v2</link><description>The growing volume of academic publications poses significant challenges forresearchers conducting timely and accurate Systematic Literature Reviews,particularly in fast-evolving fields like artificial intelligence. This growthof academic literature also makes it increasingly difficult for lay people toaccess scientific knowledge effectively, meaning academic literature is oftenmisrepresented in the popular press and, more broadly, in society. TraditionalSLR methods are labor-intensive and error-prone, and they struggle to keep upwith the rapid pace of new research. To address these issues, we developed\textit{PROMPTHEUS}: an AI-driven pipeline solution that automates the SLRprocess using Large Language Models. We aimed to enhance efficiency by reducingthe manual workload while maintaining the precision and coherence required forcomprehensive literature synthesis. PROMPTHEUS automates key stages of the SLRprocess, including systematic search, data extraction, topic modeling usingBERTopic, and summarization with transformer models. Evaluations conductedacross five research domains demonstrate that PROMPTHEUS reduces review time,achieves high precision, and provides coherent topic organization, offering ascalable and effective solution for conducting literature reviews in anincreasingly crowded research landscape. In addition, such tools may reduce theincreasing mistrust in science by making summarization more accessible tolaypeople.

According to the well-known scaling law, scaling up a denseLLM enhances its capabilities, but also significantly increases thecomputational complexity. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models address that byallowing the model size to grow without substantially raising training orinference costs. Yet MoE models face challenges regarding knowledge sharingamong experts, making their performance somehow sensitive to routing accuracy.To tackle that, previous works introduced shared experts and combined theiroutputs with those of the top $K$ routed experts in an ``addition'' manner. Inthis paper, inspired by collective matrix factorization to learn sharedknowledge among data, we propose CartesianMoE, which implements more effectiveknowledge sharing among experts in more like a ``multiplication'' manner.Extensive experimental results indicate that CartesianMoE outperforms previousMoE models for building LLMs, in terms of both perplexity and downstream taskperformance. And we also find that CartesianMoE achieves better expert routingrobustness.</description><author>Zhenpeng Su, Xing Wu, Zijia Lin, Yizhe Xiong, Minxuan Lv, Guangyuan Ma, Hui Chen, Songlin Hu, Guiguang Ding</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 09:37:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16077v2</guid></item><item><title>Mini-InternVL: A Flexible-Transfer Pocket Multimodal Model with 5% Parameters and 90% Performance</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16261v2</link><description>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressiveperformance in vision-language tasks across a broad spectrum of domains.However, the large model scale and associated high computational costs posesignificant challenges for training and deploying MLLMs on consumer-grade GPUsor edge devices, thereby hindering their widespread application. In this work,we introduce Mini-InternVL, a series of MLLMs with parameters ranging from 1Bto 4B, which achieves 90% of the performance with only 5% of the parameters.This significant improvement in efficiency and effectiveness makes our modelsmore accessible and applicable in various real-world scenarios. To furtherpromote the adoption of our models, we develop a unified adaptation frameworkfor Mini-InternVL, which enables our models to transfer and outperformspecialized models in downstream tasks, including autonomous driving, medicalimages, and remote sensing. We believe that our study can provide valuableinsights and resources to advance the development of efficient and effectiveMLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVL.</description><author>Zhangwei Gao, Zhe Chen, Erfei Cui, Yiming Ren, Weiyun Wang, Jinguo Zhu, Hao Tian, Shenglong Ye, Junjun He, Xizhou Zhu, Lewei Lu, Tong Lu, Yu Qiao, Jifeng Dai, Wenhai Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 08:09:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16261v2</guid></item><item><title>Mesa-Extrapolation: A Weave Position Encoding Method for Enhanced Extrapolation in LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15859v2</link><description>Large language models (LLMs), although having revolutionized many fields,still suffer from the challenging extrapolation problem, where the inferenceability of LLMs sharply declines beyond their max training lengths. In thiswork, we conduct a theoretical analysis to better understand why No PositionEncoding (NoPE) fails outside its effective range, as well as examining thepower of Position Encoding (PE) in this context. Our findings reveal that withmeticulous weave position, PE can indeed be extended beyond effective range.Our theorems establish that LLMs equipped with weave PE can achieve improvedextrapolation performance without additional cost. Furthermore, we introduce anovel weave PE method, Mesa-Extrapolation, which utilizes a chunk-basedtriangular attention matrix and applies Stair PE to manage the final chunk.This method not only retains competitive performance but also offerssubstantial benefits such as significantly reduced memory demand and fasterinference speed. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness ofMesa-Extrapolation, demonstrating its potential as a scalable solution toenhancing LLMs applicative reach.</description><author>Xin Ma, Yang Liu, Jingjing Liu, Xiaoxu Ma</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15859v2</guid></item><item><title>Language Model Alignment in Multilingual Trolley Problems</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02273v4</link><description>We evaluate the moral alignment of large language models (LLMs) with humanpreferences in multilingual trolley problems. Building on the Moral Machineexperiment, which captures over 40 million human judgments across 200+countries, we develop a cross-lingual corpus of moral dilemma vignettes in over100 languages called MultiTP. This dataset enables the assessment of LLMs'decision-making processes in diverse linguistic contexts. Our analysis exploresthe alignment of 19 different LLMs with human judgments, capturing preferencesacross six moral dimensions: species, gender, fitness, status, age, and thenumber of lives involved. By correlating these preferences with the demographicdistribution of language speakers and examining the consistency of LLMresponses to various prompt paraphrasings, our findings provide insights intocross-lingual and ethical biases of LLMs and their intersection. We discoversignificant variance in alignment across languages, challenging the assumptionof uniform moral reasoning in AI systems and highlighting the importance ofincorporating diverse perspectives in AI ethics. The results underscore theneed for further research on the integration of multilingual dimensions inresponsible AI research to ensure fair and equitable AI interactions worldwide.Our code and data are at https://github.com/causalNLP/moralmachine</description><author>Zhijing Jin, Max Kleiman-Weiner, Giorgio Piatti, Sydney Levine, Jiarui Liu, Fernando Gonzalez, Francesco Ortu, András Strausz, Mrinmaya Sachan, Rada Mihalcea, Yejin Choi, Bernhard Schölkopf</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 06:48:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02273v4</guid></item><item><title>Granularity Matters in Long-Tail Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15980v2</link><description>Balancing training on long-tail data distributions remains a long-standingchallenge in deep learning. While methods such as re-weighting and re-samplinghelp alleviate the imbalance issue, limited sample diversity continues tohinder models from learning robust and generalizable feature representations,particularly for tail classes. In contrast to existing methods, we offer anovel perspective on long-tail learning, inspired by an observation: datasetswith finer granularity tend to be less affected by data imbalance. In thispaper, we investigate this phenomenon through both quantitative and qualitativestudies, showing that increased granularity enhances the generalization oflearned features in tail categories. Motivated by these findings, we propose amethod to increase dataset granularity through category extrapolation.Specifically, we introduce open-set auxiliary classes that are visually similarto existing ones, aiming to enhance representation learning for both head andtail classes. This forms the core contribution and insight of our approach. Toautomate the curation of auxiliary data, we leverage large language models(LLMs) as knowledge bases to search for auxiliary categories and retrieverelevant images through web crawling. To prevent the overwhelming presence ofauxiliary classes from disrupting training, we introduce a neighbor-silencingloss that encourages the model to focus on class discrimination within thetarget dataset. During inference, the classifier weights for auxiliarycategories are masked out, leaving only the target class weights for use.Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three standard long-tailbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, notably outperformingstrong baseline methods that use the same amount of data. The code will be madepublicly available.</description><author>Shizhen Zhao, Xin Wen, Jiahui Liu, Chuofan Ma, Chunfeng Yuan, Xiaojuan Qi</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 06:35:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15980v2</guid></item><item><title>CamI2V: Camera-Controlled Image-to-Video Diffusion Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15957v2</link><description>Recently, camera pose, as a user-friendly and physics-related condition, hasbeen introduced into text-to-video diffusion model for camera control. However,existing methods simply inject camera conditions through a side input. Theseapproaches neglect the inherent physical knowledge of camera pose, resulting inimprecise camera control, inconsistencies, and also poor interpretability. Inthis paper, we emphasize the necessity of integrating explicit physicalconstraints into model design. Epipolar attention is proposed for modeling allcross-frame relationships from a novel perspective of noised condition. Thisensures that features are aggregated from corresponding epipolar lines in allnoised frames, overcoming the limitations of current attention mechanisms intracking displaced features across frames, especially when features movesignificantly with the camera and become obscured by noise. Additionally, weintroduce register tokens to handle cases without intersections between frames,commonly caused by rapid camera movements, dynamic objects, or occlusions. Tosupport image-to-video, we propose the multiple guidance scale to allow forprecise control for image, text, and camera, respectively. Furthermore, weestablish a more robust and reproducible evaluation pipeline to solve theinaccuracy and instability of existing camera control measurement. We achieve a25.5% improvement in camera controllability on RealEstate10K while maintainingstrong generalization to out-of-domain images. Only 24GB and 12GB are requiredfor training and inference, respectively. We plan to release checkpoints, alongwith training and evaluation codes.

After determining alatent style for a trajectory, previous diverse policies recovering methodsusually employ a vanilla behavioral cloning learning objective conditioned onthe latent style, treating each state-action pair in the trajectory with equalimportance. Based on an observation that in many scenarios, behavioral stylesare often highly relevant with only a subset of state-action pairs, this paperpresents a new principled method in diverse polices recovery. In particular,after inferring or assigning a latent style for a trajectory, we enhance thevanilla behavioral cloning by incorporating a weighting mechanism based onpointwise mutual information. This additional weighting reflects thesignificance of each state-action pair's contribution to learning the style,thus allowing our method to focus on state-action pairs most representative ofthat style. We provide theoretical justifications for our new objective, andextensive empirical evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our method inrecovering diverse policies from expert data.</description><author>Hanlin Yang, Jian Yao, Weiming Liu, Qing Wang, Hanmin Qin, Hansheng Kong, Kirk Tang, Jiechao Xiong, Chao Yu, Kai Li, Junliang Xing, Hongwu Chen, Juchao Zhuo, Qiang Fu, Yang Wei, Haobo Fu</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 05:06:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15910v2</guid></item><item><title>Reducing Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models via Latent Space Steering</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15778v2</link><description>Hallucination poses a challenge to the deployment of large vision-languagemodels (LVLMs) in applications. Unlike in large language models (LLMs),hallucination in LVLMs often arises from misalignments between visual inputsand textual outputs. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms ofhallucination, focusing on the unique structure of LVLMs that distinguishesthem from large language models (LLMs). We identify that hallucinations oftenarise from the sensitivity of text decoders to vision inputs, a naturalphenomenon when image encoders and text decoders are pre-trained separately.Inspired by this, we introduce Visual and Textual Intervention (VTI), a noveltechnique designed to reduce hallucinations by steering latent spacerepresentations during inference to enhance the stability of vision features.As a task-agnostic test-time intervention, VTI can be easily applied to anyproblem without additional cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it caneffectively reduce hallucinations and outperform baseline methods acrossmultiple metrics, highlighting the critical role of vision feature stability inLVLMs.</description><author>Sheng Liu, Haotian Ye, Lei Xing, James Zou</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 05:01:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15778v2</guid></item><item><title>Warped Diffusion: Solving Video Inverse Problems with Image Diffusion Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16152v2</link><description>Using image models naively for solving inverse video problems often suffersfrom flickering, texture-sticking, and temporal inconsistency in generatedvideos. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we view frames as continuousfunctions in the 2D space, and videos as a sequence of continuous warpingtransformations between different frames. This perspective allows us to trainfunction space diffusion models only on images and utilize them to solvetemporally correlated inverse problems. The function space diffusion modelsneed to be equivariant with respect to the underlying spatial transformations.To ensure temporal consistency, we introduce a simple post-hoc test-timeguidance towards (self)-equivariant solutions. Our method allows us to deploystate-of-the-art latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion XL to solvevideo inverse problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method forvideo inpainting and $8\times$ video super-resolution, outperforming existingtechniques based on noise transformations.

Degenerating Non-causal Features to Plain Noise for Self-Rationalization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06003v4</link><description>An important line of research in the field of explainability is to extract asmall subset of crucial rationales from the full input. The most widely usedcriterion for rationale extraction is the maximum mutual information (MMI)criterion. However, in certain datasets, there are spurious featuresnon-causally correlated with the label and also get high mutual information,complicating the loss landscape of MMI. Although some penalty-based methodshave been developed to penalize the spurious features (e.g., invariancepenalty, intervention penalty, etc) to help MMI work better, these are merelyremedial measures. In the optimization objectives of these methods, spuriousfeatures are still distinguished from plain noise, which hinders the discoveryof causal rationales. This paper aims to develop a new criterion that treatsspurious features as plain noise, allowing the model to work on datasets richin spurious features as if it were working on clean datasets, thereby makingrationale extraction easier. We theoretically observe that removing eitherplain noise or spurious features from the input does not alter the conditionaldistribution of the remaining components relative to the task label. However,significant changes in the conditional distribution occur only when causalfeatures are eliminated. Based on this discovery, the paper proposes acriterion for \textbf{M}aximizing the \textbf{R}emaining \textbf{D}iscrepancy(MRD). Experiments on six widely used datasets show that our MRD criterionimproves rationale quality (measured by the overlap with human-annotatedrationales) by up to $10.4\%$ as compared to several recent competitive MMIvariants.

Pathological diagnosis of diseases like cancer has conventionally reliedon the evaluation of morphological features by physicians and pathologists.However, recent advancements in compute-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems aregaining significant attention as diagnostic support tools. Although theadvancement of deep learning has improved CAD significantly, segmentationmodels typically require large pixel-level annotated dataset, and such labelingis expensive. Existing studies not based on supervised approaches stillstruggle with limited generalization, and no practical approach has emergedyet. To address this issue, we present a weakly supervised semanticsegmentation (WSSS) model by combining class activation map and SegmentAnything Model (SAM)-based pseudo-labeling. For effective pretraining, we adoptthe SAM-a foundation model that is pretrained on large datasets and operates inzero-shot configurations using only coarse prompts. The proposed approachtransfer enhanced Attention Dropout Layer's knowledge to SAM, therebygenerating pseudo-labels. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposedmethod, experimental studies are conducted on histopathological breast cancerdatasets. The proposed method outperformed other WSSS methods across threedatasets, demonstrating its efficiency by achieving this with only 12GB of GPUmemory during training.

However, extending this technique to3D remains a challenge. Existing 3D drag-based editing methods, whetheremploying explicit spatial transformations or relying on implicit latentoptimization within limited-capacity 3D generative models, fall short inhandling significant topology changes or generating new textures across diverseobject categories. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MVDrag3D, anovel framework for more flexible and creative drag-based 3D editing thatleverages multi-view generation and reconstruction priors. At the core of ourapproach is the usage of a multi-view diffusion model as a strong generativeprior to perform consistent drag editing over multiple rendered views, which isfollowed by a reconstruction model that reconstructs 3D Gaussians of the editedobject. While the initial 3D Gaussians may suffer from misalignment betweendifferent views, we address this via view-specific deformation networks thatadjust the position of Gaussians to be well aligned. In addition, we propose amulti-view score function that distills generative priors from multiple viewsto further enhance the view consistency and visual quality. Extensiveexperiments demonstrate that MVDrag3D provides a precise, generative, andflexible solution for 3D drag-based editing, supporting more versatile editingeffects across various object categories and 3D representations.</description><author>Honghua Chen, Yushi Lan, Yongwei Chen, Yifan Zhou, Xingang Pan</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 17:59:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16272v1</guid></item><item><title>FrugalNeRF: Fast Convergence for Few-shot Novel View Synthesis without Learned Priors</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16271v1</link><description>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) face significant challenges in few-shotscenarios, primarily due to overfitting and long training times forhigh-fidelity rendering.

The crucial design of SAM 2 for videosegmentation is its memory module, which prompts object-aware memories fromprevious frames for current frame prediction. However, its greedy-selectionmemory design suffers from the "error accumulation" problem, where an erroredor missed mask will cascade and influence the segmentation of the subsequentframes, which limits the performance of SAM 2 toward complex long-term videos.To this end, we introduce SAM2Long, an improved training-free video objectsegmentation strategy, which considers the segmentation uncertainty within eachframe and chooses the video-level optimal results from multiple segmentationpathways in a constrained tree search manner. In practice, we maintain a fixednumber of segmentation pathways throughout the video. For each frame, multiplemasks are proposed based on the existing pathways, creating various candidatebranches. We then select the same fixed number of branches with highercumulative scores as the new pathways for the next frame. After processing thefinal frame, the pathway with the highest cumulative score is chosen as thefinal segmentation result. Benefiting from its heuristic search design,SAM2Long is robust toward occlusions and object reappearances, and caneffectively segment and track objects for complex long-term videos. Notably,SAM2Long achieves an average improvement of 3.0 points across all 24head-to-head comparisons, with gains of up to 5.3 points in J&amp;F on long-termvideo object segmentation benchmarks such as SA-V and LVOS.

Adversarialvariants of Imitation Learning and Inverse Reinforcement Learning offer analternative by learning policies from expert demonstrations via adiscriminator. However, these methods struggle in complex tasks where randomlysampling expert-like behaviors is challenging. This limitation stems from theirreliance on policy-agnostic discriminators, which provide insufficient guidancefor agent improvement, especially as task complexity increases and expertbehavior becomes more distinct. We introduce RILe (Reinforced ImitationLearning environment), a novel trainer-student system that learns a dynamicreward function based on the student's performance and alignment with expertdemonstrations. In RILe, the student learns an action policy while the trainer,using reinforcement learning, continuously updates itself via thediscriminator's feedback to optimize the alignment between the student and theexpert. The trainer optimizes for long-term cumulative rewards from thediscriminator, enabling it to provide nuanced feedback that accounts for thecomplexity of the task and the student's current capabilities. This approachallows for greater exploration of agent actions by providing graduated feedbackrather than binary expert/non-expert classifications. By reducing dependence onpolicy-agnostic discriminators, RILe enables better performance in complexsettings where traditional methods falter, outperforming existing methods by 2xin complex simulated robot-locomotion tasks.</description><author>Mert Albaba, Sammy Christen, Thomas Langarek, Christoph Gebhardt, Otmar Hilliges, Michael J.

We explore different types of temporal encoders, includinglearnable spatio-temporal pooling as well as sequential models like TokenTuring Machines. We experimentally confirm that BLIP-3-Video obtains videoquestion-answering accuracies comparable to much larger state-of-the-art models(e.g., 34B), while being much smaller (i.e., 4B) and more efficient by usingfewer visual tokens.

However, generating high-quality novel views underchallenging settings, such as sparse input views, remains difficult due toinsufficient information in under-sampled areas, often resulting in noticeableartifacts. This paper presents 3DGS-Enhancer, a novel pipeline for enhancingthe representation quality of 3DGS representations. We leverage 2D videodiffusion priors to address the challenging 3D view consistency problem,reformulating it as achieving temporal consistency within a video generationprocess. 3DGS-Enhancer restores view-consistent latent features of renderednovel views and integrates them with the input views through a spatial-temporaldecoder. The enhanced views are then used to fine-tune the initial 3DGS model,significantly improving its rendering performance. Extensive experiments onlarge-scale datasets of unbounded scenes demonstrate that 3DGS-Enhancer yieldssuperior reconstruction performance and high-fidelity rendering resultscompared to state-of-the-art methods.

Different fromprior works that rely on marker-based tracking and multiview cameras, ATSlearns natural behaviors of animal and human agents non-invasively throughvideo observations recorded over a long time-span (e.g., a month) in a singleenvironment. Modeling 3D behavior of an agent requires persistent 3D tracking(e.g., knowing which point corresponds to which) over a long time period. Toobtain such data, we develop a coarse-to-fine registration method that tracksthe agent and the camera over time through a canonical 3D space, resulting in acomplete and persistent spacetime 4D representation. We then train a generativemodel of agent behaviors using paired data of perception and motion of an agentqueried from the 4D reconstruction.

However, considering the essential differences betweentext and image modalities, the design space of language models for imagegeneration remains underexplored. We observe that image tokens exhibit greaterrandomness compared to text tokens, which presents challenges when trainingwith token prediction. Nevertheless, AR models demonstrate their potential byeffectively learning patterns even from a seemingly suboptimal optimizationproblem. Our analysis also reveals that while all models successfully grasp theimportance of local information in image generation, smaller models struggle tocapture the global context. In contrast, larger models showcase improvedcapabilities in this area, helping to explain the performance gains achievedwhen scaling up model size. We further elucidate the design space of languagemodels for vision generation, including tokenizer choice, model choice, modelscalability, vocabulary design, and sampling strategy through extensivecomparative experiments. Our work is the first to analyze the optimizationbehavior of language models in vision generation, and we believe it can inspiremore effective designs when applying LMs to other domains.

Existingmethods commonly detect structural anomalies, such as dents and scratches, byleveraging multi-scale features from image patches extracted through deeppre-trained networks. However, significant memory and computational demandsoften limit their practical application. Additionally, detecting logicalanomalies-such as images with missing or excess elements-requires anunderstanding of spatial relationships that traditional patch-based methodsfail to capture. In this work, we address these limitations by focusing on DeepFeature Reconstruction (DFR), a memory- and compute-efficient approach fordetecting structural anomalies. We further enhance DFR into a unifiedframework, called ULSAD, which is capable of detecting both structural andlogical anomalies. Specifically, we refine the DFR training objective toimprove performance in structural anomaly detection, while introducing anattention-based loss mechanism using a global autoencoder-like network tohandle logical anomaly detection. Our empirical evaluation across fivebenchmark datasets demonstrates the performance of ULSAD in detecting andlocalizing both structural and logical anomalies, outperforming eightstate-of-the-art methods. An extensive ablation study further highlights thecontribution of each component to the overall performance improvement.

Validity-constrained distributionlearning attempts to address this problem by requiring that the learneddistribution have a provably small fraction of its mass in invalid parts ofspace -- something which standard loss minimization does not always ensure. Tothis end, a learner in this model can guide the learning via "validityqueries", which allow it to ascertain the validity of individual examples.Prior work on this problem takes a worst-case stance, showing that properlearning requires an exponential number of validity queries, and demonstratingan improper algorithm which -- while generating guarantees in a wide-range ofsettings -- makes an atypical polynomial number of validity queries. In thiswork, we take a first step towards characterizing regimes where guaranteeingvalidity is easier than in the worst-case. We show that when the datadistribution lies in the model class and the log-loss is minimized, the numberof samples required to ensure validity has a weak dependence on the validityrequirement. Additionally, we show that when the validity region belongs to aVC-class, a limited number of validity queries are often sufficient.</description><author>Nick Rittler, Kamalika Chaudhuri</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 17:56:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16253v1</guid></item><item><title>Can Knowledge Editing Really Correct Hallucinations?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16251v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations, referring to thenon-factual information in generated content, despite their superior capacitiesacross tasks. Meanwhile, knowledge editing has been developed as a new popularparadigm to correct the erroneous factual knowledge encoded in LLMs with theadvantage of avoiding retraining from scratch. However, one common issue ofexisting evaluation datasets for knowledge editing is that they do not ensureLLMs actually generate hallucinated answers to the evaluation questions beforeediting. When LLMs are evaluated on such datasets after being edited bydifferent techniques, it is hard to directly adopt the performance to assessthe effectiveness of different knowledge editing methods in correctinghallucinations. Thus, the fundamental question remains insufficientlyvalidated: Can knowledge editing really correct hallucinations in LLMs? Weproposed HalluEditBench to holistically benchmark knowledge editing methods incorrecting real-world hallucinations. First, we rigorously construct a massivehallucination dataset with 9 domains, 26 topics and more than 6,000hallucinations. Then, we assess the performance of knowledge editing methods ina holistic way on five dimensions including Efficacy, Generalization,Portability, Locality, and Robustness.

A particular challenge has been to design universal initializationstrategies which provably lead to implicit regularization in gradient-descentmethods. At the same time, it has been argued by Cohen et. al. 2016 that moregeneral classes of neural networks can be captured by considering tensorfactorizations. However, in the tensor case, implicit regularization has onlybeen rigorously established for gradient flow or in the lazy training regime.In this paper, we prove the first tensor result of its kind for gradientdescent rather than gradient flow. We focus on the tubal tensor product and theassociated notion of low tubal rank, encouraged by the relevance of this modelfor image data. We establish that gradient descent in an overparametrizedtensor factorization model with a small random initialization exhibits animplicit bias towards solutions of low tubal rank. Our theoretical findings areillustrated in an extensive set of numerical simulations show-casing thedynamics predicted by our theory as well as the crucial role of using a smallrandom initialization.</description><author>Santhosh Karnik, Anna Veselovska, Mark Iwen, Felix Krahmer</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 17:52:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16247v1</guid></item><item><title>Analyzing Context Contributions in LLM-based Machine Translation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16246v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance inmachine translation (MT) and demonstrated the ability to leverage in-contextlearning through few-shot examples. However, the mechanisms by which LLMs usedifferent parts of the input context remain largely unexplored. In this work,we provide a comprehensive analysis of context utilization in MT, studying howLLMs use various context parts, such as few-shot examples and the source text,when generating translations. We highlight several key findings: (1) the sourcepart of few-shot examples appears to contribute more than its correspondingtargets, irrespective of translation direction; (2) finetuning LLMs withparallel data alters the contribution patterns of different context parts; and(3) there is a positional bias where earlier few-shot examples have highercontributions to the translated sequence. Finally, we demonstrate thatinspecting anomalous context contributions can potentially uncover pathologicaltranslations, such as hallucinations. Our findings shed light on the internalworkings of LLM-based MT which go beyond those known for standardencoder-decoder MT models.</description><author>Emmanouil Zaranis, Nuno M. Guerreiro, André F.

Here, instead of building upon point-basedmeasures of comparison, we build upon classic methods from literature on hardclustering. We generalize two information-theoretic methods of comparing hardclustering assignments to be applicable to general probabilistic representationspaces. We then propose a practical method of estimation that is based onfingerprinting a representation space with a sample of the dataset and isapplicable when the communicated information is only a handful of bits. Withunsupervised disentanglement as a motivating problem, we find informationfragments that are repeatedly contained in individual latent dimensions in VAEand InfoGAN ensembles. Then, by comparing the full latent spaces of models, wefind highly consistent information content across datasets, methods, andhyperparameters, even though there is often a point during training withsubstantial variety across repeat runs. Finally, we leverage thedifferentiability of the proposed method and perform model fusion bysynthesizing the information content of multiple weak learners, each incapableof representing the global structure of a dataset. Across the case studies, thedirect comparison of information content provides a natural basis forunderstanding the processing of information.</description><author>Kieran A.

Materials and Methods: This retrospective studyanalyzed biparametric (T2W and DW) prostate MRI sequences of 615 patients (meanage, 63.1 +/- 7 years) from four datasets acquired between 2010 and 2020:PROSTATEx challenge, Prostate158 challenge, PCaMAP trial, and an in-house(NTNU/St. Olavs Hospital) dataset. With expert annotations as ground truth, adeep radiomics model was trained, including nnU-Net segmentation of theprostate gland, voxel-wise radiomic feature extraction, extreme gradient boostclassification, and post-processing of tumor probability maps into csPCadetection maps. Training involved 5-fold cross-validation using the PROSTATEx(n=199), Prostate158 (n=138), and PCaMAP (n=78) datasets, and testing on thein-house (n=200) dataset. Patient- and lesion-level performance were comparedto PI-RADS using area under ROC curve (AUROC [95% CI]), sensitivity, andspecificity analysis. Results: On the test data, the radiologist achieved apatient-level AUROC of 0.94 [0.91-0.98] with 94% (75/80) sensitivity and 77%(92/120) specificity at PI-RADS &gt;= 3. The deep radiomics model at a tumorprobability cut-off &gt;= 0.76 achieved 0.91 [0.86-0.95] AUROC with 90% (72/80)sensitivity and 73% (87/120) specificity, not significantly different (p =0.068) from PI-RADS. On the lesion level, PI-RADS cut-off &gt;= 3 had 84% (91/108)sensitivity at 0.2 (40/200) false positives per patient, while deep radiomicsattained 68% (73/108) sensitivity at the same false positive rate.

In this paper, we propose COde assistaNt viAretrieval-augmeNted language model (CONAN), which aims to build a codeassistant by mimicking the knowledge-seeking behaviors of humans during coding.Specifically, it consists of a code structure aware retriever (CONAN-R) and adual-view code representation-based retrieval-augmented generation model(CONAN-G). CONAN-R pretrains CodeT5 using Code-Documentation Alignment andMasked Entity Prediction tasks to make language models code structure-aware andlearn effective representations for code snippets and documentation. ThenCONAN-G designs a dual-view code representation mechanism for implementing aretrieval-augmented code generation model. CONAN-G regards the codedocumentation descriptions as prompts, which help language models betterunderstand the code semantics. Our experiments show that CONAN achievesconvincing performance on different code generation tasks and significantlyoutperforms previous retrieval augmented code generation models. Our furtheranalyses show that CONAN learns tailored representations for both code snippetsand documentation by aligning code-documentation data pairs and capturingstructural semantics by masking and predicting entities in the code data.Additionally, the retrieved code snippets and documentation provide necessaryinformation from both program language and natural language to assist the codegeneration process. CONAN can also be used as an assistant for Large LanguageModels (LLMs), providing LLMs with external knowledge in shorter code documentlengths to improve their effectiveness on various code tasks. It shows theability of CONAN to extract necessary information and help filter out the noisefrom retrieved code documents.</description><author>Xinze Li, Hanbin Wang, Zhenghao Liu, Shi Yu, Shuo Wang, Shuo Wang, Yukun Yan, Yukai Fu, Yu Gu, Ge Yu</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 17:34:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16229v1</guid></item><item><title>Hypergraph: A Unified and Uniform Definition with Application to Chemical Hypergraph and More</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12235v6</link><description>The conventional definition of hypergraph has two major issues: (1) there isnot a standard definition of directed hypergraph and (2) there is not a formaldefinition of nested hypergraph. To resolve these issues, we propose a newdefinition of hypergraph that unifies the concepts of undirected, directed andnested hypergraphs, and that is uniform in using hyperedge as a singleconstruct for representing high-order correlations among things, i.e., nodesand hyperedges. Specifically, we define a hyperedge to be a simple hyperedge, anesting hyperedge, or a directed hyperedge. With this new definition, ahypergraph is nested if it has nesting hyperedge(s), and is directed if it hasdirected hyperedge(s). Otherwise, a hypergraph is a simple hypergraph. Theuniformity and power of this new definition, with visualization, shouldfacilitate the use of hypergraph for representing (hierarchical) high-ordercorrelations in general and chemical systems in particular. Graph has beenwidely used as a mathematical structure for machine learning on molecularstructures and 3D molecular geometries. However, graph has a major limitation:it can represent only pairwise correlations between nodes. Hypergraph extendsgraph with high-order correlations among nodes. This extension is significantor essential for machine learning on chemical systems. For molecules, this issignificant as it allows the direct, explicit representation of multicenterbonds and molecular substructures. For chemical reactions, this is essentialsince most chemical reactions involve multiple participants. We propose the useof chemical hypergraph, a multilevel hypergraph with simple, nesting anddirected hyperedges, as a single mathematical structure for representingchemical systems. We apply the new definition of hypergraph to chemicalhypergraph and, as simplified versions, molecular hypergraph and chemicalreaction hypergraph.</description><author>Daniel T.

In this work, we propose aunified threat model for the principled comparison of these methods. Our threatmodel combines constraints in perplexity, measuring how far a jailbreakdeviates from natural text, and computational budget, in total FLOPs. For theformer, we build an N-gram model on 1T tokens, which, in contrast tomodel-based perplexity, allows for an LLM-agnostic and inherently interpretableevaluation. We adapt popular attacks to this new, realistic threat model, withwhich we, for the first time, benchmark these attacks on equal footing. After arigorous comparison, we not only find attack success rates against safety-tunedmodern models to be lower than previously presented but also find that attacksbased on discrete optimization significantly outperform recent LLM-basedattacks. Being inherently interpretable, our threat model allows for acomprehensive analysis and comparison of jailbreak attacks. We find thateffective attacks exploit and abuse infrequent N-grams, either selectingN-grams absent from real-world text or rare ones, e.g. specific to codedatasets.</description><author>Valentyn Boreiko, Alexander Panfilov, Vaclav Voracek, Matthias Hein, Jonas Geiping</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 17:27:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16222v1</guid></item><item><title>Bidirectional Decoding: Improving Action Chunking via Closed-Loop Resampling</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17355v2</link><description>Predicting and executing a sequence of actions without intermediatereplanning, known as action chunking, is increasingly used in robot learningfrom human demonstrations. Yet, its reported effects on the learned policy areinconsistent: some studies find it crucial for achieving strong results, whileothers observe decreased performance. In this paper, we first dissect howaction chunking impacts the divergence between a learner and a demonstrator. Wefind that action chunking allows the learner to better capture the temporaldependencies in demonstrations but at the cost of reduced reactivity instochastic environments. To address this tradeoff, we propose BidirectionalDecoding (BID), a test-time inference algorithm that bridges action chunkingwith closed-loop operations. BID samples multiple predictions at each time stepand searches for the optimal one based on two criteria: (i) backward coherence,which favors samples that align with previous decisions; (ii) forward contrast,which seeks samples of high likelihood for future plans. By coupling decisionswithin and across action chunks, BID promotes consistency over time whilemaintaining reactivity to unexpected changes. Experimental results show thatBID boosts the performance of two state-of-the-art generative policies acrossseven simulation benchmarks and two real-world tasks.

These components, such as attention heads andMLPs, have been shown to capture distinct image features like shape, color ortexture. However, understanding the role of these components in arbitraryvision transformers (ViTs) is challenging. To this end, we introduce a generalframework which can identify the roles of various components in ViTs beyondCLIP. Specifically, we (a) automate the decomposition of the finalrepresentation into contributions from different model components, and (b)linearly map these contributions to CLIP space to interpret them via text.Additionally, we introduce a novel scoring function to rank components by theirimportance with respect to specific features. Applying our framework to variousViT variants (e.g. DeiT, DINO, DINOv2, Swin, MaxViT), we gain insights into theroles of different components concerning particular image features.

Previous work applying KD in the field oflarge language models (LLMs) typically focused on the post-training phase,where the student LLM learns directly from instructions and correspondingresponses generated by the teacher model. In this paper, we extend KD to thepre-training phase of LLMs, named pre-training distillation (PD). We firstconduct a preliminary experiment using GLM-4-9B as the teacher LLM to distill a1.9B parameter student LLM, validating the effectiveness of PD. Considering thekey impact factors of distillation, we systematically explore the design spaceof pre-training distillation across four aspects: logits processing, lossselection, scaling law, and offline or online logits. We conduct extensiveexperiments to explore the design space of pre-training distillation and findbetter configurations and interesting conclusions, such as larger student LLMsgenerally benefiting more from pre-training distillation, while a largerteacher LLM does not necessarily guarantee better results.

Social media provides a unique opportunity to identifydepression through user-generated posts. This systematic review evaluatesmachine learning (ML) models for depression detection on social media, focusingon biases and methodological challenges throughout the ML lifecycle. A searchof PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar identified 47 relevant studiespublished after 2010. The Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool(PROBAST) was utilized to assess methodological quality and risk of bias.Significant biases impacting model reliability and generalizability were found.There is a predominant reliance on Twitter (63.8%) and English-language content(over 90%), with most studies focusing on users from the United States andEurope. Non-probability sampling methods (approximately 80%) limitrepresentativeness. Only 23% of studies explicitly addressed linguistic nuanceslike negations, crucial for accurate sentiment analysis. Inconsistenthyperparameter tuning was observed, with only 27.7% properly tuning models.About 17% did not adequately partition data into training, validation, and testsets, risking overfitting. While 74.5% used appropriate evaluation metrics forimbalanced data, others relied on accuracy without addressing class imbalance,potentially skewing results. Reporting transparency varied, often lackingcritical methodological details. These findings highlight the need to diversifydata sources, standardize preprocessing protocols, ensure consistent modeldevelopment practices, address class imbalance, and enhance reportingtransparency.

This paper clarifies howmodern overparameterized ensembles differ from their classic underparameterizedcounterparts, using ensembles of random feature (RF) regressors as a basis fordeveloping theory. In contrast to the underparameterized regime, whereensembling typically induces regularization and increases generalization, weprove that infinite ensembles of overparameterized RF regressors becomepointwise equivalent to (single) infinite-width RF regressors. Thisequivalence, which is exact for ridgeless models and approximate for smallridge penalties, implies that overparameterized ensembles and single largemodels exhibit nearly identical generalization. As a consequence, we cancharacterize the predictive variance amongst ensemble members, and demonstratethat it quantifies the expected effects of increasing capacity rather thancapturing any conventional notion of uncertainty. Our results challenge commonassumptions about the advantages of ensembles in overparameterized settings,prompting a reconsideration of how well intuitions from underparameterizedensembles transfer to deep ensembles and the overparameterized regime.</description><author>Niclas Dern, John P.

SVI thus provides a fast andsignificantly more sample-efficient approach to Bayesian inference thantraditional (random-sampling-based) alternatives. However, the optimizationtechniques employed in existing SVI methods struggle to address problems inwhich the target distribution is high-dimensional, poorly-conditioned, ornon-convex, which severely limits the range of their practical applicability.In this paper, we propose a novel trust-region optimization approach for SVIthat successfully addresses each of these challenges. Our method builds uponprior work in SVI by leveraging conditional independences in the targetdistribution (to achieve high-dimensional scaling) and second-order information(to address poor conditioning), while additionally providing an effectiveadaptive step control procedure, which is essential for ensuring convergence onchallenging non-convex optimization problems.

This often results inlearning features of the data that are only coincidentally correlated withclass labels. Human saliency can guide network training using our proposed newcomponent of the loss function that ConveYs Brain Oversight to RaiseGeneralization (CYBORG) and penalizes the model for using non-salient regions.This mechanism produces DCNNs achieving higher accuracy and generalizationcompared to using the same training data without human salience. Experimentalresults demonstrate that CYBORG applies across multiple network architecturesand problem domains (detection of synthetic faces, iris presentation attacksand anomalies in chest X-rays), while requiring significantly less data thantraining without human saliency guidance. Visualizations show thatCYBORG-trained models' saliency is more consistent across independent trainingruns than traditionally-trained models, and also in better agreement withhumans. To lower the cost of collecting human annotations, we also exploreusing deep learning to provide automated annotations. CYBORG training of CNNsaddresses important issues such as reducing the appetite for large trainingsets, increasing interpretability, and reducing fragility by generalizingbetter to new types of data.</description><author>Aidan Boyd, Patrick Tinsley, Kevin W.

Despite their importance,existing reward model benchmarks often evaluate models by asking them todistinguish between responses generated by models of varying power. However,this approach fails to assess reward models on subtle but critical contentchanges and variations in style, resulting in a low correlation with policymodel performance. To this end, we introduce RM-Bench, a novel benchmarkdesigned to evaluate reward models based on their sensitivity to subtle contentdifferences and resistance to style biases. Extensive experiments demonstratethat RM-Bench strongly correlates with policy model performance, making it areliable reference for selecting reward models to align language modelseffectively. We evaluate nearly 40 reward models on RM-Bench. Our resultsreveal that even state-of-the-art models achieve an average performance of only46.6%, which falls short of random-level accuracy (50%) when faced with stylebias interference. These findings highlight the significant room forimprovement in current reward models.

In this work we explore a particularly stealthy form of training-timeattacks against RL -- backdoor poisoning. Here the adversary intercepts thetraining of an RL agent with the goal of reliably inducing a particular actionwhen the agent observes a pre-determined trigger at inference time. We uncovertheoretical limitations of prior work by proving their inability to generalizeacross domains and MDPs. Motivated by this, we formulate a novel poisoningattack framework which interlinks the adversary's objectives with those offinding an optimal policy -- guaranteeing attack success in the limit. Usinginsights from our theoretical analysis we develop ``SleeperNets'' as auniversal backdoor attack which exploits a newly proposed threat model andleverages dynamic reward poisoning techniques. We evaluate our attack in 6environments spanning multiple domains and demonstrate significant improvementsin attack success over existing methods, while preserving benign episodicreturn.</description><author>Ethan Rathbun, Christopher Amato, Alina Oprea</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 16:44:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20539v2</guid></item><item><title>MagicPIG: LSH Sampling for Efficient LLM Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16179v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) with long context windows have gainedsignificant attention. However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation,becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attentionapproximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight thatattention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itselfsuffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attentionis not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and valueswith the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees canprovide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-basedapproximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneoussystem based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantlyreduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracyfor diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attentioncomputation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and largerbatch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decodingthroughput by $1.9\sim3.9\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 110msdecoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with acontext of 96k tokens.

This framework facilitates the development of predictivemodels and provides openly available benchmarking datasets for healthcareresearch. We demonstrate our framework using optical coherence tomography (OCT)scans, though it is applicable across domains. Using 109,309 2D OCT scanslices, we trained an image generative model combining a variationalautoencoder and a diffusion model. Longitudinal observations were simulatedusing a nonlinear mixed effect (NLME) model from a low-dimensional space ofrandom effects. We generated 1.1M OCT scan slices paired with five sets oflongitudinal observations at controlled association levels (100%, 50%, 10%,5.26%, and 2% of between-subject variability). To assess the framework, wemodeled synthetic longitudinal observations with another NLME model, computedempirical Bayes estimates of random effects, and trained a ResNet to predictthese estimates from synthetic OCT scans. We then incorporated ResNetpredictions into the NLME model for patient-individualized predictions.Prediction accuracy on withheld data declined as intended with reducedassociation between images and longitudinal measurements. Notably, in all butthe 2% case, we achieved within 50% of the theoretical best possible predictionon withheld data, demonstrating our ability to detect even weak signals. Thisconfirms the effectiveness of our framework in generating synthetic data withcontrolled levels of association, providing a valuable tool for healthcareresearch.</description><author>Simon Deltadahl, Andreu Vall, Vijay Ivaturi, Niklas Korsbo</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 16:43:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16177v1</guid></item><item><title>Spiking Neural Networks as a Controller for Emergent Swarm Agents</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16175v1</link><description>Drones which can swarm and loiter in a certain area cost hundreds of dollars,but mosquitos can do the same and are essentially worthless. To control swarmsof low-cost robots, researchers may end up spending countless hoursbrainstorming robot configurations and policies to ``organically" createbehaviors which do not need expensive sensors and perception. Existing researchexplores the possible emergent behaviors in swarms of robots with only a binarysensor and a simple but hand-picked controller structure. Even agents in thishighly limited sensing, actuation, and computational capability class canexhibit relatively complex global behaviors such as aggregation, milling, anddispersal, but finding the local interaction rules that enable more collectivebehaviors remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates thefeasibility of training spiking neural networks to find those local interactionrules that result in particular emergent behaviors. In this paper, we focus onsimulating a specific milling behavior already known to be producible usingvery simple binary sensing and acting agents. To do this, we use evolutionaryalgorithms to evolve not only the parameters (the weights, biases, and delays)of a spiking neural network, but also its structure. To create a baseline, wealso show an evolutionary search strategy over the parameters for the incumbenthand-picked binary controller structure. Our simulations show that spikingneural networks can be evolved in binary sensing agents to form a mill.</description><author>Kevin Zhu, Connor Mattson, Shay Snyder, Ricardo Vega, Daniel S.

However, optimizing a black-box which is also a function of time(i.e., a dynamic function) $f : \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{T} \to \mathbb{R}$remains a challenge, since a dynamic Bayesian Optimization (DBO) algorithm hasto keep track of the optimum over time. This changes the nature of theoptimization problem in at least three aspects: (i) querying an arbitrary pointin $\mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{T}$ is impossible, (ii) past observationsbecome less and less relevant for keeping track of the optimum as time goes byand (iii) the DBO algorithm must have a high sampling frequency so it cancollect enough relevant observations to keep track of the optimum through time.In this paper, we design a Wasserstein distance-based criterion able toquantify the relevancy of an observation with respect to future predictions.Then, we leverage this criterion to build W-DBO, a DBO algorithm able to removeirrelevant observations from its dataset on the fly, thus maintainingsimultaneously a good predictive performance and a high sampling frequency,even in continuous-time optimization tasks with unknown horizon.

Similarity measures such as linear regression,Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), Normalized Bures Similarity (NBS), and angularProcrustes distance, are often used to quantify this similarity. However, it iscurrently unclear what drives high similarity scores and even what constitutesa "good" score. Here, we introduce a novel tool to investigate these questionsby differentiating through similarity measures to directly maximize the score.Surprisingly, we find that high similarity scores do not guarantee encodingtask-relevant information in a manner consistent with neural data; and this isparticularly acute for CKA and even some variations of cross-validated andregularized linear regression. We find no consistent threshold for a goodsimilarity score - it depends on both the measure and the dataset. In addition,synthetic datasets optimized to maximize similarity scores initially learn thehighest variance principal component of the target dataset, but some methodslike angular Procrustes capture lower variance dimensions much earlier thanmethods like CKA. To shed light on this, we mathematically derive thesensitivity of CKA, angular Procrustes, and NBS to the variance of principalcomponent dimensions, and explain the emphasis CKA places on high variancecomponents. Finally, by jointly optimizing multiple similarity measures, wecharacterize their allowable ranges and reveal that some similarity measuresare more constraining than others. While current measures offer a seeminglystraightforward way to quantify the similarity between neural systems, our workunderscores the need for careful interpretation. We hope the tools we developedwill be used by practitioners to better understand current and futuresimilarity measures.</description><author>Nathan Cloos, Moufan Li, Markus Siegel, Scott L.

This also limits the applicability of RL in real-worldscenarios. In recent years, the field of automated Reinforcement Learning(AutoRL) has grown in popularity by trying to address this issue. However,these approaches typically hinge on additional samples to selectwell-performing hyperparameters, hindering sample-efficiency and practicality.Furthermore, most AutoRL methods are heavily based on already existing AutoMLmethods, which were originally developed neglecting the additional challengesinherent to RL due to its non-stationarities. In this work, we propose a newapproach for AutoRL, called Adaptive $Q$-Network (AdaQN), that is tailored toRL to take into account the non-stationarity of the optimization procedurewithout requiring additional samples. AdaQN learns several $Q$-functions, eachone trained with different hyperparameters, which are updated online using the$Q$-function with the smallest approximation error as a shared target. Ourselection scheme simultaneously handles different hyperparameters while copingwith the non-stationarity induced by the RL optimization procedure and beingorthogonal to any critic-based RL algorithm. We demonstrate that AdaQN istheoretically sound and empirically validate it in MuJoCo control problems andAtari $2600$ games, showing benefits in sample-efficiency, overall performance,robustness to stochasticity and training stability.</description><author>Théo Vincent, Fabian Wahren, Jan Peters, Boris Belousov, Carlo D'Eramo</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 16:32:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16195v2</guid></item><item><title>From Tokens to Materials: Leveraging Language Models for Scientific Discovery</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16165v1</link><description>Exploring the predictive capabilities of language models in material scienceis an ongoing interest.

Prior attacks rely on arbitrarily largeperturbations to the agent's rewards to achieve both of these objectives -leaving them open to detection. Thus, in this work, we propose a new class ofbackdoor attacks against DRL which achieve state of the art performance whileminimally altering the agent's rewards. These "inception" attacks train theagent to associate the targeted adversarial behavior with high returns byinducing a disjunction between the agent's chosen action and the true actionexecuted in the environment during training.

However, their proficiency in spatialreasoning remains limited, despite its crucial role in tasks involvingnavigation and interaction with physical environments. Specifically, much ofthe spatial reasoning in these tasks occurs in two-dimensional (2D)environments, and our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art VLMs frequentlygenerate implausible and incorrect responses to composite spatial reasoningproblems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans can solve effortlesslyat a glance. To address this, we explore an effective approach to enhance 2Dspatial reasoning within VLMs by training the model on basic spatialcapabilities. We begin by disentangling the key components of 2D spatialreasoning: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. Ourcentral hypothesis is that mastering these basic spatial capabilities cansignificantly enhance a model's performance on composite spatial tasksrequiring advanced spatial understanding and combinatorial problem-solving. Toinvestigate this hypothesis, we introduce Sparkle, a framework that fine-tunesVLMs on these three basic spatial capabilities by synthetic data generation andtargeted supervision to form an instruction dataset for each capability. Ourexperiments demonstrate that VLMs fine-tuned with Sparkle achieve significantperformance gains, not only in the basic tasks themselves but also ingeneralizing to composite and out-of-distribution spatial reasoning tasks(e.g., improving from 13.5% to 40.0% on the shortest path problem).

In FL, a machine learning model is trained using datafrom various end-users arranged in committees across several rounds. Since suchdata can often be sensitive, a primary challenge in FL is providing privacywhile still retaining utility of the model. Differential Privacy (DP) hasbecome the main measure of privacy in the FL setting. DP comes in two flavors:central and local. In the former, a centralized server is trusted to receivethe users' raw gradients from a training step, and then perturb theiraggregation with some noise before releasing the next version of the model. Inthe latter (more private) setting, noise is applied on users' local devices,and only the aggregation of users' noisy gradients is revealed even to theserver. Great strides have been made in increasing the privacy-utilitytrade-off in the central DP setting, by utilizing the so-called matrixmechanism. However, progress has been mostly stalled in the local DP setting.In this work, we introduce the distributed matrix mechanism to achieve thebest-of-both-worlds; local DP and also better privacy-utility trade-off fromthe matrix mechanism. We accomplish this by proposing a cryptographic protocolthat securely transfers sensitive values across rounds, which makes use ofpacked secret sharing. This protocol accommodates the dynamic participation ofusers per training round required by FL, including those that may drop out fromthe computation. We provide experiments which show that our mechanism indeedsignificantly improves the privacy-utility trade-off of FL models compared toprevious local DP mechanisms, with little added overhead.</description><author>Alexander Bienstock, Ujjwal Kumar, Antigoni Polychroniadou</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 16:25:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16161v1</guid></item><item><title>A Survey on Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13116v4</link><description>In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), Knowledge Distillation (KD)emerges as a pivotal methodology for transferring advanced capabilities fromleading proprietary LLMs, such as GPT-4, to their open-source counterparts likeLLaMA and Mistral.

This paper presents acomprehensive survey of KD's role within the realm of LLM, highlighting itscritical function in imparting advanced knowledge to smaller models and itsutility in model compression and self-improvement. Our survey is meticulouslystructured around three foundational pillars: \textit{algorithm},\textit{skill}, and \textit{verticalization} -- providing a comprehensiveexamination of KD mechanisms, the enhancement of specific cognitive abilities,and their practical implications across diverse fields. Crucially, the surveynavigates the intricate interplay between data augmentation (DA) and KD,illustrating how DA emerges as a powerful paradigm within the KD framework tobolster LLMs' performance. By leveraging DA to generate context-rich,skill-specific training data, KD transcends traditional boundaries, enablingopen-source models to approximate the contextual adeptness, ethical alignment,and deep semantic insights characteristic of their proprietary counterparts.This work aims to provide an insightful guide for researchers andpractitioners, offering a detailed overview of current methodologies in KD andproposing future research directions.

A key component of agents is memory, which stores vitalinformation but is susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing research mainlyfocuses on single-agent attacks and shared memory attacks. However, real-worldscenarios often involve independent memory. In this paper, we propose theTroublemaker Makes Chaos in Honest Town (TMCHT) task, a large-scale,multi-agent, multi-topology text-based attack evaluation framework. TMCHTinvolves one attacker agent attempting to mislead an entire society of agents.We identify two major challenges in multi-agent attacks: (1) Non-complete graphstructure, (2) Large-scale systems. We attribute these challenges to aphenomenon we term toxicity disappearing. To address these issues, we proposean Adversarial Replication Contagious Jailbreak (ARCJ) method, which optimizesthe retrieval suffix to make poisoned samples more easily retrieved andoptimizes the replication suffix to make poisoned samples have contagiousability. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach in TMCHT, with 23.51%,18.95%, and 52.93% improvements in line topology, star topology, and 100-agentsettings.

This perspective allows us to trainfunction space diffusion models only on images and utilize them to solvetemporally correlated inverse problems. The function space diffusion modelsneed to be equivariant with respect to the underlying spatial transformations.To ensure temporal consistency, we introduce a simple post-hoc test-timeguidance towards (self)-equivariant solutions.

They requirelabor-intensive textual descriptions for input videos, hindering theirflexibility to adapt personal/raw videos to user specifications. This paperproposes RACCooN, a versatile and user-friendly video-to-paragraph-to-videogenerative framework that supports multiple video editing capabilities such asremoval, addition, and modification, through a unified pipeline. RACCooNconsists of two principal stages: Video-to-Paragraph (V2P) andParagraph-to-Video (P2V). In the V2P stage, we automatically describe videoscenes in well-structured natural language, capturing both the holistic contextand focused object details. Subsequently, in the P2V stage, users canoptionally refine these descriptions to guide the video diffusion model,enabling various modifications to the input video, such as removing, changingsubjects, and/or adding new objects. The proposed approach stands out fromother methods through several significant contributions: (1) RACCooN suggests amulti-granular spatiotemporal pooling strategy to generate well-structuredvideo descriptions, capturing both the broad context and object details withoutrequiring complex human annotations, simplifying precise video content editingbased on text for users. (2) Our video generative model incorporatesauto-generated narratives or instructions to enhance the quality and accuracyof the generated content. (3) RACCooN also plans to imagine new objects in agiven video, so users simply prompt the model to receive a detailed videoediting plan for complex video editing.

We study the teacher-student settingwhere a student RBM learns structured data generated by a teacher RBM. Theamount of structure in the data is controlled by adjusting the number of hiddenunits of the teacher and the correlations in the rows of the weights, a.k.a.patterns. In the absence of correlations, we validate the conjecture that theperformance is independent of the number of teacher patters and hidden units ofthe student RBMs, and we argue that the teacher-student setting can be used asa toy model for studying the lottery ticket hypothesis. Beyond this regime, wefind that the critical amount of data required to learn the teacher patternsdecreases with both their number and correlations. In both regimes, we findthat, even with an relatively large dataset, it becomes impossible to learn theteacher patterns if the inference temperature used for regularization is kepttoo low. In our framework, the student can learn teacher patterns one-to-one ormany-to-one, generalizing previous findings about the teacher-student settingwith two hidden units to any arbitrary finite number of hidden units.</description><author>Robin Thériault, Francesco Tosello, Daniele Tantari</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 16:18:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16150v1</guid></item><item><title>PODTILE: Facilitating Podcast Episode Browsing with Auto-generated Chapters</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16148v1</link><description>Listeners of long-form talk-audio content, such as podcast episodes, oftenfind it challenging to understand the overall structure and locate relevantsections. A practical solution is to divide episodes intochapters--semantically coherent segments labeled with titles and timestamps.Since most episodes on our platform at Spotify currently lack creator-providedchapters, automating the creation of chapters is essential. Scaling thechapterization of podcast episodes presents unique challenges. First, episodestend to be less structured than written texts, featuring spontaneousdiscussions with nuanced transitions. Second, the transcripts are usuallylengthy, averaging about 16,000 tokens, which necessitates efficient processingthat can preserve context. To address these challenges, we introduce PODTILE, afine-tuned encoder-decoder transformer to segment conversational data. Themodel simultaneously generates chapter transitions and titles for the inputtranscript. To preserve context, each input text is augmented with globalcontext, including the episode's title, description, and previous chaptertitles. In our intrinsic evaluation, PODTILE achieved an 11% improvement inROUGE score over the strongest baseline. Additionally, we provide insights intothe practical benefits of auto-generated chapters for listeners navigatingepisode content. Our findings indicate that auto-generated chapters serve as auseful tool for engaging with less popular podcasts.

Recent studies showthat neural networks frequently suffer from a simplicity-biased learningbehavior which leads to over-reliance on specific frequency sets, namely asfrequency shortcuts, instead of semantic information, resulting in poorgeneralization performance. Despite previous data augmentation techniquessuccessfully enhancing generalization performances, they intend to apply morefrequency shortcuts, thereby causing hallucinations of generalizationimprovement. In this paper, we aim to prevent such learning behavior ofapplying frequency shortcuts from a data-driven perspective. Given thetheoretical justification of models' biased learning behavior on differentspatial frequency components, which is based on the dataset frequencyproperties, we argue that the learning behavior on various frequency componentscould be manipulated by changing the dataset statistical structure in theFourier domain. Intuitively, as frequency shortcuts are hidden in the dominantand highly dependent frequencies of dataset structure, dynamically perturbatingthe over-reliance frequency components could prevent the application offrequency shortcuts. To this end, we propose two effective data augmentationmodules designed to collaboratively and adaptively adjust the frequencycharacteristic of the dataset, aiming to dynamically influence the learningbehavior of the model and ultimately serving as a strategy to mitigate shortcutlearning.

In practice, 2:4 sparsity oftenpossesses low actual speedups ($\leq 1.3$) and requires fixed sparse ratios,meaning that other ratios, such as 4:8, 8:16, or those exceeding 50% sparsity,do not incur any speedups on GPUs. Recent studies suggest that V:N:M sparsityis promising in addressing these limitations of 2:4 sparsity. However,regarding accuracy, the effects of V:N:M sparsity on broader Transformermodels, such as vision Transformers and large language models (LLMs), arelargely unexamined. Moreover, Some specific issues related to V:N:M sparsity,such as how to select appropriate V and M values, remain unresolved. In thisstudy, we thoroughly investigate the application of V:N:M sparsity in visionmodels and LLMs across multiple tasks, from pertaining to downstream tasks. Wepropose three key approaches to enhance the applicability and accuracy ofV:N:M-sparse Transformers, including heuristic V and M selection,V:N:M-specific channel permutation, and three-staged LoRA training techniques.Experimental results show that, with our methods, the DeiT-small achieveslossless accuracy at 64:2:5 sparsity, while the DeiT-base maintains accuracyeven at 64:2:8 sparsity. In addition, the fine-tuned LLama2-7B at 64:2:5sparsity performs comparably or better than training-free 2:4 sparsealternatives on downstream tasks. More importantly, V:N:M-sparse Transformersoffer a wider range of speedup-accuracy trade-offs compared to 2:4 sparsity.Overall, our exploration largely facilitates the V:N:M sparsity to act as atruly effective acceleration solution for Transformers in cost-sensitiveinference scenarios.</description><author>Kang Zhao, Tao Yuan, Han Bao, Zhenfeng Su, Chang Gao, Zhaofeng Sun, Zichen Liang, Liping Jing, Jianfei Chen</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 16:00:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16135v1</guid></item><item><title>Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models for Heterophilic Graphs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14134v2</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have presented significant opportunities toenhance various machine learning applications, including graph neural networks(GNNs).

Thus, enabling flexibleand efficient injection of new knowledge in LLM inference is critical. Threehigh-level options exist: (i) embedding the knowledge in LLM's weights (i.e.,fine-tuning), (ii) including the knowledge as a part of LLM's text input (i.e.,in-context learning), or (iii) injecting the KV caches of the new knowledge toLLM during prefill. This paper argues that, although fine-tuning and in-contextlearning are popular, using KV caches as the medium of knowledge couldsimultaneously enable more modular management of knowledge injection and moreefficient LLM serving with low cost and fast response. To realize thesebenefits, we envision a Knowledge Delivery Network (KDN), a new systemcomponent in LLM services that dynamically optimizes the storage, transfer, andcomposition of KV cache across LLM engines and other compute and storageresources.

Empiricalinvestigations of such questions are impeded by two major flaws of currentevaluations: (i) much of the evaluation data is contaminated, in the sense thatit has already been seen during training, and (ii) benchmark datasets do notcapture how problem proofs may be arbitrarily complex in various ways. As astep towards addressing these issues, we present a framework for evaluatingLLMs on problems with arbitrarily complex arithmetic proofs, called MathGAP.MathGAP generates problems that follow fixed proof specifications -- along withchain-of-thought reasoning annotations -- enabling systematic studies ongeneralization with respect to arithmetic proof complexity. We apply MathGAP toanalyze how in-context learning interacts with generalization to problems thathave more complex proofs. We find that among the models tested, most show asignificant decrease in performance as proofs get deeper and wider. This effectis more pronounced in complex, nonlinear proof structures, which arechallenging even for GPT-4o. Surprisingly, providing in-context examples fromthe same distribution as the test set is not always beneficial for performance.In particular, zero-shot prompting as well as demonstrating a diverse range ofexamples that are less complex than the test data sometimes yield similar orhigher accuracies.</description><author>Andreas Opedal, Haruki Shirakami, Bernhard Schölkopf, Abulhair Saparov, Mrinmaya Sachan</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 15:58:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13502v2</guid></item><item><title>Human-Agent Joint Learning for Efficient Robot Manipulation Skill Acquisition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00299v4</link><description>Employing a teleoperation system for gathering demonstrations offers thepotential for more efficient learning of robot manipulation. However,teleoperating a robot arm equipped with a dexterous hand or gripper, via ateleoperation system presents inherent challenges due to the task's highdimensionality, complexity of motion, and differences between physiologicalstructures. In this study, we introduce a novel system for joint learningbetween human operators and robots, that enables human operators to sharecontrol of a robot end-effector with a learned assistive agent, simplifies thedata collection process, and facilitates simultaneous human demonstrationcollection and robot manipulation training. As data accumulates, the assistiveagent gradually learns. Consequently, less human effort and attention arerequired, enhancing the efficiency of the data collection process. It alsoallows the human operator to adjust the control ratio to achieve a trade-offbetween manual and automated control. We conducted experiments in bothsimulated environments and physical real-world settings. Through user studiesand quantitative evaluations, it is evident that the proposed system couldenhance data collection efficiency and reduce the need for human adaptationwhile ensuring the collected data is of sufficient quality for downstreamtasks. \textit{For more details, please refer to our webpagehttps://norweig1an.github.io/HAJL.github.io/.</description><author>Shengcheng Luo, Quanquan Peng, Jun Lv, Kaiwen Hong, Katherine Rose Driggs-Campbell, Cewu Lu, Yong-Lu Li</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 15:56:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00299v4</guid></item></channel></rss>
