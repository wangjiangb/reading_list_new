These SVMsachieve a balance between margin maximization and the minimization of slack dueto outliers. Although many efforts have been dedicated to enhancing theperformance of SVMs with hinge loss, studies on $p$SVMs, soft-margin SVMs with$p$-norm hinge loss, remain relatively scarce. In this paper, we explore theproperties, performance, and training algorithms of $p$SVMs. We first derivethe generalization bound of $p$SVMs, then formulate the dual optimizationproblem, comparing it with the traditional approach. Furthermore, we discuss ageneralized version of the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm,$p$SMO, to train our $p$SVM model. Comparative experiments on various datasets,including binary and multi-class classification tasks, demonstrate theeffectiveness and advantages of our $p$SVM model and the $p$SMO method.

Previous work has largely focused on locating entity-related (oftensingle-token) facts in smaller models. However, several key questions remainunanswered: (1) How can we effectively locate query-relevant neurons incontemporary autoregressive LLMs, such as Llama and Mistral? (2) How can weaddress the challenge of long-form text generation? (3) Are there localizedknowledge regions in LLMs? In this study, we introduce Query-Relevant NeuronCluster Attribution (QRNCA), a novel architecture-agnostic framework capable ofidentifying query-relevant neurons in LLMs. QRNCA allows for the examination oflong-form answers beyond triplet facts by employing the proxy task ofmulti-choice question answering. To evaluate the effectiveness of our detectedneurons, we build two multi-choice QA datasets spanning diverse domains andlanguages. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method outperformsbaseline methods significantly. Further, analysis of neuron distributionsreveals the presence of visible localized regions, particularly withindifferent domains. Finally, we show potential applications of our detectedneurons in knowledge editing and neuron-based prediction.</description><author>Lihu Chen, Adam Dejl, Francesca Toni</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 09:25:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10868v3</guid></item><item><title>"Image, Tell me your story!" Predicting the original meta-context of visual misinformation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09939v2</link><description>To assist human fact-checkers, researchers have developed automatedapproaches for visual misinformation detection. These methods assign veracityscores by identifying inconsistencies between the image and its caption, or bydetecting forgeries in the image. However, they neglect a crucial point of thehuman fact-checking process: identifying the original meta-context of theimage. By explaining what is actually true about the image, fact-checkers canbetter detect misinformation, focus their efforts on check-worthy visualcontent, engage in counter-messaging before misinformation spreads widely, andmake their explanation more convincing. Here, we fill this gap by introducingthe task of automated image contextualization. We create 5Pils, a dataset of1,676 fact-checked images with question-answer pairs about their originalmeta-context. Annotations are based on the 5 Pillars fact-checking framework.We implement a first baseline that grounds the image in its originalmeta-context using the content of the image and textual evidence retrieved fromthe open web. Our experiments show promising results while highlighting severalopen challenges in retrieval and reasoning. We make our code and data publiclyavailable.</description><author>Jonathan Tonglet, Marie-Francine Moens, Iryna Gurevych</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 08:59:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09939v2</guid></item><item><title>PLUTUS: A Well Pre-trained Large Unified Transformer can Unveil Financial Time Series Regularities</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10111v2</link><description>Financial time series modeling is crucial for understanding and predictingmarket behaviors but faces challenges such as non-linearity, non-stationarity,and high noise levels. Traditional models struggle to capture complex patternsdue to these issues, compounded by limitations in computational resources andmodel capacity. Inspired by the success of large language models in NLP, weintroduce $\textbf{PLUTUS}$, a $\textbf{P}$re-trained $\textbf{L}$arge$\textbf{U}$nified $\textbf{T}$ransformer-based model that $\textbf{U}$nveilsregularities in financial time $\textbf{S}$eries. PLUTUS uses an invertibleembedding module with contrastive learning and autoencoder techniques to createan approximate one-to-one mapping between raw data and patch embeddings.TimeFormer, an attention based architecture, forms the core of PLUTUS,effectively modeling high-noise time series. We incorporate a novel attentionmechanisms to capture features across both variable and temporal dimensions.PLUTUS is pre-trained on an unprecedented dataset of 100 billion observations,designed to thrive in noisy financial environments. To our knowledge, PLUTUS isthe first open-source, large-scale, pre-trained financial time series modelwith over one billion parameters. It achieves state-of-the-art performance invarious tasks, demonstrating strong transferability and establishing a robustfoundational model for finance. Our research provides technical guidance forpre-training financial time series data, setting a new standard in the field.</description><author>Yuanjian Xu, Anxian Liu, Jianing Hao, Zhenzhuo Li, Shichang Meng, Guang Zhang</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 02:59:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10111v2</guid></item><item><title>LoopSplat: Loop Closure by Registering 3D Gaussian Splats</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10154v2</link><description>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) based on 3D Gaussian Splats(3DGS) has recently shown promise towards more accurate, dense 3D scene maps.However, existing 3DGS-based methods fail to address the global consistency ofthe scene via loop closure and/or global bundle adjustment. To this end, wepropose LoopSplat, which takes RGB-D images as input and performs dense mappingwith 3DGS submaps and frame-to-model tracking. LoopSplat triggers loop closureonline and computes relative loop edge constraints between submaps directly via3DGS registration, leading to improvements in efficiency and accuracy overtraditional global-to-local point cloud registration. It uses a robust posegraph optimization formulation and rigidly aligns the submaps to achieve globalconsistency. Evaluation on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD,ScanNet, and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrates competitive or superior tracking,mapping, and rendering compared to existing methods for dense RGB-D SLAM.

A benchmark's usefulnessis determined by its ability to clearly differentiate between models of varyingcapabilities (separability) and closely align with human preferences. Existingframeworks like Alpaca-Eval 2.0 LC\cite{dubois2024lengthcontrolledalpacaevalsimpleway} and Arena-Hard v0.1\cite{li2024crowdsourced} are limited by their focus on general-purpose queriesand lack of diversity across domains such as law, medicine, and multilingualcontexts. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a noveldata pipeline that curates diverse, domain-specific evaluation sets tailoredfor LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks. Our approach leverages a combination of manualcuration, semi-supervised learning to generate clusters, and stratifiedsampling to ensure balanced representation across a wide range of domains andlanguages. The resulting evaluation set, which includes 1573 samples across 14categories, demonstrates high separability (84\%) across ten top-ranked models,and agreement (84\%) with Chatbot Arena and (0.915) Spearman correlation. Theagreement values are 9\% better than Arena Hard and 20\% better than AlpacaEval2.0 LC, while the Spearman coefficient is 0.7 more than the next bestbenchmark, showcasing a significant improvement in the usefulness of thebenchmark. We further provide an open-source evaluation tool that enablesfine-grained analysis of model performance across user-defined categories,offering valuable insights for practitioners. This work contributes to theongoing effort to enhance the transparency, diversity, and effectiveness of LLMevaluation methodologies.</description><author>Ravi Raju, Swayambhoo Jain, Bo Li, Jonathan Li, Urmish Thakker</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 02:32:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08808v3</guid></item><item><title>KAN 2.0: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks Meet Science</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10205v1</link><description>A major challenge of AI + Science lies in their inherent incompatibility:today's AI is primarily based on connectionism, while science depends onsymbolism. To bridge the two worlds, we propose a framework to seamlesslysynergize Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and science. The frameworkhighlights KANs' usage for three aspects of scientific discovery: identifyingrelevant features, revealing modular structures, and discovering symbolicformulas. The synergy is bidirectional: science to KAN (incorporatingscientific knowledge into KANs), and KAN to science (extracting scientificinsights from KANs). We highlight major new functionalities in the pykanpackage: (1) MultKAN: KANs with multiplication nodes. (2) kanpiler: a KANcompiler that compiles symbolic formulas into KANs. (3) tree converter: convertKANs (or any neural networks) to tree graphs. Based on these tools, wedemonstrate KANs' capability to discover various types of physical laws,including conserved quantities, Lagrangians, symmetries, and constitutive laws.</description><author>Ziming Liu, Pingchuan Ma, Yixuan Wang, Wojciech Matusik, Max Tegmark</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 17:59:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10205v1</guid></item><item><title>Towards Quantum Federated Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09912v4</link><description>Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging interdisciplinary field thatmerges the principles of Quantum Computing (QC) and Federated Learning (FL),with the goal of leveraging quantum technologies to enhance privacy, security,and efficiency in the learning process.

Thiswork introduces CLAT, an innovative approach that mitigates adversarialoverfitting by introducing parameter efficiency into the adversarial trainingprocess, improving both clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. Instead oftuning the entire model, CLAT identifies and fine-tunes robustness-criticallayers - those predominantly learning non-robust features - while freezing theremaining model to enhance robustness. It employs dynamic critical layerselection to adapt to changes in layer criticality throughout the fine-tuningprocess. Empirically, CLAT can be applied on top of existing adversarialtraining methods, significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters byapproximately 95%, and achieves more than a 2% improvement in adversarialrobustness compared to baseline methods.</description><author>Bhavna Gopal, Huanrui Yang, Jingyang Zhang, Mark Horton, Yiran Chen</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 17:58:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10204v1</guid></item><item><title>SANER: Annotation-free Societal Attribute Neutralizer for Debiasing CLIP</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10202v1</link><description>Large-scale vision-language models, such as CLIP, are known to containharmful societal bias regarding protected attributes (e.g., gender and age). Inthis paper, we aim to address the problems of societal bias in CLIP. Althoughprevious studies have proposed to debias societal bias through adversariallearning or test-time projecting, our comprehensive study of these worksidentifies two critical limitations: 1) loss of attribute information when itis explicitly disclosed in the input and 2) use of the attribute annotationsduring debiasing process. To mitigate societal bias in CLIP and overcome theselimitations simultaneously, we introduce a simple-yet-effective debiasingmethod called SANER (societal attribute neutralizer) that eliminates attributeinformation from CLIP text features only of attribute-neutral descriptions.Experimental results show that SANER, which does not require attributeannotations and preserves original information for attribute-specificdescriptions, demonstrates superior debiasing ability than the existingmethods.</description><author>Yusuke Hirota, Min-Hung Chen, Chien-Yi Wang, Yuta Nakashima, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Ryo Hachiuma</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 17:57:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10202v1</guid></item><item><title>MeshFormer: High-Quality Mesh Generation with 3D-Guided Reconstruction Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10198v1</link><description>Open-world 3D reconstruction models have recently garnered significantattention. However, without sufficient 3D inductive bias, existing methodstypically entail expensive training costs and struggle to extract high-quality3D meshes. In this work, we introduce MeshFormer, a sparse-view reconstructionmodel that explicitly leverages 3D native structure, input guidance, andtraining supervision. Specifically, instead of using a triplane representation,we store features in 3D sparse voxels and combine transformers with 3Dconvolutions to leverage an explicit 3D structure and projective bias. Inaddition to sparse-view RGB input, we require the network to take input andgenerate corresponding normal maps. The input normal maps can be predicted by2D diffusion models, significantly aiding in the guidance and refinement of thegeometry's learning. Moreover, by combining Signed Distance Function (SDF)supervision with surface rendering, we directly learn to generate high-qualitymeshes without the need for complex multi-stage training processes. Byincorporating these explicit 3D biases, MeshFormer can be trained efficientlyand deliver high-quality textured meshes with fine-grained geometric details.It can also be integrated with 2D diffusion models to enable fastsingle-image-to-3D and text-to-3D tasks.

This paper examines thecommunication behavior of transformer models - that is, how differentparallelism schemes used in multi-node/multi-GPU DL Training communicate datain the context of transformers. We use GPT-based language models as a casestudy of the transformer architecture due to their ubiquity. We validate theempirical results obtained from our communication logs using analytical models.At a high level, our analysis reveals a need to optimize small messagepoint-to-point communication further, correlations between sequence length,per-GPU throughput, model size, and optimizations used, and where topotentially guide further optimizations in framework and HPC middleware designand optimization.</description><author>Quentin Anthony, Benjamin Michalowicz, Jacob Hatef, Lang Xu, Mustafa Abduljabbar, Aamir Shafi, Hari Subramoni, Dhabaleswar Panda</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 17:54:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10197v1</guid></item><item><title>SpaRP: Fast 3D Object Reconstruction and Pose Estimation from Sparse Views</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10195v1</link><description>Open-world 3D generation has recently attracted considerable attention. Whilemany single-image-to-3D methods have yielded visually appealing outcomes, theyoften lack sufficient controllability and tend to produce hallucinated regionsthat may not align with users' expectations. In this paper, we explore animportant scenario in which the input consists of one or a few unposed 2Dimages of a single object, with little or no overlap. We propose a novelmethod, SpaRP, to reconstruct a 3D textured mesh and estimate the relativecamera poses for these sparse-view images. SpaRP distills knowledge from 2Ddiffusion models and finetunes them to implicitly deduce the 3D spatialrelationships between the sparse views. The diffusion model is trained tojointly predict surrogate representations for camera poses and multi-viewimages of the object under known poses, integrating all information from theinput sparse views. These predictions are then leveraged to accomplish 3Dreconstruction and pose estimation, and the reconstructed 3D model can be usedto further refine the camera poses of input views. Through extensiveexperiments on three datasets, we demonstrate that our method not onlysignificantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of 3D reconstructionquality and pose prediction accuracy but also exhibits strong efficiency. Itrequires only about 20 seconds to produce a textured mesh and camera poses forthe input views.

This study investigates howconsistent metrics are at evaluating different models under different datascenarios. Analyzing over 150 data scenarios and 18 model evaluation metricsusing statistical simulation, I find that for binary classification tasks,evaluation metrics that are less influenced by prevalence offer more consistentranking of a set of different models. In particular, Area Under the ROC Curve(AUC) has smallest variance in ranking of different models. Matthew'scorrelation coefficient as a more strict measure of model performance has thesecond smallest variance. These patterns holds across a rich set of datascenarios and five commonly used machine learning models as well as a naiverandom guess model.

Recently proposed subquadratic architectures,such as Mamba, have shown promise, but have been pretrained with substantiallyless computational resources than the strongest Transformer models. In thiswork, we present a method that is able to distill a pretrained Transformerarchitecture into alternative architectures such as state space models (SSMs).The key idea to our approach is that we can view both Transformers and SSMs asapplying different forms of mixing matrices over the token sequences. We canthus progressively distill the Transformer architecture by matching differentdegrees of granularity in the SSM: first matching the mixing matricesthemselves, then the hidden units at each block, and finally the end-to-endpredictions. Our method, called MOHAWK, is able to distill a Mamba-2 variantbased on the Phi-1.5 architecture (Phi-Mamba) using only 3B tokens and a hybridversion (Hybrid Phi-Mamba) using 5B tokens. Despite using less than 1% of thetraining data typically used to train models from scratch, Phi-Mamba boastssubstantially stronger performance compared to all past open-sourcenon-Transformer models. MOHAWK allows models like SSMs to leveragecomputational resources invested in training Transformer-based architectures,highlighting a new avenue for building such models.</description><author>Aviv Bick, Kevin Y.

Fundamental symmetries, such asPoincar\'{e} invariance, allow physical laws discovered in laboratories onEarth to be extrapolated to the farthest reaches of the universe. Symmetry isessential to achieving this extrapolatory power in machine learningapplications. For example, translation invariance in image classificationallows models with fewer parameters, such as convolutional neural networks, tobe trained on smaller data sets and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Inthis paper, we provide a unifying theoretical and methodological framework forincorporating symmetry into machine learning models in three ways: 1. enforcingknown symmetry when training a model; 2. discovering unknown symmetries of agiven model or data set; and 3. promoting symmetry during training by learninga model that breaks symmetries within a user-specified group of candidates whenthere is sufficient evidence in the data. We show that these tasks can be castwithin a common mathematical framework whose central object is the Liederivative associated with fiber-linear Lie group actions on vector bundles. Weextend and unify several existing results by showing that enforcing anddiscovering symmetry are linear-algebraic tasks that are dual with respect tothe bilinear structure of the Lie derivative. We also propose a novel way topromote symmetry by introducing a class of convex regularization functionsbased on the Lie derivative and nuclear norm relaxation to penalize symmetrybreaking during training of machine learning models. We explain how these ideascan be applied to a wide range of machine learning models including basisfunction regression, dynamical systems discovery, neural networks, and neuraloperators acting on fields.</description><author>Samuel E.

Although promising,SDF-based methods often fail to capture detailed geometric structures,resulting in visible defects. By comparing SDF-based volume rendering todensity-based volume rendering, we identify two main factors within theSDF-based approach that degrade surface quality: SDF-to-density representationand geometric regularization. These factors introduce challenges that hinderthe optimization of the SDF field. To address these issues, we introduceNeuRodin, a novel two-stage neural surface reconstruction framework that notonly achieves high-fidelity surface reconstruction but also retains theflexible optimization characteristics of density-based methods.

From simple weightaveraging to more sophisticated methods like AdaMerging, model fusioneffectively improves model performance and accelerates the development of newmodels. However, potential interference between parameters of individual modelsand the lack of interpretability in the fusion progress remain significantchallenges. Existing methods often try to resolve the parameter interferenceissue by evaluating attributes of parameters, such as their magnitude or sign,or by parameter pruning. In this study, we begin by examining the fine-tuningof linear layers through the lens of subspace analysis and explicitly defineparameter interference as an optimization problem to shed light on thissubject. Subsequently, we introduce an innovative approach to model fusioncalled zero-shot Sparse MIxture of Low-rank Experts (SMILE) construction, whichallows for the upscaling of source models into an MoE model without extra dataor further training. Our approach relies on the observation that fine-tuningmostly keeps the important parts from the pre-training, but it uses lesssignificant or unused areas to adapt to new tasks. Also, the issue of parameterinterference, which is intrinsically intractable in the original parameterspace, can be managed by expanding the dimensions. We conduct extensiveexperiments across diverse scenarios, such as image classification and textgeneralization tasks, using full fine-tuning and LoRA fine-tuning, and we applyour method to large language models (CLIP models, Flan-T5 models, andMistral-7B models), highlighting the adaptability and scalability of SMILE.Code is available at https://github.com/tanganke/fusion_bench</description><author>Anke Tang, Li Shen, Yong Luo, Shuai Xie, Han Hu, Lefei Zhang, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 17:32:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10174v1</guid></item><item><title>Classical Machine Learning: Seventy Years of Algorithmic Learning Evolution</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01747v2</link><description>Machine learning (ML) has transformed numerous fields, but understanding itsfoundational research is crucial for its continued progress.

We set out tosimplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecturedesign (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit testspredictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulationtasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, weidentify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety ofcomputational primitives. We experimentally validate the resultingarchitectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scalinglaw analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters.Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimalperplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolatedproxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such ashybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer,convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) inscaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes.

Lego is a widely used platform forcombinatorial assembly, in which people use unit primitives (ie Lego bricks) tobuild highly customizable 3D objects. This paper studies sequence planning forphysical combinatorial assembly using Lego. Given the shape of the desiredobject, we want to find a sequence of actions for placing Lego bricks to buildthe target object. In particular, we aim to ensure the planned assemblysequence is physically executable. However, assembly sequence planning (ASP)for combinatorial assembly is particularly challenging due to its combinatorialnature, ie the vast number of possible combinations and complex constraints. Toaddress the challenges, we employ deep reinforcement learning to learn aconstruction policy for placing unit primitives sequentially to build thedesired object. Specifically, we design an online physics-aware action maskthat efficiently filters out invalid actions and guides policy learning. In theend, we demonstrate that the proposed method successfully plans physicallyvalid assembly sequences for constructing different Lego structures.

Watermarking algorithmsare potential solutions by embedding detectable signatures within LLM-generatedoutputs. However, current watermarking schemes lack robustness to a range ofattacks such as text substitution or manipulation, undermining theirreliability. This paper proposes a novel topic-based watermarking algorithm forLLMs, designed to enhance the robustness of watermarking in LLMs. Our approachleverages the topics extracted from input prompts or outputs of non-watermarkedLLMs in the generation process of watermarked text. We dynamically utilizetoken lists on identified topics and adjust token sampling weights accordingly.By using these topic-specific token biases, we embed a topic-sensitivewatermarking into the generated text. We outline the theoretical framework ofour topic-based watermarking algorithm and discuss its potential advantages invarious scenarios. Additionally, we explore a comprehensive range of attacksagainst watermarking algorithms, including discrete alterations, paraphrasing,and tokenizations. We demonstrate that our proposed watermarking schemeclassifies various watermarked text topics with 99.99% confidence andoutperforms existing algorithms in terms of z-score robustness and thefeasibility of modeling text degradation by potential attackers, whileconsidering the trade-offs between the benefits and losses of watermarkingLLM-generated text.</description><author>Alexander Nemecek, Yuzhou Jiang, Erman Ayday</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 17:16:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02138v3</guid></item><item><title>Structure Learning with Continuous Optimization: A Sober Look and Beyond</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02146v2</link><description>This paper investigates in which cases continuous optimization for directedacyclic graph (DAG) structure learning can and cannot perform well and why thishappens, and suggests possible directions to make the search procedure morereliable. Reisach et al.

We analyze this phenomenon for continuousapproaches assuming equal and non-equal noise variances, and show that thestatement may not hold in either case by providing counterexamples,justifications, and possible alternative explanations. We further demonstratethat nonconvexity may be a main concern especially for the non-equal noisevariances formulation, while recent advances in continuous structure learningfail to achieve improvement in this case.

Leveraging the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) inknowledge comprehension and reasoning, recent approaches have applied LLMs tosequential recommendation through language generation paradigms. These methodsconvert user behavior sequences into prompts for LLM fine-tuning, utilizingLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules to refine recommendations. However, theuniform application of LoRA across diverse user behaviors sometimes fails tocapture individual variability, leading to suboptimal performance and negativetransfer between disparate sequences. To address these challenges, we proposeInstance-wise LoRA (iLoRA), integrating LoRA with the Mixture of Experts (MoE)framework. iLoRA creates a diverse array of experts, each capturing specificaspects of user preferences, and introduces a sequence representation guidedgate function. This gate function processes historical interaction sequences togenerate enriched representations, guiding the gating network to outputcustomized expert participation weights. This tailored approach mitigatesnegative transfer and dynamically adjusts to diverse behavior patterns.Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectivenessof iLoRA, highlighting its superior performance compared to existing methods incapturing user-specific preferences and improving recommendation accuracy.</description><author>Xiaoyu Kong, Jiancan Wu, An Zhang, Leheng Sheng, Hui Lin, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 17:09:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10159v1</guid></item><item><title>LoopSplat: Loop Closure by Registering 3D Gaussian Splats</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10154v1</link><description>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) based on 3D Gaussian Splats(3DGS) has recently shown promise towards more accurate, dense 3D scene maps.However, existing 3DGS-based methods fail to address the global consistency ofthe scene via loop closure and/or global bundle adjustment.

As such, a systematic evaluation of thelong-context capabilities of LLMs in multilingual settings is crucial,specifically in the context of information retrieval. To address this gap, weintroduce the MultiLingual Needle-in-a-Haystack (MLNeedle) test, designed toassess a model's ability to retrieve relevant information (the needle) from acollection of multilingual distractor texts (the haystack). This test serves asan extension of the multilingual question-answering task, encompassing bothmonolingual and cross-lingual retrieval. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMson MLNeedle. Our findings reveal that model performance can vary significantlywith language and needle position. Specifically, we observe that modelperformance is the lowest when the needle is (i) in a language outside theEnglish language family and (ii) located in the middle of the input context.Furthermore, although some models claim a context size of $8k$ tokens orgreater, none demonstrate satisfactory cross-lingual retrieval performance asthe context length increases.

Most prior works learn motiondistributions through encoding-decoding in the latent space, which does notpreserve motion's spatial-temporal structure. While effective, these methodsoften require complex, multi-stage training and yield predictions that areinconsistent with the provided history and can be physically unrealistic. Toaddress these issues, we propose CoMusion, a single-stage, end-to-enddiffusion-based stochastic HMP framework. CoMusion is inspired from the insightthat a smooth future pose initialization improves prediction performance, astrategy not previously utilized in stochastic models but evidenced indeterministic works. To generate such initialization, CoMusion's motionpredictor starts with a Transformer-based network for initial reconstruction ofcorrupted motion. Then, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is employed torefine the prediction considering past observations in the discrete cosinetransformation (DCT) space. Our method, facilitated by the Transformer-GCNmodule design and a proposed variance scheduler, excels in predicting accurate,realistic, and consistent motions, while maintaining appropriate diversity.Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CoMusion surpassesprior methods across metrics, while demonstrating superior generation quality.Our Code is released at https://github.com/jsun57/CoMusion/ .</description><author>Jiarui Sun, Girish Chowdhary</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 16:54:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12554v3</guid></item><item><title>In-Context Learning with Representations: Contextual Generalization of Trained Transformers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10147v1</link><description>In-context learning (ICL) refers to a remarkable capability of pretrainedlarge language models, which can learn a new task given a few examples duringinference. However, theoretical understanding of ICL is largely under-explored,particularly whether transformers can be trained to generalize to unseenexamples in a prompt, which will require the model to acquire contextualknowledge of the prompt for generalization. This paper investigates thetraining dynamics of transformers by gradient descent through the lens ofnon-linear regression tasks. The contextual generalization here can be attainedvia learning the template function for each task in-context, where all templatefunctions lie in a linear space with $m$ basis functions. We analyze thetraining dynamics of one-layer multi-head transformers to in-contextly predictunlabeled inputs given partially labeled prompts, where the labels containGaussian noise and the number of examples in each prompt are not sufficient todetermine the template. Under mild assumptions, we show that the training lossfor a one-layer multi-head transformer converges linearly to a global minimum.Moreover, the transformer effectively learns to perform ridge regression overthe basis functions. To our knowledge, this study is the first provabledemonstration that transformers can learn contextual (i.e., template)information to generalize to both unseen examples and tasks when promptscontain only a small number of query-answer pairs.</description><author>Tong Yang, Yu Huang, Yingbin Liang, Yuejie Chi</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 16:47:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10147v1</guid></item><item><title>Conjectural Online Learning with First-order Beliefs in Asymmetric Information Stochastic Games</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18781v4</link><description>Asymmetric information stochastic games (AISGs) arise in many complexsocio-technical systems, such as cyber-physical systems and IT infrastructures.Existing computational methods for AISGs are primarily offline and can notadapt to equilibrium deviations.

Existingframeworks like Alpaca-Eval 2.0 LC\cite{dubois2024lengthcontrolledalpacaevalsimpleway} and Arena-Hard v0.1\cite{li2024crowdsourced} are limited by their focus on general-purpose queriesand lack of diversity across domains such as law, medicine, and multilingualcontexts.

Our approach leverages a combination of manualcuration, semi-supervised learning to generate clusters, and stratifiedsampling to ensure balanced representation across a wide range of domains andlanguages. The resulting evaluation set, which includes 1573 samples across 14categories, demonstrates high separability (84\%) across ten top-ranked models,and agreement (84\%) with Chatbot Arena and (0.915) Spearman correlation. Theagreement values are 9\% better than Arena Hard and 20\% better than AlpacaEval2.0 LC, while the Spearman coefficient is 0.7 more than the next bestbenchmark, showcasing a significant improvement in the usefulness of thebenchmark.

Although larger CNNs generally exhibit higher accuracy, theirsize can be effectively reduced by ``tensorization'' while maintainingaccuracy, namely, replacing the convolution kernels with compact decompositionssuch as Tucker, Canonical Polyadic decompositions, or quantum-inspireddecompositions such as matrix product states, and directly training the factorsin the decompositions to bias the learning towards low-rank decompositions. Butwhy doesn't tensorization seem to impact the accuracy adversely? We explorethis by assessing how \textit{truncating} the convolution kernels of\textit{dense} (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, wetruncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50pre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Wefound that kernels (especially those inside deeper layers) could often betruncated along several cuts resulting in significant loss in kernel norm butnot in classification accuracy. This suggests that such ``correlationcompression'' (underlying tensorization) is an intrinsic feature of howinformation is encoded in dense CNNs. We also found that aggressively truncatedmodels could often recover the pre-truncation accuracy after only a few epochsof re-training, suggesting that compressing the internal correlations ofconvolution layers does not often transport the model to a worse minimum. Ourresults can be applied to tensorize and compress CNN models more effectively.</description><author>Sukhbinder Singh, Saeed S.

First, we establish that robust spectral clustering withrank statistics can consistently recover latent block structure, viewed ascommunities of nodes in a graph, in the sense that unobserved communitymemberships for all but a vanishing fraction of nodes are correctly recoveredwith high probability when the data matrix is large. Second, we refine theformer result and further establish that, under certain conditions, thecommunity membership of any individual, specified node of interest can beasymptotically exactly recovered with probability tending to one in thelarge-data limit. Third, we establish asymptotic normality results associatedwith the truncated eigenstructure of matrices whose entries are rankstatistics, made possible by synthesizing contemporary entrywise matrixperturbation analysis with the classical nonparametric theory of so-calledsimple linear rank statistics. Collectively, these results demonstrate thestatistical utility of rank-based data transformations when paired withspectral techniques for dimensionality reduction. Additionally, for a datasetof human connectomes, our approach yields parsimonious dimensionality reductionand improved recovery of ground-truth neuroanatomical cluster structure.</description><author>Joshua Cape, Xianshi Yu, Jonquil Z.

However, existing works often fail to capturefine geometric details accurately and struggle with optimizing renderingquality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm thatprogressively generates and optimizes meshes from multi-view images. Ourapproach initiates with the training of a NeRF model to establish an initialSigned Distance Field (SDF) and a view-dependent appearance field.Subsequently, we iteratively refine the SDF through a differentiable meshextraction method, continuously updating both the vertex positions and theirconnectivity based on the loss from mesh differentiable rasterization, whilealso optimizing the appearance representation. To further leveragehigh-fidelity and detail-rich representations from NeRF, we propose anonline-learning strategy based on Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to enhanceviewpoints by adaptively incorporating images rendered by the initial NeRFmodel into the training dataset. Through extensive experiments, we demonstratethat our method delivers highly competitive and robust performance in both meshrendering quality and geometric quality.</description><author>Haoyang Wang, Liming Liu, Quanlu Jia, Jiangkai Wu, Haodan Zhang, Peiheng Wang, Xinggong Zhang</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 16:33:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10135v1</guid></item><item><title>Perceptual Depth Quality Assessment of Stereoscopic Omnidirectional Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10134v1</link><description>Depth perception plays an essential role in the viewer experience forimmersive virtual reality (VR) visual environments. However, previous researchinvestigations in the depth quality of 3D/stereoscopic images are ratherlimited, and in particular, are largely lacking for 3D viewing of 360-degreeomnidirectional content. In this work, we make one of the first attempts todevelop an objective quality assessment model named depth quality index (DQI)for efficient no-reference (NR) depth quality assessment of stereoscopicomnidirectional images. Motivated by the perceptual characteristics of thehuman visual system (HVS), the proposed DQI is built upon multi-color-channel,adaptive viewport selection, and interocular discrepancy features. Experimentalresults demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art imagequality assessment (IQA) and depth quality assessment (DQA) approaches inpredicting the perceptual depth quality when tested using both single-viewportand omnidirectional stereoscopic image databases. Furthermore, we demonstratethat combining the proposed depth quality model with existing IQA methodssignificantly boosts the performance in predicting the overall quality of 3Domnidirectional images.</description><author>Wei Zhou, Zhou Wang</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 16:28:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10134v1</guid></item><item><title>Rhyme-aware Chinese lyric generator based on GPT</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10130v1</link><description>Neural language representation models such as GPT, pre-trained on large-scalecorpora, can effectively capture rich semantic patterns from plain text and befine-tuned to consistently improve natural language generation performance.However, existing pre-trained language models used to generate lyrics rarelyconsider rhyme information, which is crucial in lyrics.

Speaker adaptation relies on fine-tuning amulti-speaker generative model, which involves training a separate model toinfer a new speaker embedding used for speaker encoding. Both methods canachieve excellent performance, even with a small number of cloning audios, interms of the speech's naturalness and similarity to the original speaker.Speaker encoding approaches are more appropriate for low-resource deploymentsince they require significantly less memory and have a faster cloning timethan speaker adaption, which can offer slightly greater naturalness andsimilarity. The main goal is to create a vocal cloning system that producesaudio output with a Nepali accent or that sounds like Nepali.

Inrecent years, pre-trained deep learning models have been widely applied to thistask. Some approaches that incorporate prior biological domain knowledge intothe pre-training framework have achieved impressive results. However, thesemethods heavily rely on biochemical experts, and retrieving and summarizingvast amounts of domain knowledge literature is both time-consuming andexpensive. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkableperformance in understanding and efficiently providing general knowledge.Nevertheless, they occasionally exhibit hallucinations and lack precision ingenerating domain-specific knowledge. Conversely, Domain-specific Small Models(DSMs) possess rich domain knowledge and can accurately calculate moleculardomain-related metrics. However, due to their limited model size and singularfunctionality, they lack the breadth of knowledge necessary for comprehensiverepresentation learning. To leverage the advantages of both approaches inmolecular property prediction, we propose a novel Molecular Graphrepresentation learning framework that integrates Large language models andDomain-specific small models (MolGraph-LarDo). Technically, we design atwo-stage prompt strategy where DSMs are introduced to calibrate the knowledgeprovided by LLMs, enhancing the accuracy of domain-specific information andthus enabling LLMs to generate more precise textual descriptions for molecularsamples.

A deep understanding of affordance canlead to more intelligent AI systems. For example, such knowledge directs anagent to grasp a knife by the handle for cutting and by the blade when passingit to someone. In this paper, we present a streamlined affordance learningsystem that encompasses data collection, effective model training, and robotdeployment. First, we collect training data from egocentric videos in anautomatic manner. Different from previous methods that focus only on the objectgraspable affordance and represent it as coarse heatmaps, we cover bothgraspable (e.g., object handles) and functional affordances (e.g., knifeblades, hammer heads) and extract data with precise segmentation masks. We thenpropose an effective model, termed Geometry-guided Affordance Transformer(GKT), to train on the collected data. GKT integrates an innovative DepthFeature Injector (DFI) to incorporate 3D shape and geometric priors, enhancingthe model's understanding of affordances. To enable affordance-orientedmanipulation, we further introduce Aff-Grasp, a framework that combines GKTwith a grasp generation model. For comprehensive evaluation, we create anaffordance evaluation dataset with pixel-wise annotations, and designreal-world tasks for robot experiments. The results show that GKT surpasses thestate-of-the-art by 15.9% in mIoU, and Aff-Grasp achieves high success rates of95.5% in affordance prediction and 77.1% in successful grasping among 179trials, including evaluations with seen, unseen objects, and cluttered scenes.</description><author>Gen Li, Nikolaos Tsagkas, Jifei Song, Ruaridh Mon-Williams, Sethu Vijayakumar, Kun Shao, Laura Sevilla-Lara</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 16:11:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10123v1</guid></item><item><title>Geometry Informed Tokenization of Molecules for Language Model Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10120v1</link><description>We consider molecule generation in 3D space using language models (LMs),which requires discrete tokenization of 3D molecular geometries.

Most existingworks struggle to address this problem by collecting large-scale HQ videos,which are inaccessible to the community. In this work, we show that publiclyavailable limited and low-quality (LQ) data are sufficient to train a HQ videogenerator without recaptioning or finetuning. We factorize the whole T2Vgeneration process into two steps: generating an image conditioned on a highlydescriptive caption, and synthesizing the video conditioned on the generatedimage and a concise caption of motion details. Specifically, we present\emph{Factorized-Dreamer}, a factorized spatiotemporal framework with severalcritical designs for T2V generation, including an adapter to combine text andimage embeddings, a pixel-aware cross attention module to capture pixel-levelimage information, a T5 text encoder to better understand motion description,and a PredictNet to supervise optical flows. We further present a noiseschedule, which plays a key role in ensuring the quality and stability of videogeneration. Our model lowers the requirements in detailed captions and HQvideos, and can be directly trained on limited LQ datasets with noisy and briefcaptions such as WebVid-10M, largely alleviating the cost to collectlarge-scale HQ video-text pairs.

The generated images and theoriginal text samples are further used to train multimodal teacher models basedon state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures. Finally, the knowledgefrom multimodal teachers is distilled into a text-based (unimodal) student.Hence, by employing a generative model to produce synthetic data as privilegedinformation, we guide the training of the student model. Our framework, calledLearning Using Generated Privileged Information (LUGPI), yields noticeableperformance gains on four text classification data sets, demonstrating itspotential in text classification without any additional cost during inference.</description><author>Rafael-Edy Menadil, Mariana-Iuliana Georgescu, Radu Tudor Ionescu</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 15:39:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15238v2</guid></item><item><title>Convert and Speak: Zero-shot Accent Conversion with Minimum Supervision</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10096v1</link><description>Low resource of parallel data is the key challenge of accent conversion(AC)problem in which both the pronunciation units and prosody pattern need to beconverted. We propose a two-stage generative framework "convert-and-speak" inwhich the conversion is only operated on the semantic token level and thespeech is synthesized conditioned on the converted semantic token with a speechgenerative model in target accent domain. The decoupling design enables the"speaking" module to use massive amount of target accent speech and relievesthe parallel data required for the "conversion" module. Conversion with thebridge of semantic token also relieves the requirement for the data with texttranscriptions and unlocks the usage of language pre-training technology tofurther efficiently reduce the need of parallel accent speech data. To reducethe complexity and latency of "speaking", a single-stage AR generative model isdesigned to achieve good quality as well as lower computation cost. Experimentson Indian-English to general American-English conversion show that the proposedframework achieves state-of-the-art performance in accent similarity, speechquality, and speaker maintenance with only 15 minutes of weakly parallel datawhich is not constrained to the same speaker. Extensive experimentation withdiverse accent types suggests that this framework possesses a high degree ofadaptability, making it readily scalable to accommodate other accents withlow-resource data.

The typical autoregressive decoding methodrequires a separate forward pass through the model for each token generated,which is computationally inefficient and poses challenges for deploying LLMs inlatency-sensitive scenarios. The main limitations of current decoding methodsstem from their inefficiencies and resource demands. Existing approaches eithernecessitate fine-tuning smaller models, which is resource-intensive, or rely onfixed retrieval schemes to construct drafts for the next tokens, which lackadaptability and fail to generalize across different models and contexts. Toaddress these issues, we introduce a novel methodology called ADED, whichaccelerates LLM decoding without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach involvesan adaptive draft-verification process that evolves over time to improveefficiency. We utilize a tri-gram matrix-based LLM representation todynamically approximate the output distribution of the LLM, allowing the modelto adjust to changing token probabilities during the decoding process.Additionally, we implement a draft construction mechanism that effectivelybalances exploration and exploitation, ensuring that the drafts generated areboth diverse and close to the true output distribution of the LLM. Theimportance of this design lies in its ability to optimize the draftdistribution adaptively, leading to faster and more accurate decoding. Throughextensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and LLM architectures, wedemonstrate that ADED significantly accelerates the decoding process whilemaintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for deployment in a wide range ofpractical applications.</description><author>Xukun Liu, Bowen Lei, Ruqi Zhang, Dongkuan Xu</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 15:28:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12021v2</guid></item><item><title>ARMADA: Attribute-Based Multimodal Data Augmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10086v1</link><description>In Multimodal Language Models (MLMs), the cost of manually annotatinghigh-quality image-text pair data for fine-tuning and alignment is extremelyhigh. While existing multimodal data augmentation frameworks propose ways toaugment image-text pairs, they either suffer from semantic inconsistencybetween texts and images, or generate unrealistic images, causing knowledge gapwith real world examples. To address these issues, we propose Attribute-basedMultimodal Data Augmentation (ARMADA), a novel multimodal data augmentationmethod via knowledge-guided manipulation of visual attributes of the mentionedentities. Specifically, we extract entities and their visual attributes fromthe original text data, then search for alternative values for the visualattributes under the guidance of knowledge bases (KBs) and large languagemodels (LLMs). We then utilize an image-editing model to edit the images withthe extracted attributes. ARMADA is a novel multimodal data generationframework that: (i) extracts knowledge-grounded attributes from symbolic KBsfor semantically consistent yet distinctive image-text pair generation, (ii)generates visually similar images of disparate categories using neighboringentities in the KB hierarchy, and (iii) uses the commonsense knowledge of LLMsto modulate auxiliary visual attributes such as backgrounds for more robustrepresentation of original entities. Our empirical results over four downstreamtasks demonstrate the efficacy of our framework to produce high-quality dataand enhance the model performance. This also highlights the need to leverageexternal knowledge proxies for enhanced interpretability and real-worldgrounding.</description><author>Xiaomeng Jin, Jeonghwan Kim, Yu Zhou, Kuan-Hao Huang, Te-Lin Wu, Nanyun Peng, Heng Ji</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 15:27:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10086v1</guid></item><item><title>MASALA: Model-Agnostic Surrogate Explanations by Locality Adaptation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10085v1</link><description>Existing local Explainable AI (XAI) methods, such as LIME, select a region ofthe input space in the vicinity of a given input instance, for which theyapproximate the behaviour of a model using a simpler and more interpretablesurrogate model. The size of this region is often controlled by a user-definedlocality hyperparameter. In this paper, we demonstrate the difficultiesassociated with defining a suitable locality size to capture impactful modelbehaviour, as well as the inadequacy of using a single locality size to explainall predictions. We propose a novel method, MASALA, for generatingexplanations, which automatically determines the appropriate local region ofimpactful model behaviour for each individual instance being explained. MASALAapproximates the local behaviour used by a complex model to make a predictionby fitting a linear surrogate model to a set of points which experience similarmodel behaviour. These points are found by clustering the input space intoregions of linear behavioural trends exhibited by the model. We compare thefidelity and consistency of explanations generated by our method with existinglocal XAI methods, namely LIME and CHILLI.

However, they oftenrely too heavily on \emph{local} structures and neglect \emph{global}characteristics, which can lead to significant errors in peak selection anddependency establishment. Although introducing more hyperparameters that revisedependencies can help mitigate this issue, tuning them is challenging and evenimpossible on real-world datasets. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm(TANGO) to establish local dependencies by exploiting a global-view\emph{typicality} of points, which is obtained by mining further the densitydistributions and initial dependencies. TANGO then obtains sub-clusters withthe help of the adjusted dependencies, and characterizes the similarity betweensub-clusters by incorporating path-based connectivity. It achieves finalclustering by employing graph-cut on sub-clusters, thus avoiding thechallenging selection of cluster centers. Moreover, this paper providestheoretical analysis and an efficient method for the calculation of typicality.Experimental results on several synthetic and $16$ real-world datasetsdemonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of TANGO.</description><author>Haowen Ma, Zhiguo Long, Hua Meng</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 15:26:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10084v1</guid></item><item><title>No Screening is More Efficient with Multiple Objects</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10077v1</link><description>We study efficient mechanism design for allocating multiple heterogeneousobjects.

However, currentRLHF techniques cannot account for the naturally occurring differences inindividual human preferences across a diverse population. When thesedifferences arise, traditional RLHF frameworks simply average over them,leading to inaccurate rewards and poor performance for individual subgroups. Toaddress the need for pluralistic alignment, we develop a class of multimodalRLHF methods. Our proposed techniques are based on a latent variableformulation - inferring a novel user-specific latent and learning reward modelsand policies conditioned on this latent without additional user-specific data.While conceptually simple, we show that in practice, this reward modelingrequires careful algorithmic considerations around model architecture andreward scaling. To empirically validate our proposed technique, we first showthat it can provide a way to combat underspecification in simulated controlproblems, inferring and optimizing user-specific reward functions. Next, weconduct experiments on pluralistic language datasets representing diverse userpreferences and demonstrate improved reward function accuracy. We additionallyshow the benefits of this probabilistic framework in terms of measuringuncertainty, and actively learning user preferences. This work enables learningfrom diverse populations of users with divergent preferences, an importantchallenge that naturally occurs in problems from robot learning to foundationmodel alignment.</description><author>Sriyash Poddar, Yanming Wan, Hamish Ivison, Abhishek Gupta, Natasha Jaques</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 15:18:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10075v1</guid></item><item><title>Synthesis of Reward Machines for Multi-Agent Equilibrium Design (Full Version)</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10074v1</link><description>Mechanism design is a well-established game-theoretic paradigm for designinggames to achieve desired outcomes. This paper addresses a closely related butdistinct concept, equilibrium design. Unlike mechanism design, the designer'sauthority in equilibrium design is more constrained; she can only modify theincentive structures in a given game to achieve certain outcomes without theability to create the game from scratch. We study the problem of equilibriumdesign using dynamic incentive structures, known as reward machines. We useweighted concurrent game structures for the game model, with goals (for theplayers and the designer) defined as mean-payoff objectives. We show how rewardmachines can be used to represent dynamic incentives that allocate rewards in amanner that optimises the designer's goal. We also introduce the main decisionproblem within our framework, the payoff improvement problem. This problemessentially asks whether there exists a dynamic incentive (represented by somereward machine) that can improve the designer's payoff by more than a giventhreshold value. We present two variants of the problem: strong and weak. Wedemonstrate that both can be solved in polynomial time using a Turing machineequipped with an NP oracle. Furthermore, we also establish that these variantsare either NP-hard or coNP-hard. Finally, we show how to synthesise thecorresponding reward machine if it exists.</description><author>Muhammad Najib, Giuseppe Perelli</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 15:17:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10074v1</guid></item><item><title>Modelling the Distribution of Human Motion for Sign Language Assessment</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10073v1</link><description>Sign Language Assessment (SLA) tools are useful to aid in language learningand are underdeveloped.

However, the unknown and diverse forgery techniques,varied facial features and complex environmental factors pose significantchallenges for face forgery analysis. Existing datasets lack descriptions ofthese aspects, making it difficult for models to distinguish between real andforged faces using only visual information amid various confounding factors. Inaddition, existing methods do not yield user-friendly and explainable results,complicating the understanding of the model's decision-making process.

However, for lymph node segmentation, these datasets aretypically small due to the extensive time and expertise required to annotatethe numerous lymph nodes in 3D CT scans. Weakly-supervised learning, whichleverages incomplete or noisy annotations, has recently gained interest in themedical imaging community as a potential solution. Despite the variety ofweakly-supervised techniques proposed, most have been validated only on privatedatasets or small publicly available datasets. To address this limitation, theMediastinal Lymph Node Quantification (LNQ) challenge was organized inconjunction with the 26th International Conference on Medical Image Computingand Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2023). This challenge aimed toadvance weakly-supervised segmentation methods by providing a new, partiallyannotated dataset and a robust evaluation framework. A total of 16 teams from 5countries submitted predictions to the validation leaderboard, and 6 teams from3 countries participated in the evaluation phase. The results highlighted boththe potential and the current limitations of weakly-supervised approaches. Onone hand, weakly-supervised approaches obtained relatively good performancewith a median Dice score of $61.0\%$. On the other hand, top-ranked teams, witha median Dice score exceeding $70\%$, boosted their performance by leveragingsmaller but fully annotated datasets to combine weak supervision and fullsupervision.

Accurate medical image segmentationdemands deep learning models with robust capabilities in multi-scale andboundary feature learning. However, previous networks still have limitations inaddressing the above issues. Firstly, previous networks simultaneously fusemulti-level features or employ deep supervision to enhance multi-scalelearning. However, this may lead to feature redundancy and excessivecomputational overhead, which is not conducive to network training and clinicaldeployment. Secondly, the majority of medical image segmentation networksexclusively learn features in the spatial domain, disregarding the abundantglobal information in the frequency domain. This results in a bias towardslow-frequency components, neglecting crucial high-frequency information. Toaddress these problems, we introduce SF-UNet, a spatial-frequency dual-domainattention network. It comprises two main components: the Multi-scaleProgressive Channel Attention (MPCA) block, which progressively extractmulti-scale features across adjacent encoder layers, and the lightweightFrequency-Spatial Attention (FSA) block, with only 0.05M parameters, enablingconcurrent learning of texture and boundary features from both spatial andfrequency domains. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed SF-UNet onthree public datasets. Experimental results show that compared to previousstate-of-the-art (SOTA) medical image segmentation networks, SF-UNet achievesthe best performance, and achieves up to 9.4\% and 10.78\% improvement in DSCand IOU.

Initially, we pretrain models on a largedataset with weak labels (N=50k) or masked texture maps generated throughcomputer vision techniques, without human intervention. Subsequently, wefinetune the models using human-labeled data (N=1k), which consists of manuallylabeled wrinkle masks.

This scale can be achieved via a combination of factors, thealgorithm's ability to make use of large amounts of data and computationalresources and the efficient exploration of the environment for viable solutions(i.e. policies). In this work, we investigate and motivate some theoretical foundations fordeep reinforcement learning. We start with exact dynamic programming and workour way up to stochastic approximations and stochastic approximations for amodel-free scenario, which forms the theoretical basis of modern reinforcementlearning. We present an overview of this highly varied and rapidly changingfield from the perspective of Approximate Dynamic Programming. We then focusour study on the short-comings with respect to exploration of the cornerstoneapproaches (i.e. DQN, DDQN, A2C) in deep reinforcement learning.

Computer science researchers, on theother hand, commonly study privacy issues through privacy attacks and defenseson segmented fields. Privacy research is conducted on various sub-fields,including Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and ComputerNetworks. Within each field, privacy has its own formulation. Though pioneeringworks on attacks and defenses reveal sensitive privacy issues, they arenarrowly trapped and cannot fully cover people's actual privacy concerns.Consequently, the research on general and human-centric privacy researchremains rather unexplored. In this paper, we formulate the privacy issue as areasoning problem rather than simple pattern matching. We ground on theContextual Integrity (CI) theory which posits that people's perceptions ofprivacy are highly correlated with the corresponding social context. Based onsuch an assumption, we develop the first comprehensive checklist that coverssocial identities, private attributes, and existing privacy regulations. Unlikeprior works on CI that either cover limited expert annotated norms or modelincomplete social context, our proposed privacy checklist uses the whole HealthInsurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) as an example, toshow that we can resort to large language models (LLMs) to completely cover theHIPAA's regulations.

The distribution shift betweenthe two settings leads to biased representations of the dynamics, and thus tosuboptimal predictions in the real-world environment. In this work, we tacklethe challenge of sim-to-real transfer of reinforcement learning (RL) agents forcoverage path planning (CPP). In CPP, the task is for a robot to find a paththat covers every point of a confined area. Specifically, we consider the casewhere the environment is unknown, and the agent needs to plan the path onlinewhile mapping the environment. We bridge the sim-to-real gap through asemi-virtual environment, including a real robot and real-time aspects, whileutilizing a simulated sensor and obstacles to enable environment randomizationand automated episode resetting. We investigate what level of fine-tuning isneeded for adapting to a realistic setting, comparing to an agent trainedsolely in simulation. We find that a high inference frequency allowsfirst-order Markovian policies to transfer directly from simulation, whilehigher-order policies can be fine-tuned to further reduce the sim-to-real gap.Moreover, they can operate at a lower frequency, thus reducing computationalrequirements. In both cases, our approaches transfer state-of-the-art resultsfrom simulation to the real domain, where direct learning would take in theorder of weeks with manual interaction, that is, it would be completelyinfeasible.</description><author>Arvi Jonnarth, Ola Johansson, Michael Felsberg</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 14:45:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04920v2</guid></item><item><title>MagicFace: Training-free Universal-Style Human Image Customized Synthesis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07433v3</link><description>Current state-of-the-art methods for human image customized synthesistypically require tedious training on large-scale datasets. In such cases, theyare prone to overfitting and struggle to personalize individuals of unseenstyles. Moreover, these methods extensively focus on single-concept human imagesynthesis and lack the flexibility needed for customizing individuals withmultiple given concepts, thereby impeding their broader practical application.To this end, we propose MagicFace, a novel training-free method foruniversal-style human image personalized synthesis, enabling multi-conceptcustomization by accurately integrating reference concept features into theirlatent generated region at the pixel level. Specifically, MagicFace introducesa coarse-to-fine generation pipeline, involving two sequential stages: semanticlayout construction and concept feature injection. This is achieved by ourReference-aware Self-Attention (RSA) and Region-grouped Blend Attention (RBA)mechanisms. In the first stage, RSA enables the latent image to query featuresfrom all reference concepts simultaneously, extracting the overall semanticunderstanding to facilitate the initial semantic layout establishment. In thesecond stage, we employ an attention-based semantic segmentation method topinpoint the latent generated regions of all concepts at each step. Followingthis, RBA divides the pixels of the latent image into semantic groups, witheach group querying fine-grained features from the corresponding referenceconcept, which ensures precise attribute alignment and feature injection.Throughout the generation process, a weighted mask strategy is employed toensure the model focuses more on the reference concepts. Extensive experimentsdemonstrate the superiority of MagicFace in both human-centric subject-to-imagesynthesis and multi-concept human image customization.</description><author>Yibin Wang, Weizhong Zhang, Cheng Jin</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 14:43:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07433v3</guid></item><item><title>A fuzzy loss for ontology classification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02083v2</link><description>Deep learning models are often unaware of the inherent constraints of thetask they are applied to.

We propose TED pruning, a method that addresses the challenge ofoverfitting under high pruning ratios by quantifying the model's ability toimprove performance on pruned data while fitting retained data, known asInternal Generalization (IG). TED uses an optimization objective based onInternal Generalization Distance (IGD), measuring changes in IG before andafter pruning to align with true generalization performance and achieveimplicit regularization. The IGD optimization objective was verified to allowthe model to achieve the smallest upper bound on generalization error. Theimpact of small mask fluctuations on IG is studied through masks and Taylorapproximation, and fast estimation of IGD is enabled. In analyzing continuoustraining dynamics, the prior effect of IGD is validated, and a progressivepruning strategy is proposed.

It leverages deepbusiness domain expertise to create a group of virtual human expert (VHE)agents with different "schools of thought" on how to create high-qualityschedules. By computerizing them into algorithms, P-O generates many validschedules at far higher speeds than human schedulers are capable of. Initially,these schedules can also be local optimum peaks far away from high-qualityschedules. By submitting these schedules to a reinforced machine learningalgorithm (RL), P-O learns the weaknesses and strengths of each VHE schedule,and accordingly derives reward and punishment changes in the Demand Set thatwill modify the relative priorities for time and resource allocation that jobsreceived in the prior iteration that led to the current state of the schedule.These cause the core logic of the VHE algorithms to explore, in the subsequentiteration, substantially different parts of the schedules universe andpotentially find higher-quality schedules. Using the hill climbing analogy,this may be viewed as a big jump, shifting from a given local peak to a farawaypromising start point equipped with knowledge embedded in the demand set forfuture iterations. This is a fundamental difference from most contemporaryalgorithms, which spend considerable time on local micro-steps restricted tothe neighbourhoods of local peaks they visit. This difference enables abreakthrough in scale and performance for fully automatic manufacturingscheduling in complex organizations. The P-O algorithm is at the heart ofPlataine Scheduler that, in one click, routinely schedules 30,000-50,000 tasksfor real-life complex manufacturing operations.</description><author>Moshe BenBassat</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 14:32:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10040v1</guid></item><item><title>MSDiagnosis: An EMR-based Dataset for Clinical Multi-Step Diagnosis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10039v1</link><description>Clinical diagnosis is critical in medical practice, typically requiring acontinuous and evolving process that includes primary diagnosis, differentialdiagnosis, and final diagnosis.

In this paper, we explore the concept oftest-time prompt tuning (TTPT), which facilitates the adaptation of the CLIPmodel to novel downstream tasks through a one-step unsupervised optimizationthat involves only test samples. Inspired by in-context learning in naturallanguage processing (NLP), we propose In-Context Prompt Learning (InCPL) fortest-time visual recognition tasks, which empowers a pre-trainedvision-language model with labeled examples as context information ondownstream task. Specifically, InCPL associates a new test sample with very fewlabeled examples (sometimes just one) as context information, enabling reliablelabel estimation for the test sample and facilitating model adaptation. Toachieve this, InCPL employs an efficient language-to-vision translator toexplore the textual prior information for visual prompt learning. Further, weintroduce a context-aware unsupervised loss to optimize visual prompts tailoredto test samples. Finally, we design a cyclic learning strategy for visual andtextual prompts to ensure mutual synergy across different modalities.

In thispaper, we study fine-tuning through the lens of memorization capacity. Our newmeasure, the Fine-Tuning Capacity (FTC), is defined as the maximum number ofsamples a neural network can fine-tune, or equivalently, as the minimum numberof neurons ($m$) needed to arbitrarily change $N$ labels among $K$ samplesconsidered in the fine-tuning process. In essence, FTC extends the memorizationcapacity concept to the fine-tuning scenario. We analyze FTC for the additivefine-tuning scenario where the fine-tuned network is defined as the summationof the frozen pre-trained network $f$ and a neural network $g$ (with $m$neurons) designed for fine-tuning. When $g$ is a ReLU network with either 2 or3 layers, we obtain tight upper and lower bounds on FTC; we show that $N$samples can be fine-tuned with $m=\Theta(N)$ neurons for 2-layer networks, andwith $m=\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ neurons for 3-layer networks, no matter how large $K$is.

Nevertheless, these networks arevulnerable to adversarial attacks that add imperceptible perturbations to theinput image, leading to false predictions. This vulnerability is particularlydangerous in safety-critical applications like automated driving. Whileadversarial examples and defense strategies are well-researched in the contextof image classification, there is comparatively less research focused onsemantic segmentation. Recently, we have proposed an uncertainty-based methodfor detecting adversarial attacks on neural networks for semantic segmentation.We observed that uncertainty, as measured by the entropy of the outputdistribution, behaves differently on clean versus adversely perturbed images,and we utilize this property to differentiate between the two. In this extendedversion of our work, we conduct a detailed analysis of uncertainty-baseddetection of adversarial attacks including a diverse set of adversarial attacksand various state-of-the-art neural networks.

To this end, we developa deterministic policy gradient primal-dual method to find an optimaldeterministic policy with non-asymptotic convergence. Specifically, we leverageregularization of the Lagrangian of the constrained MDP to propose adeterministic policy gradient primal-dual (D-PGPD) algorithm that updates thedeterministic policy via a quadratic-regularized gradient ascent step and thedual variable via a quadratic-regularized gradient descent step. We prove thatthe primal-dual iterates of D-PGPD converge at a sub-linear rate to an optimalregularized primal-dual pair. We instantiate D-PGPD with function approximationand prove that the primal-dual iterates of D-PGPD converge at a sub-linear rateto an optimal regularized primal-dual pair, up to a function approximationerror. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in twocontinuous control problems: robot navigation and fluid control.
