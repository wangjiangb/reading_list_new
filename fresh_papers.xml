We introduce the first theoreticalframework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering samplingdynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) throughstochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement ascontrol over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnosticalgorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the basevelocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweightfine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signalwhile preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies priorattention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusioncorrespondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designedfor multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, andStable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subjectalignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runsefficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limitedprompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow OptimalControl for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-artmulti-subject fidelity across models.</description><author>Eric Tillmann Bill, Enis Simsar, Thomas Hofmann</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:59:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02315v1</guid></item><item><title>StealthAttack: Robust 3D Gaussian Splatting Poisoning via Density-Guided Illusions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02314v1</link><description>3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3DGaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. Asthese methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomescritical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks andpropose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategicallyinjects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel DensityEstimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearlyvisible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-viewconsistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-basedevaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enablingobjective benchmarking for future research.

However, severalkey questions remain unresolved: the rationale behind its log-ratio reward, howthe statistical structure of preference datasets shapes its training dynamics,and how those dynamics impact downstream capabilities. We approach thesequestions from a Bayesian perspective, interpreting the goal of preferenceoptimization as learning the differential information required to update areference policy into a target policy. To formalize this view, we introduce theDifferential Information Distribution (DID), defined as the distribution oversamples that carry the Bayesian evidence required to update policies. Weintroduce three complementary insights by viewing preference optimizationthrough the DID. First, we find that DPO's log-ratio reward is uniquelyjustified when preferences encode the Differential Information needed to updatea reference policy into the target policy. Second, we discuss how commonlyobserved training dynamics in DPO, including changes in log-likelihood andpolicy exploration, stem from a power-law DID relationship. Finally, we analyzehow training dynamics influence downstream performance using the entropy ofDID, a principled measure of uncertainty in the learned information. We observethat learning high-entropy DID improves open-ended instruction-following, whilelow-entropy DID benefits knowledge-intensive QA. Taken together, our resultsshow that DPO's reward design, training dynamics, and downstream capabilitiesall emerge as natural consequences of learning Differential Information,offering both a principled theoretical foundation and practical guidance forpreference-based alignment.</description><author>Yunjae Won, Hyunji Lee, Hyeonbin Hwang, Minjoon Seo</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:59:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23761v2</guid></item><item><title>Clink! Chop! Thud! -- Learning Object Sounds from Real-World Interactions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02313v1</link><description>Can a model distinguish between the sound of a spoon hitting a hardwood floorversus a carpeted one? Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique tothe objects involved. We introduce the sounding object detection task toevaluate a model's ability to link these sounds to the objects directlyinvolved. Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware frameworklearns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centricapproach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masksof the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards themost informative regions of the interaction. A slot attention visual encoder isused to further enforce an object prior. We demonstrate state of the artperformance on our new task along with existing multimodal action understandingtasks.</description><author>Mengyu Yang, Yiming Chen, Haozheng Pei, Siddhant Agarwal, Arun Balajee Vasudevan, James Hays</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:59:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02313v1</guid></item><item><title>KaVa: Latent Reasoning via Compressed KV-Cache Distillation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02312v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems withexplicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significantcomputational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylisticartifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative thatinternalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack ofsupervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoningtraces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges thisgap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacherinto a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging therepresentational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KVtrajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge withincompressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as arich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, theapproach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedlysmaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scalesto larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establishcompressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latentreasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiencyand deployability of latent inference.</description><author>Anna Kuzina, Maciej Pioro, Paul N.

Morespecifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal informationto be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid,and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we makethe following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for eachphysical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as wellas a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to inferthe physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply thevisual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computervision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt andtrainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative andself-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal LargeLanguage Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained ina generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, thoughbehind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the othermodels, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.</description><author>Guanqi Zhan, Xianzheng Ma, Weidi Xie, Andrew Zisserman</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:59:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02311v1</guid></item><item><title>Robust Tangent Space Estimation via Laplacian Eigenvector Gradient Orthogonalization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02308v1</link><description>Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem indata analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off inchoosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires priorknowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are oftenunavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian EigenvectorGradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of thedata to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely onlocal neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point byorthogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graphLaplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, adifferential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold showsthat gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube alignclosely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with highgradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.Second, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequencyeigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensiveexperiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that aresignificantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in markedimprovements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection,and local intrinsic dimension estimation.</description><author>Dhruv Kohli, Sawyer J.

High-resolution text-to-image generators arecurrently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternativeto their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a keytechnical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle thislimitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects acrossresolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signalfrom lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to atrain-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method thatrecalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule andis compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, StableDiffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantlyimproved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, andFlux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These resultsdemonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependentartifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.</description><author>Ruozhen He, Moayed Haji-Ali, Ziyan Yang, Vicente Ordonez</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:59:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02307v1</guid></item><item><title>Drawing Conclusions from Draws: Rethinking Preference Semantics in Arena-Style LLM Evaluation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02306v1</link><description>In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respondto a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. Theprevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles astwo-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and itsderivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal andhence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture thatdraws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, thenboth models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arenadatasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relativeincrease in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for allfour rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more forqueries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsiderexisting draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.</description><author>Raphael Tang, Crystina Zhang, Wenyan Li, Carmen Lai, Pontus Stenetorp, Yao Lu</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:59:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02306v1</guid></item><item><title>Diffusion Models and the Manifold Hypothesis: Log-Domain Smoothing is Geometry Adaptive</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02305v1</link><description>Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstratingremarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, themechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partiallyunderstood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributesthis success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structurewithin the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing onhow such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problemthrough score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation byinvestigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical scorematching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm thatsmoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-densitydomain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, weshow that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can becontrolled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.</description><author>Tyler Farghly, Peter Potaptchik, Samuel Howard, George Deligiannidis, Jakiw Pidstrigach</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:59:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02305v1</guid></item><item><title>Knowledge Distillation Detection for Open-weights Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02302v1</link><description>We propose the task of knowledge distillation detection, which aims todetermine whether a student model has been distilled from a given teacher,under a practical setting where only the student's weights and the teacher'sAPI are available. This problem is motivated by growing concerns about modelprovenance and unauthorized replication through distillation. To address thistask, we introduce a model-agnostic framework that combines data-free inputsynthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation. Ourapproach is applicable to both classification and generative models.Experiments on diverse architectures for image classification and text-to-imagegeneration show that our method improves detection accuracy over the strongestbaselines by 59.6% on CIFAR-10, 71.2% on ImageNet, and 20.0% for text-to-imagegeneration.

EqM discards thenon-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion andflow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of animplicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt anoptimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples areobtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable stepsizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generationperformance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 onImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn andsample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible frameworkthat naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OODdetection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities witha unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow andenergy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.</description><author>Runqian Wang, Yilun Du</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:59:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02300v1</guid></item><item><title>Interactive Training: Feedback-Driven Neural Network Optimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02297v1</link><description>Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefinedoptimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond toinstabilities or emerging training issues.

At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server tomediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate thatInteractive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivityto initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomouslymonitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize trainingdynamics.</description><author>Wentao Zhang, Yang Young Lu, Yuntian Deng</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:59:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02297v1</guid></item><item><title>Continual Personalization for Diffusion Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02296v1</link><description>Updating diffusion models in an incremental setting would be practical inreal-world applications yet computationally challenging.

To address this, we adapt Native SparseAttention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adaptsQwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. Weemploy a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving denseattention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared totoken-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achievesimproved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, andspatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1)reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attentionallocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4)the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.</description><author>Enxin Song, Wenhao Chai, Shusheng Yang, Ethan Armand, Xiaojun Shan, Haiyang Xu, Jianwen Xie, Zhuowen Tu</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:58:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02295v1</guid></item><item><title>F2LLM Technical Report: Matching SOTA Embedding Performance with 6 Million Open-Source Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02294v1</link><description>We introduce F2LLM - Foundation to Feature Large Language Models, a suite ofstate-of-the-art embedding models in three sizes: 0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B.

While diffusion models have achievedremarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuousGaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified frameworkfor jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyondunification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, andprincipled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suitedfor posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusionposterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yieldssparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbssamplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome theselimitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for maskeddiffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantizedexpectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, andanchored remasking for adaptive decoding.

Existing approaches that discoversafety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts oremploy automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attackdata, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did notexplore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to considernovel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics andstrategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recentfindings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turnattacks compared to single-turn attacks.

Beyond theircreative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators forrobotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible objectinteractions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address thislimitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided videogeneration that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, andeffects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our methodgenerates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. Wepropose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motionsupervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusionmodels (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstratesignificant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textualconditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective supportfor synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show thatKineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- andhigh-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be madepublicly available.</description><author>David Romero, Ariana Bermudez, Hao Li, Fabio Pizzati, Ivan Laptev</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:56:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02284v1</guid></item><item><title>Self-Forcing++: Towards Minute-Scale High-Quality Video Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02283v1</link><description>Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achievingunprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformerarchitectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly whenextending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressiveformulations for long video generation, typically by distilling fromshort-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher modelscannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond theirtraining horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising fromthe compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, wepropose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation inlong-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-videoteachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers onexploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for thestudent model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposureand error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previousmethods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability ofgenerating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of themaximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50xlonger than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks andour proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantiallyoutperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency.

To address these challenges, we introduceVidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes amulti-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policyoptimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments andinsightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real andAI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefullydesigning the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We thenfine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that targettemporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstratethat VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existingbenchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%.

One important assumption of KD is that the teacher's originaldataset will also be available when training the student. However, insituations such as continual learning and distilling large models trained oncompany-withheld datasets, having access to the original data may not always bepossible. This leads practitioners towards utilizing other sources ofsupplemental data, which could yield mixed results. One must then ask: "whatmakes a good dataset for transferring knowledge from teacher to student?" Manywould assume that only real in-domain imagery is viable, but is that the onlyoption? In this work, we explore multiple possible surrogate distillationdatasets and demonstrate that many different datasets, even unnatural syntheticimagery, can serve as a suitable alternative in KD.

Recent studies have identified a specific subset ofhallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictiveuncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimatingpredictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have beendeveloped. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertaintyestimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA)datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximatecorrectness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and,consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allowsone to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. Wepropose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlationexperiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithmsfor NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judgevariants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explorestructured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detectiontasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators.

The proper evaluation of trafficforecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly availablebenchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of informationabout road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information aboutroad properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that fallsshort of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly containinformation about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while cityroad networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to muchdenser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we providea more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecastingby releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, withthe largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-foldincrease relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich roadfeatures and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and trafficspeed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We showthat most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for trafficforecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome thisissue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting thatuses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thusachieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating strongerforecasting performance.

Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,sensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting theholistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up thepossibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignalmodalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability ofhealth monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeleddatasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks andmodalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers apromising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to supportmodel training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based onknowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongsidestudent model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.This challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundationmodels that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks atthe cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework forunsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training alightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enableinformation flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,we introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where thebridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as thebridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignalmodalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number oftrainable parameters by 88--99\% while maintaining or even improving transferperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>Chenqi Li, Yu Liu, Timothy Denison, Tingting Zhu</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:51:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02276v1</guid></item><item><title>Diffusion^2: Turning 3D Environments into Radio Frequency Heatmaps</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02274v1</link><description>Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is essential forunderstanding the environment, as RF signals offer valuable insights beyond thecapabilities of RGB cameras, which are limited by the visible-light spectrum,lens coverage, and occlusions. It is also useful for supporting wirelessdiagnosis, deployment, and optimization. However, accurately predicting RFsignals in complex environments remains a challenge due to interactions withobstacles such as absorption and reflection. We introduce Diffusion^2, adiffusion-based approach that uses 3D point clouds to model the propagation ofRF signals across a wide range of frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves.To effectively capture RF-related features from 3D data, we present the RF-3DEncoder, which encapsulates the complexities of 3D geometry along withsignal-specific details. These features undergo multi-scale embedding tosimulate the actual RF signal dissemination process. Our evaluation, based onsynthetic and real-world measurements, demonstrates that Diffusion^2 accuratelyestimates the behavior of RF signals in various frequency bands andenvironmental conditions, with an error margin of just 1.9 dB and 27x fasterthan existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field.

While existing work hasprimarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks ormodalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective toinvestigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectivelytransfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluatingEnglish-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing ametric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal thatcross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, targetlanguage, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find thatmodels with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely onEnglish-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimentalresults yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantialleap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a singleparallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealingthat cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number oftraining parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy betweenactual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMsfail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumptionthat LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for thedevelopment of more language-agnostic LRMs.</description><author>Wen Yang, Junhong Wu, Chong Li, Chengqing Zong, Jiajun Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:49:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02272v1</guid></item><item><title>Riemannian Variational Flow Matching for Material and Protein Design</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12981v2</link><description>We present Riemannian Gaussian Variational Flow Matching (RG-VFM), ageometric extension of Variational Flow Matching (VFM) for generative modelingon manifolds.

Oncurved manifolds this equivalence breaks down, and we hypothesize that endpointprediction provides a stronger learning signal by directly minimizing geodesicdistances. Building on this insight, we derive a variational flow matchingobjective based on Riemannian Gaussian distributions, applicable to manifoldswith closed-form geodesics. We formally analyze its relationship to RiemannianFlow Matching (RFM), exposing that the RFM objective lacks acurvature-dependent penalty - encoded via Jacobi fields - that is naturallypresent in RG-VFM.

However,existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes twofundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and manyreal-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable fromthe web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents tointerface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving thislimitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage suchtools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them withgeneral-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduceInfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source informationseeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search withdomain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalablepipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforcescross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by triviallookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experimentswith 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web informationalone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% passrate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improvingsome domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise fromincorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs stillstruggle with even basic tool handling.</description><author>Yaxin Du, Yuanshuo Zhang, Xiyuan Yang, Yifan Zhou, Cheng Wang, Gongyi Zou, Xianghe Pang, Wenhao Wang, Menglan Chen, Shuo Tang, Zhiyu Li, Siheng Chen</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:48:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02271v1</guid></item><item><title>microCLIP: Unsupervised CLIP Adaptation via Coarse-Fine Token Fusion for Fine-Grained Image Classification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02270v1</link><description>Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) forfine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic localcues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarseglobal features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approachoverlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-trainingframework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations usingfine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided$\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global$\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, weintroduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, viamulti-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tunedwith TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, whichconvexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits toiteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latentfine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracygain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.Our code is available at https://github.com/sathiiii/microCLIP.</description><author>Sathira Silva, Eman Ali, Chetan Arora, Muhammad Haris Khan</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:47:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02270v1</guid></item><item><title>Do You Know Where Your Camera Is?

Doing so requires realizing the most relevantprimitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncoverthis kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by largemodels fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting intoverbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, weintroduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions ofprocedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learningsuccessful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multipleabstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building asolution while using the information provided by these abstractions. Thisresults in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointlytrains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setupeffectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals ofabstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization toharder problems.

Existing solutionsalleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducingtoken count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporaldynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. Inthis work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information anddemonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. Tomaintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger tokenfootprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamicallybalances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token countper video.

To reducethe complexity, we develop VITA(VIsion-To-Action policy), a noise-free andconditioning-free policy learning framework that directly maps visualrepresentations to latent actions using flow matching. VITA treats latentvisual representations as the source of the flow, thus eliminating the need ofconditioning. As expected, bridging vision and action is challenging, becauseactions are lower-dimensional, less structured, and sparser than visualrepresentations; moreover, flow matching requires the source and target to havethe same dimensionality. To overcome this, we introduce an action autoencoderthat maps raw actions into a structured latent space aligned with visuallatents, trained jointly with flow matching. To further prevent latent spacecollapse, we propose flow latent decoding, which anchors the latent generationprocess by backpropagating the action reconstruction loss through the flowmatching ODE (ordinary differential equations) solving steps. We evaluate VITAon 8 simulation and 2 real-world tasks from ALOHA and Robomimic.

Prior methods often rely on single-view features or insufficientlymodel user behavior across time. In this work, we introduce Co-NAML-LSTUR, ahybrid news recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentivemulti-view news encoding and LSTUR for hierarchical user modeling, designed fortraining on limited data resources. Our approach leverages BERT-basedembeddings to enhance semantic representation. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on twowidely used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Results show that our modelsignificantly outperforms strong baselines, achieving improvements over NRMS by1.55% in AUC and 1.15% in MRR, and over NAML by 2.45% in AUC and 1.71% in MRR.These findings highlight the effectiveness of our efficiency-focused hybridmodel, which combines multi-view news modeling with dual-scale userrepresentations for practical, resource-limited resources rather than a claimto absolute state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Along with vision, it providesessential information for understanding our surroundings. Despite advances inneural implicit representations, learning acoustics that align with visualscenes remains a challenge. We propose NeRAF, a method that jointly learnsacoustic and radiance fields. NeRAF synthesizes both novel views andspatialized room impulse responses (RIR) at new positions by conditioning theacoustic field on 3D scene geometric and appearance priors from the radiancefield. The generated RIR can be applied to auralize any audio signal. Eachmodality can be rendered independently and at spatially distinct positions,offering greater versatility. We demonstrate that NeRAF generates high-qualityaudio on SoundSpaces and RAF datasets, achieving significant performanceimprovements over prior methods while being more data-efficient. Additionally,NeRAF enhances novel view synthesis of complex scenes trained with sparse datathrough cross-modal learning. NeRAF is designed as a Nerfstudio module,providing convenient access to realistic audio-visual generation.</description><author>Amandine Brunetto, Sascha Hornauer, Fabien Moutarde</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:41:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18213v4</guid></item><item><title>Can Code-Switched Texts Activate a Knowledge Switch in LLMs? A Case Study on English-Korean Code-Switching</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18436v4</link><description>Recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate multilingual abilities, yetthey are English-centric due to dominance of English in training corpora. Thelimited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge.Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate betweenlanguages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuancesthat can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specificknowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whethercode-switching can activate, or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoningwhen LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, wefirst present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset.We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs bysubdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledgeleveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS canfaithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specificdomains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource languagetasks.</description><author>Seoyeon Kim, Huiseo Kim, Chanjun Park, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:40:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18436v4</guid></item><item><title>DragFlow: Unleashing DiT Priors with Region Based Supervision for Drag Editing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02253v1</link><description>Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the targetregion, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural imagemanifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flowmatching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantlystronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-basedediting has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes thefirst framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-basedediting, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We firstshow that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficientlystructured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. Toovercome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent featuresupervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalizationadapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preservingbackground fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodallarge language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments onDragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based andregion-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based imageediting.

It enablesboth wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantiallyimproving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling methodestablishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperformingprior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, withcomprehensive ablations validating key design choices.

However, theyoften suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthyreasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency ofthe models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to thecomplexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric TokenEntropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of explorationthroughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative EntropyRegulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the modeldynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process andprovide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimentalresults across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approachsubstantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solvingability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases byup to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method increating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.</description><author>Tianyi Jiang, Yi Bin, Yujuan Ding, Kainian Zhu, Fei Ma, Jingkuan Song, Heng Tao Shen</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:36:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02249v1</guid></item><item><title>Probabilistic Reasoning with LLMs for k-anonymity Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09674v4</link><description>Probabilistic reasoning is a key aspect of both human and artificialintelligence that allows for handling uncertainty and ambiguity indecision-making.

Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficientbut lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-spaceapproaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incurcubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novelcryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) thatoperates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead ofmodeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3DGaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve thetraining efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussiansthat contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memoryfootprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-artmethods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These resultsestablish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction,unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy.

While this process encourages having full,individual words as tokens, it introduces a fundamental limitation in mosttokenization algorithms such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE). Specifically,pre-tokenization causes the distribution of tokens in a corpus to heavily skewtowards common, full-length words. This skewed distribution limits the benefitsof expanding to larger vocabularies, since the additional tokens appear withprogressively lower counts. To overcome this barrier, we propose BoundlessBPE,a modified BPE algorithm that relaxes the pretoken boundary constraint. Ourapproach selectively merges two complete pretokens into a larger unit we term asuperword. Superwords are not necessarily semantically cohesive. For example,the pretokens " of" and " the" might be combined to form the superword " ofthe". This merging strategy results in a substantially more uniformdistribution of tokens across a corpus than standard BPE, and compresses textmore effectively, with up to a 15% increase in bytes per token.</description><author>Craig W.

However, standardon-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leadingto computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL hashighlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experiencecharacteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remainsunderexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes areasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy aseffective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we proposeExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework thatorganizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policyobjective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments onfive backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistentlyimproves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with anaverage gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPOstabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methodsfail. These results highlight principled experience management as a keyingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.</description><author>Runzhe Zhan, Yafu Li, Zhi Wang, Xiaoye Qu, Dongrui Liu, Jing Shao, Derek F.

The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gapby showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning instructured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clearpractical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. Toaddress this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset thatintroduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understandingskills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed toimprove both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-awarereward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparserewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RLscheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoningtasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventionalSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plusdemonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistentperformance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover,models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, andgeneral tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understandingand reasoning capabilities.</description><author>Sicheng Feng, Kaiwen Tuo, Song Wang, Lingdong Kong, Jianke Zhu, Huan Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:29:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02240v1</guid></item><item><title>FalconWing: An Ultra-Light Indoor Fixed-Wing UAV Platform for Vision-Based Autonomy</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01383v2</link><description>We introduce FalconWing, an ultra-light (150 g) indoor fixed-wing UAVplatform for vision-based autonomy.

In this work, we challenge this assumption, showingthat full-network updates can be fundamentally suboptimal, both in theory andin practice. We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Trainingmethod-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset oflayers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency ofprogressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tierperformance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wisesmoothness and layer-wise $(L^0, L^1)$-smoothness, covering deterministic andstochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressivetraining in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis furtherreveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specificrelationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNNexperiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperformsfull-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to $1.4\times$ faster inwall-clock time.

While several SAE variants have beenproposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from theoriginal dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such aframework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We showthat a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, includingReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitationof existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes intoseparate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. Toaddress this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over thelargest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negativeactivations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasksshow that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopKmatches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approachthat requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work tooutperform SAEs.</description><author>Xudong Zhu, Mohammad Mahdi Khalili, Zhihui Zhu</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:28:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00404v2</guid></item><item><title>Forecasting Generative Amplification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08048v2</link><description>Generative networks are perfect tools to enhance the speed and precision ofLHC simulations.

We systematically evaluate theeffectiveness of Influence Functions (IFs) as a selection tool for thesesettings, highlighting the potential of IFs to better capture theinformativeness of examples within the demonstration pool. For the Mixture ofTasks setting, demonstrations are drawn from 28 diverse tasks, including MMLU,BigBench, StrategyQA, and CommonsenseQA. We demonstrate that combiningBertScore-Recall (BSR) with an IF surrogate model can further improveperformance, leading to average absolute accuracy gains of 0.37\% and 1.45\%for 3-shot and 5-shot setups when compared to traditional ICL metrics. In theNoisy ICL setting, we examine scenarios where demonstrations might bemislabeled or have adversarial noise. Our experiments show that reweightingtraditional ICL selectors (BSR and Cosine Similarity) with IF-based selectorsboosts accuracy by an average of 2.90\% for Cosine Similarity and 2.94\% forBSR on noisy GLUE benchmarks. For the adversarial sub-setting, we show theutility of using IFs for task-agnostic demonstration selection for backdoorattack mitigation. Showing a 32.89\% reduction in Attack Success Rate comparedto task-aware methods. In sum, we propose a robust framework for demonstrationselection that generalizes beyond traditional ICL, offering valuable insightsinto the role of IFs for Indirect ICL.</description><author>Hadi Askari, Shivanshu Gupta, Terry Tong, Fei Wang, Anshuman Chhabra, Muhao Chen</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:19:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01473v3</guid></item><item><title>The Reasoning Boundary Paradox: How Reinforcement Learning Constrains Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02230v1</link><description>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a keymethod for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recentevidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary ratherthan expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR byanalyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explainthis failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning tosolve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correctsolutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or theprobability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, weuncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforcesproblems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, whilesuppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoreticaland empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we showthat this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RLobjectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curationalgorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achievingnotable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance.

While Transformers have been the dominantarchitecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity withrespect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameterregime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior ofTransformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guidefuture model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior forxLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP andparametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number oftraining tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal modelsizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previouswork. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findingsreveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scalesfavorably compared to Transformers.

However,prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policyteacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which mayintroduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limitingreasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacherstrategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-GuidancePolicy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leveragesguidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policymodel fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approachexpands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting thestudent to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensiveexperiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), witha 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% onout-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance andenabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, ourmethod achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, morepowerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstratea more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.Our code is available at https://github.com/SII-Enigma/AMPO.</description><author>Xiaoyang Yuan, Yujuan Ding, Yi Bin, Wenqi Shao, Jinyu Cai, Jingkuan Song, Yang Yang, Hengtao Shen</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:14:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02227v1</guid></item><item><title>TempoControl: Temporal Attention Guidance for Text-to-Video Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02226v1</link><description>Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation ofhigh-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these modelsfrequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow usersto specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generatedsequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows fortemporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiringretraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attentionmaps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing ofconcepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attentionusing three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with acontrol signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (viaenergy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allowsprecise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. Wedemonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications,including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well asaction and audio-aligned generation.</description><author>Shira Schiber, Ofir Lindenbaum, Idan Schwartz</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:13:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02226v1</guid></item><item><title>Segmentor-Guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning for Locally Coherent and Targeted Image Synthesis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24913v2</link><description>Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting trainingdata, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely onexternal classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness ofsubject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). Forstructure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in achest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result inundesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work usedpixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypotheticalsegmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain.

Recently, time series foundationmodels have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the qualityand efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predictindependent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full jointpredictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realisticcorrelation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, whichcan be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approachto efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existingmulti-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-basedapproach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster thanautoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality bymitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.</description><author>Ethan Baron, Boris Oreshkin, Ruijun Ma, Hanyu Zhang, Kari Torkkola, Michael W.

Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists,given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast tothe classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisherinformation matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalizationof the relative entropy or the R\'enyi relative entropy. In this paper, Iderive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, andgeometric R\'enyi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing sobeing the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives.Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$,the log-Euclidean R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori informationmatrix, and the geometric R\'enyi relative entropy leads to theright-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resultinginformation matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negativevalues of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities donot. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi relativeentropies. For parameterized thermal states, I establish formulas for their$\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms forestimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.</description><author>Mark M.

Recently,diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkablesuccess compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches.Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how welldiffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependenciesbetween the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our workaddresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditionaldiffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty inmissing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity boundsbased on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions usingtransformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missingvalues. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputationare significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validatethese theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-maskingtraining strategy to enhance the imputation performance.</description><author>Zeqi Ye, Minshuo Chen</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:00:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02216v1</guid></item><item><title>C2AL: Cohort-Contrastive Auxiliary Learning for Large-scale Recommendation Systems</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02215v1</link><description>Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objectiveimplicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-worlddata are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditionaldistributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data isused for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns,neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learningability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In thispaper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role infactorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to addressthis challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing thosewith strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previousresearch, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads tomitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels toregularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learningprocess of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minoritycohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massiveproduction datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models.Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-graineduser-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16%reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% ontargeted minority cohorts.</description><author>Mertcan Cokbas, Ziteng Liu, Zeyi Tao, Chengkai Zhang, Elder Veliz, Qin Huang, Ellie Wen, Huayu Li, Qiang Jin, Murat Duman, Benjamin Au, Guy Lebanon, Sagar Chordia</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:00:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02215v1</guid></item><item><title>Multiple Queries with Multiple Keys: A Precise Prompt Matching Paradigm for Prompt-based Continual Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12635v3</link><description>Continual learning requires machine learning models to continuously acquirenew knowledge in dynamic environments while avoiding the forgetting of previousknowledge. Prompt-based continual learning methods effectively address theissue of catastrophic forgetting through prompt expansion and selection.However, existing approaches often suffer from low accuracy in promptselection, which can result in the model receiving biased knowledge and makingbiased predictions. To address this issue, we propose the Multiple Queries withMultiple Keys (MQMK) prompt matching paradigm for precise prompt selection. Thegoal of MQMK is to select the prompts whose training data distribution mostclosely matches that of the test sample. Specifically, Multiple Queries enableprecise breadth search by introducing task-specific knowledge, while MultipleKeys perform deep search by representing the feature distribution of trainingsamples at a fine-grained level. Each query is designed to perform localmatching with a designated task to reduce interference across queries.Experiments show that MQMK enhances the prompt matching rate by over 30\% inchallenging scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widelyadopted continual learning benchmarks.

While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domainssuch as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domainremains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value andhigh-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily teststatic knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturingthe dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduceStockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents inrealistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily marketsignals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequentialbuy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metricssuch as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Ourevaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) andopen-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLMagents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several modelsdemonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk moreeffectively.

Whileinitially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models havedemonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such modelsrequire mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typicallyusing recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scalesquadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very longsequences. We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replacesself-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations toreduce sequence length. Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks,which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, anup-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks. We conduct extensiveexperiments to support our architectural choices. Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improvesperceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. Our experiments alsosuggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallowlayers take care of short-term features. Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths,Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba.Future directions include applications to text and vision, as well asmulti-modal scenarios, where a Poolformer-based LLM could effectively processdense representations of images and videos.</description><author>Daniel Gallo Fernández</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 16:52:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02206v1</guid></item><item><title>Say One Thing, Do Another? Diagnosing Reasoning-Execution Gaps in VLM-Powered Mobile-Use Agents</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02204v1</link><description>Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown greatpotential in interpreting natural language instructions and generatingcorresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studiessuggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improvethe execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize executionaccuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truthactions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs mayunknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial lossor trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework todiagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches theground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct actionbut execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds butreasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental resultsacross a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-executiongaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently thanreasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysisshows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns instate-of-the-art models.

Large language models (LLMs) can lower thatbarrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In thispaper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agentthat translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a singleshot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe theoverall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and alsoconduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into futureareas for targeted improvements.

The problem is challenging in decentralized settings with robots thathave limited communication and sensing capabilities. We propose a learnablePerception-Action-Communication (LPAC) architecture for the problem, wherein aconvolutional neural network (CNN) processes localized perception; a graphneural network (GNN) facilitates robot communications; finally, a shallowmulti-layer perceptron (MLP) computes robot actions. The GNN enablescollaboration in the robot swarm by computing what information to communicatewith nearby robots and how to incorporate received information. Evaluationsshow that the LPAC models -- trained using imitation learning -- outperformstandard decentralized and centralized coverage control algorithms. The learnedpolicy generalizes to environments different from the training dataset,transfers to larger environments with more robots, and is robust to noisyposition estimates. The results indicate the suitability of LPAC architecturesfor decentralized navigation in robot swarms to achieve collaborative behavior.</description><author>Saurav Agarwal, Ramya Muthukrishnan, Walker Gosrich, Vijay Kumar, Alejandro Ribeiro</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 16:48:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04855v4</guid></item><item><title>Cross-Breed Pig Identification Using Auricular Vein Pattern Recognition: A Machine Learning Approach for Small-Scale Farming Applications</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02197v1</link><description>Accurate livestock identification is a cornerstone of modern farming: itsupports health monitoring, breeding programs, and productivity tracking.However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips,are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical forsmall-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometricidentification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular veinpatterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breedpigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using astandard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer visionpipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural andspatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were thenclassified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precisionacross mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing toclassification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstratingfeasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragilephysical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system providesfarmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification.More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular veinbiometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential toextend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agriculturalcommunities.</description><author>Emmanuel Nsengiyumvaa, Leonard Niyitegekaa, Eric Umuhoza</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 16:45:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02197v1</guid></item><item><title>GenExam: A Multidisciplinary Text-to-Image Exam</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14232v2</link><description>Exams are a fundamental test of expert-level intelligence and requireintegrated understanding, reasoning, and generation.

We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centricframework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programminglanguages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disruptstructural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from fivemodel families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performanceon natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, ourresults show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations thansemantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractionslike pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding thesame information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax canoften retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code withmisleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist.Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoringnatural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rustfavoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight intohow different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design oftraining data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.</description><author>Abdul Waheed, Zhen Wu, Carolyn Rosé, Daphne Ippolito</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 16:45:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21499v2</guid></item><item><title>UpSafe$^\circ$C: Upcycling for Controllable Safety in Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02194v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a widerange of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful contentgeneration and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- includingexternal guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment --each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. Inthis work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLMsafety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifiessafety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activatesoriginal MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFTstrategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving generalcapabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce asafety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-offbetween safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model,and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safetyimprovements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintainingcompetitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safetytemperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves thePareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a newdirection for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular,and inference-aware control.</description><author>Yuhao Sun, Zhuoer Xu, Shiwen Cui, Kun Yang, Lingyun Yu, Yongdong Zhang, Hongtao Xie</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 16:43:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02194v1</guid></item><item><title>Convergence analysis of online algorithms for vector-valued kernel regression</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07779v5</link><description>We consider the problem of approximating the regression function $f_\mu:\,\Omega \to Y$ from noisy $\mu$-distributed vector-valued data$(\omega_m,y_m)\in\Omega\times Y$ by an online learning algorithm using areproducing kernel Hilbert space $H$ (RKHS) as prior. In an online algorithm,i.i.d. samples become available one by one via a random process and aresuccessively processed to build approximations to the regression function.Assuming that the regression function essentially belongs to $H$ (soft learningscenario), we provide estimates for the expected squared error in the RKHS normof the approximations $f^{(m)}\in H$ obtained by a standard regularized onlineapproximation algorithm. In particular, we show an order-optimal estimate $$\mathbb{E}(\|\epsilon^{(m)}\|_H^2)\le C (m+1)^{-s/(2+s)},\qquad m=1,2,\ldots,$$ where $\epsilon^{(m)}$ denotes the error term after $m$ processed data, theparameter $0&lt;s\leq 1$ expresses an additional smoothness assumption on theregression function, and the constant $C$ depends on the variance of the inputnoise, the smoothness of the regression function, and other parameters of thealgorithm.

As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, whichmarkedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existingbenchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, andscoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluationframework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses.

Ourstacked ensemble model (Random Forest + Histogram Gradient Boosting + ElasticNet) achieves R2=0.980 (RMSE=5.01 pp) with rigorous spatiotemporalcross-validation preventing data leakage. To address machine learninglimitations in extrapolative climate scenarios, we develop a hybrid approachcombining learned climate-permafrost relationships (60%) with physicalpermafrost sensitivity models (40%, -10 pp/C). Under RCP8.5 forcing (+5C over10 years), we project mean permafrost fraction decline of -20.3 pp (median:-20.0 pp), with 51.5% of Arctic Russia experiencing over 20 percentage pointloss. Infrastructure risk classification identifies 15% high-risk zones (25%medium-risk) with spatially explicit uncertainty maps.

Directly projecting 2Dfeatures into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcinggeometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scaleannotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominantsegmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregatedfeatures. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a smallStudent Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features usinggeometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. Duringinference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise thepoint cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting fromlatent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurifyeffectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency.Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurifyachieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about1.5% of the training data.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this byintroducing lightweight, trainable modules while keeping most pre-trainedweights fixed. The prevailing approach, LoRA, models updates using a low-rankdecomposition, but its expressivity is inherently constrained by the rank.Recent methods like HiRA aim to increase expressivity by incorporating aHadamard product with the frozen weights, but still rely on the structure ofthe pre-trained model. We introduce ABBA, a new PEFT architecture thatreparameterizes the update as a Hadamard product of two independently learnablelow-rank matrices. In contrast to prior work, ABBA fully decouples the updatefrom the pre-trained weights, enabling both components to be optimized freely.This leads to significantly higher expressivity under the same parameterbudget, a property we validate through matrix reconstruction experiments.Empirically, ABBA achieves state-of-the-art results on arithmetic andcommonsense reasoning benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing PEFTmethods by a significant margin across multiple models.

Prior works have investigated representational alignment betweenartificial neural networks and the visual cortex. Nevertheless, these findingsare indirect and offer limited insights to the structure of neural populationsthemselves. Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic featuresfrom neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations.This leaves open a scientific question: "how feature-specific visualinformation is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas,and whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningfulsubspaces." To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leveragesthe generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate thevisual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method firstuses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latentsubspace from neural populations. Subsequently, we propose a mutual information(MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specificvisual-semantic features encoded by each latent group. We validate MIG-Vis onmulti-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex oftwo macaques. The synthesized results demonstrate that our method identifiesneural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visualfeatures, including object pose, inter-category transformations, andintra-class content.

This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient LangevinDynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima inhigh-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD usesthe stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussiannoise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), therebyoptimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvatureinformation. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measureof fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the globalminimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever theinverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properlycoupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for thebenefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establishnon-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the bestknown rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularizedobjective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks,in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLDachieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baselinealgorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that ofSAM.
