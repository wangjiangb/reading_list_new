We hypothesize that these failures arise because standard denoising objectives lack explicit incentives for geometric coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoGPA (Video Geometric Preference Alignment), a data-efficient self-supervised framework that leverages a geometry foundation model to automatically derive dense preference signals that guide VDMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This approach effectively steers the generative distribution toward inherent 3D consistency without requiring human annotations. VideoGPA significantly enhances temporal stability, physical plausibility, and motion coherence using minimal preference pairs, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in extensive experiments.</description><author>Hongyang Du, Junjie Ye, Xiaoyan Cong, Runhao Li, Jingcheng Ni, Aman Agarwal, Zeqi Zhou, Zekun Li, Randall Balestriero, Yue Wang</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:59:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23286v1</guid></item><item><title>End-to-end Optimization of Belief and Policy Learning in Shared Autonomy Paradigms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23285v1</link><description>Shared autonomy systems require principled methods for inferring user intent and determining appropriate assistance levels. This is a central challenge in human-robot interaction, where systems must be successful while being mindful of user agency. Previous approaches relied on static blending ratios or separated goal inference from assistance arbitration, leading to suboptimal performance in unstructured environments. We introduce BRACE (Bayesian Reinforcement Assistance with Context Encoding), a novel framework that fine-tunes Bayesian intent inference and context-adaptive assistance through an architecture enabling end-to-end gradient flow between intent inference and assistance arbitration. Our pipeline conditions collaborative control policies on environmental context and complete goal probability distributions. We provide analysis showing (1) optimal assistance levels should decrease with goal uncertainty and increase with environmental constraint severity, and (2) integrating belief information into policy learning yields a quadratic expected regret advantage over sequential approaches. We validated our algorithm against SOTA methods (IDA, DQN) using a three-part evaluation progressively isolating distinct challenges of end-effector control: (1) core human-interaction dynamics in a 2D human-in-the-loop cursor task, (2) non-linear dynamics of a robotic arm, and (3) integrated manipulation under goal ambiguity and environmental constraints. We demonstrate improvements over SOTA, achieving 6.3% higher success rates and 41% increased path efficiency, and 36.3% success rate and 87% path efficiency improvement over unassisted control. Our results confirmed that integrated optimization is most beneficial in complex, goal-ambiguous scenarios, and is generalizable across robotic domains requiring goal-directed assistance, advancing the SOTA for adaptive shared autonomy.</description><author>MH Farhadi, Ali Rabiee, Sima Ghafoori, Anna Cetera, Andrew Fisher, Reza Abiri</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:59:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23285v1</guid></item><item><title>Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Projective Quasimetric Planning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18847v3</link><description>Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning seeks to train agents to reach specified goals from previously collected trajectories. Scaling that promises to long-horizon tasks remains challenging, notably due to compounding value-estimation errors. Principled geometric offers a potential solution to address these issues. Following this insight, we introduce Projective Quasimetric Planning (ProQ), a compositional framework that learns an asymmetric distance and then repurposes it, firstly as a repulsive energy forcing a sparse set of keypoints to uniformly spread over the learned latent space, and secondly as a structured directional cost guiding towards proximal sub-goals. In particular, ProQ couples this geometry with a Lagrangian out-of-distribution detector to ensure the learned keypoints stay within reachable areas. By unifying metric learning, keypoint coverage, and goal-conditioned control, our approach produces meaningful sub-goals and robustly drives long-horizon goal-reaching on diverse a navigation benchmarks.</description><author>Anthony Kobanda, Waris Radji, Mathieu Petitbois, Odalric-Ambrym Maillard, Rémy Portelas</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:57:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18847v3</guid></item><item><title>From Cold Start to Active Learning: Embedding-Based Scan Selection for Medical Image Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18532v2</link><description>Accurate segmentation annotations are critical for disease monitoring, yet manual labeling remains a major bottleneck due to the time and expertise required. Active learning (AL) alleviates this burden by prioritizing informative samples for annotation, typically through a diversity-based cold-start phase followed by uncertainty-driven selection. We propose a novel cold-start sampling strategy that combines foundation-model embeddings with clustering, including automatic selection of the number of clusters and proportional sampling across clusters, to construct a diverse and representative initial training. This is followed by an uncertainty-based AL framework that integrates spatial diversity to guide sample selection. The proposed method is intuitive and interpretable, enabling visualization of the feature-space distribution of candidate samples. We evaluate our approach on three datasets spanning X-ray and MRI modalities. On the CheXmask dataset, the cold-start strategy outperforms random selection, improving Dice from 0.918 to 0.929 and reducing the Hausdorff distance from 32.41 to 27.66 mm. In the AL setting, combined entropy and diversity selection improves Dice from 0.919 to 0.939 and reduces the Hausdorff distance from 30.10 to 19.16 mm. On the Montgomery dataset, cold-start gains are substantial, with Dice improving from 0.928 to 0.950 and Hausdorff distance decreasing from 14.22 to 9.38 mm. On the SynthStrip dataset, cold-start selection slightly affects Dice but reduces the Hausdorff distance from 9.43 to 8.69 mm, while active learning improves Dice from 0.816 to 0.826 and reduces the Hausdorff distance from 7.76 to 6.38 mm. Overall, the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods in low-data regimes, improving segmentation accuracy.</description><author>Devon Levy, Bar Assayag, Laura Gaspar, Ilan Shimshoni, Bella Specktor-Fadida</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:56:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18532v2</guid></item><item><title>User Prompting Strategies and Prompt Enhancement Methods for Open-Set Object Detection in XR Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23281v1</link><description>Open-set object detection (OSOD) localizes objects while identifying and rejecting unknown classes at inference. While recent OSOD models perform well on benchmarks, their behavior under realistic user prompting remains underexplored. In interactive XR settings, user-generated prompts are often ambiguous, underspecified, or overly detailed. To study prompt-conditioned robustness, we evaluate two OSOD models, GroundingDINO and YOLO-E, on real-world XR images and simulate diverse user prompting behaviors using vision-language models. We consider four prompt types: standard, underdetailed, overdetailed, and pragmatically ambiguous, and examine the impact of two enhancement strategies on these prompts. Results show that both models exhibit stable performance under underdetailed and standard prompts, while they suffer degradation under ambiguous prompts. Overdetailed prompts primarily affect GroundingDINO. Prompt enhancement substantially improves robustness under ambiguity, yielding gains exceeding 55% mIoU and 41% average confidence. Based on the findings, we propose several prompting strategies and prompt enhancement methods for OSOD models in XR environments.</description><author>Junfeng Lin, Yanming Xiu, Maria Gorlatova</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:55:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23281v1</guid></item><item><title>Decoupled Diffusion Sampling for Inverse Problems on Function Spaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23280v1</link><description>We propose a data-efficient, physics-aware generative framework in function space for inverse PDE problems. Existing plug-and-play diffusion posterior samplers represent physics implicitly through joint coefficient-solution modeling, requiring substantial paired supervision. In contrast, our Decoupled Diffusion Inverse Solver (DDIS) employs a decoupled design: an unconditional diffusion learns the coefficient prior, while a neural operator explicitly models the forward PDE for guidance. This decoupling enables superior data efficiency and effective physics-informed learning, while naturally supporting Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) to avoid over-smoothing in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). Theoretically, we prove that DDIS avoids the guidance attenuation failure of joint models when training data is scarce. Empirically, DDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance under sparse observation, improving $l_2$ error by 11% and spectral error by 54% on average; when data is limited to 1%, DDIS maintains accuracy with 40% advantage in $l_2$ error compared to joint models.</description><author>Thomas Y.

This process called Continual Reinforcement Learning poses non-trivial difficulties, from preventing catastrophic forgetting to ensuring the scalability of the approaches considered. Building on recent advances, we introduce a benchmark providing a suite of video-game navigation scenarios, thus filling a gap in the literature and capturing key challenges : catastrophic forgetting, task adaptation, and memory efficiency. We define a set of various tasks and datasets, evaluation protocols, and metrics to assess the performance of algorithms, including state-of-the-art baselines. Our benchmark is designed not only to foster reproducible research and to accelerate progress in continual reinforcement learning for gaming, but also to provide a reproducible framework for production pipelines -- helping practitioners to identify and to apply effective approaches.</description><author>Anthony Kobanda, Odalric-Ambrym Maillard, Rémy Portelas</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:53:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02883v2</guid></item><item><title>FOCUS: DLLMs Know How to Tame Their Compute Bound</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23278v1</link><description>Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) offer a compelling alternative to Auto-Regressive models, but their deployment is constrained by high decoding cost. In this work, we identify a key inefficiency in DLLM decoding: while computation is parallelized over token blocks, only a small subset of tokens is decodable at each diffusion step, causing most compute to be wasted on non-decodable tokens. We further observe a strong correlation between attention-derived token importance and token-wise decoding probability. Based on this insight, we propose FOCUS -- an inference system designed for DLLMs. By dynamically focusing computation on decodable tokens and evicting non-decodable ones on-the-fly, FOCUS increases the effective batch size, alleviating compute limitations and enabling scalable throughput. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FOCUS achieves up to 3.52$\times$ throughput improvement over the production-grade engine LMDeploy, while preserving or improving generation quality across multiple benchmarks. The FOCUS system is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/sands-lab/FOCUS.</description><author>Kaihua Liang, Xin Tan, An Zhong, Hong Xu, Marco Canini</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:52:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23278v1</guid></item><item><title>CAOS: Conformal Aggregation of One-Shot Predictors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05219v2</link><description>One-shot prediction enables rapid adaptation of pretrained foundation models to new tasks using only one labeled example, but lacks principled uncertainty quantification. While conformal prediction provides finite-sample coverage guarantees, standard split conformal methods are inefficient in the one-shot setting due to data splitting and reliance on a single predictor. We propose Conformal Aggregation of One-Shot Predictors (CAOS), a conformal framework that adaptively aggregates multiple one-shot predictors and uses a leave-one-out calibration scheme to fully exploit scarce labeled data. Despite violating classical exchangeability assumptions, we prove that CAOS achieves valid marginal coverage using a monotonicity-based argument. Experiments on one-shot facial landmarking and RAFT text classification tasks show that CAOS produces substantially smaller prediction sets than split conformal baselines while maintaining reliable coverage.</description><author>Maja Waldron</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:49:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05219v2</guid></item><item><title>Multi-agent Coordination via Flow Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05005v2</link><description>This work presents MAC-Flow, a simple yet expressive framework for multi-agent coordination. We argue that requirements of effective coordination are twofold: (i) a rich representation of the diverse joint behaviors present in offline data and (ii) the ability to act efficiently in real time. However, prior approaches often sacrifice one for the other, i.e., denoising diffusion-based solutions capture complex coordination but are computationally slow, while Gaussian policy-based solutions are fast but brittle in handling multi-agent interaction. MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a flow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into decentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast execution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and $34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and computational cost, specifically achieving about $\boldsymbol{\times14.5}$ faster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining good performance. At the same time, its inference speed is similar to that of prior Gaussian policy-based offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods.</description><author>Dongsu Lee, Daehee Lee, Amy Zhang</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:48:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05005v2</guid></item><item><title>Denoising the Deep Sky: Physics-Based CCD Noise Formation for Astronomical Imaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23276v1</link><description>Astronomical imaging remains noise-limited under practical observing constraints, while standard calibration pipelines mainly remove structured artifacts and leave stochastic noise largely unresolved. Learning-based denoising is promising, yet progress is hindered by scarce paired training data and the need for physically interpretable and reproducible models in scientific workflows. We propose a physics-based noise synthesis framework tailored to CCD noise formation. The pipeline models photon shot noise, photo-response non-uniformity, dark-current noise, readout effects, and localized outliers arising from cosmic-ray hits and hot pixels. To obtain low-noise inputs for synthesis, we average multiple unregistered exposures to produce high-SNR bases. Realistic noisy counterparts synthesized from these bases using our noise model enable the construction of abundant paired datasets for supervised learning. We further introduce a real-world dataset across multi-bands acquired with two twin ground-based telescopes, providing paired raw frames and instrument-pipeline calibrated frames, together with calibration data and stacked high-SNR bases for real-world evaluation.</description><author>Shuhong Liu, Xining Ge, Ziying Gu, Lin Gu, Ziteng Cui, Xuangeng Chu, Jun Liu, Dong Li, Tatsuya Harada</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:47:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23276v1</guid></item><item><title>Expert Evaluation and the Limits of Human Feedback in Mental Health AI Safety Testing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18061v2</link><description>Learning from human feedback~(LHF) assumes that expert judgments, appropriately aggregated, yield valid ground truth for training and evaluating AI systems. We tested this assumption in mental health, where high safety stakes make expert consensus essential. Three certified psychiatrists independently evaluated LLM-generated responses using a calibrated rubric. Despite similar training and shared instructions, inter-rater reliability was consistently poor ($ICC$ $0.087$--$0.295$), falling below thresholds considered acceptable for consequential assessment. Disagreement was highest on the most safety-critical items. Suicide and self-harm responses produced greater divergence than any other category, and was systematic rather than random. One factor yielded negative reliability (Krippendorff's $α= -0.203$), indicating structured disagreement worse than chance. Qualitative interviews revealed that disagreement reflects coherent but incompatible individual clinical frameworks, safety-first, engagement-centered, and culturally-informed orientations, rather than measurement error. By demonstrating that experts rely on holistic risk heuristics rather than granular factor discrimination, these findings suggest that aggregated labels function as arithmetic compromises that effectively erase grounded professional philosophies. Our results characterize expert disagreement in safety-critical AI as a sociotechnical phenomenon where professional experience introduces sophisticated layers of principled divergence. We discuss implications for reward modeling, safety classification, and evaluation benchmarks, recommending that practitioners shift from consensus-based aggregation to alignment methods that preserve and learn from expert disagreement.</description><author>Kiana Jafari, Paul Ulrich Nikolaus Rust, Duncan Eddy, Robbie Fraser, Nina Vasan, Darja Djordjevic, Akanksha Dadlani, Max Lamparth, Eugenia Kim, Mykel Kochenderfer</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:45:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18061v2</guid></item><item><title>Trajectory2Task: Training Robust Tool-Calling Agents with Synthesized Yet Verifiable Data for Complex User Intents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20144v2</link><description>Tool-calling agents are increasingly deployed in real-world customer-facing workflows. Yet most studies on tool-calling agents focus on idealized settings with general, fixed, and well-specified tasks. In real-world applications, user requests are often (1) ambiguous, (2) changing over time, or (3) infeasible due to policy constraints, and training and evaluation data that cover these diverse, complex interaction patterns remain under-represented. To bridge the gap, we present Trajectory2Task, a verifiable data generation pipeline for studying tool use at scale under three realistic user scenarios: ambiguous intent, changing intent, and infeasible intents. The pipeline first conducts multi-turn exploration to produce valid tool-call trajectories. It then converts these trajectories into user-facing tasks with controlled intent adaptations. This process yields verifiable task that support closed-loop evaluation and training. We benchmark seven state-of-the-art LLMs on the generated complex user scenario tasks and observe frequent failures. Finally, using successful trajectories obtained from task rollouts, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs and find consistent improvements across all three conditions, along with better generalization to unseen tool-use domains, indicating stronger general tool-calling ability.</description><author>Ziyi Wang, Yuxuan Lu, Yimeng Zhang, Ziwei Dong, Jing Huang, Jiri Gesi, Xianfeng Tang, Chen Luo, Yisi Sang, Hanqing Lu, Manling Li, Dakuo Wang</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:44:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20144v2</guid></item><item><title>Reinforcement Learning for Ballbot Navigation in Uneven Terrain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18417v2</link><description>Ballbot (i.e. Ball balancing robot) navigation usually relies on methods rooted in control theory (CT), and works that apply Reinforcement learning (RL) to the problem remain rare while generally being limited to specific subtasks (e.g. balance recovery). Unlike CT based methods, RL does not require (simplifying) assumptions about environment dynamics (e.g. the absence of slippage between the ball and the floor). In addition to this increased accuracy in modeling, RL agents can easily be conditioned on additional observations such as depth-maps without the need for explicit formulations from first principles, leading to increased adaptivity. Despite those advantages, there has been little to no investigation into the capabilities, data-efficiency and limitations of RL based methods for ballbot control and navigation. Furthermore, there is a notable absence of an open-source, RL-friendly simulator for this task. In this paper, we present an open-source ballbot simulation based on MuJoCo, and show that with appropriate conditioning on exteroceptive observations as well as reward shaping, policies learned by classical model-free RL methods are capable of effectively navigating through randomly generated uneven terrain, using a reasonable amount of data (four to five hours on a system operating at 500hz).

We explore several methods for combining the outputs of these functions, including sum, element-wise product, the addition of sum and element-wise product, representations of quadratic and cubic functions, concatenation, linear transformation of the concatenated output, and others. In our experiments, we compare FC-KAN with a multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) and other existing KANs, such as BSRBF-KAN, EfficientKAN, FastKAN, and FasterKAN, on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Two variants of FC-KAN, which use a combination of outputs from B-splines and Difference of Gaussians (DoG) and from B-splines and linear transformations in the form of a quadratic function, outperformed overall other models on the average of 5 independent training runs. We expect that FC-KAN can leverage function combinations to design future KANs.

While this formulation enables the use of advanced planning algorithms, these methods typically assume access to supervised reward signals, which are often unavailable in practical scenarios. In this work, we propose UPA, an Unsupervised Prompt Agent that realizes structured search and selection without relying on supervised feedback. Specifically, during search, UPA iteratively constructs an evolving tree structure to navigate the prompt space, guided by fine-grained and order-invariant pairwise comparisons from Large Language Models (LLMs). Crucially, as these local comparisons do not inherently yield a consistent global scale, we decouple systematic prompt exploration from final selection, introducing a two-stage framework grounded in the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model. This framework first performs path-wise Bayesian aggregation of local comparisons to filter candidates under uncertainty, followed by global tournament-style comparisons to infer latent prompt quality and identify the optimal prompt. Experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that UPA consistently outperforms existing prompt optimization methods, showing that agent-style optimization remains highly effective even in fully unsupervised settings.</description><author>Siran Peng, Weisong Zhao, Tianyu Fu, Chenxu Zhao, Tianshuo Zhang, Haoyuan Zhang, Xiangyu Zhu, Minghui Wu, Zhen Lei</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:39:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23273v1</guid></item><item><title>On the Separability of Information in Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23937v4</link><description>Diffusion models transform noise into data by injecting information that was captured in their neural network during the training phase. In this paper, we ask: \textit{what} is this information? We find that, in pixel-space diffusion models, (1) a large fraction of the total information in the neural network is committed to reconstructing small-scale perceptual details of the image, and (2) the correlations between images and their class labels are informed by the semantic content of the images, and are largely agnostic to the low-level details. We argue that these properties are intrinsically tied to the manifold structure of the data itself. Finally, we show that these facts explain the efficacy of classifier-free guidance: the guidance vector amplifies the mutual information between images and conditioning signals early in the generative process, influencing semantic structure, but tapers out as perceptual details are filled in.</description><author>Akhil Premkumar</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:38:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23937v4</guid></item><item><title>IRL-DAL: Safe and Adaptive Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving via Energy-Guided Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23266v1</link><description>This paper proposes a novel inverse reinforcement learning framework using a diffusion-based adaptive lookahead planner (IRL-DAL) for autonomous vehicles. Training begins with imitation from an expert finite state machine (FSM) controller to provide a stable initialization. Environment terms are combined with an IRL discriminator signal to align with expert goals. Reinforcement learning (RL) is then performed with a hybrid reward that combines diffuse environmental feedback and targeted IRL rewards. A conditional diffusion model, which acts as a safety supervisor, plans safe paths. It stays in its lane, avoids obstacles, and moves smoothly. Then, a learnable adaptive mask (LAM) improves perception. It shifts visual attention based on vehicle speed and nearby hazards. After FSM-based imitation, the policy is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Training is run in the Webots simulator with a two-stage curriculum. A 96\% success rate is reached, and collisions are reduced to 0.05 per 1k steps, marking a new benchmark for safe navigation. By applying the proposed approach, the agent not only drives in lane but also handles unsafe conditions at an expert level, increasing robustness.We make our code publicly available.</description><author>Seyed Ahmad Hosseini Miangoleh, Amin Jalal Aghdasian, Farzaneh Abdollahi</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:34:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23266v1</guid></item><item><title>PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23265v1</link><description>Despite rapid advances in autonomous AI scientists powered by language models, generating publication-ready illustrations remains a labor-intensive bottleneck in the research workflow.

We present TEON's improved convergence guarantee over layer-wise Muon, and further develop a practical instantiation of TEON based on the theoretical analysis with corresponding ablation. We evaluate our approach on two widely adopted architectures: GPT-style models, ranging from 130M to 774M parameters, and LLaMA-style models, ranging from 60M to 1B parameters.

Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train models on different multilingual mixtures and analyze their internal mechanisms using Cross-Layer Transcoders (CLTs) and Attribution Graphs. Our results reveal multilingual shared representations: the model employs highly similar features across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Training models without English shows identical multilingual shared space structures. Decoding relies partly on a small set of high-frequency features in the final layers, which linearly encode language identity from early layers. Intervening on these features allows one language to be suppressed and another substituted. Finally, to explain non-English failures, we perform a Model-Diffing experiment: underperformance arises from dim late-layer features, weak middle-layer clusters, and tokenizer bias toward English that forces early layers to specialize in word reassembly. Finetuning strengthens these features and their links, improving token assembly and language-specific decoding, providing a mechanistic explanation for multilingual gaps.

In this work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as superoptimizers, generating assembly programs that outperform code already optimized by industry-standard compilers. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for this problem, consisting of 8,072 assembly programs averaging 130 lines, in contrast to prior datasets restricted to 2-15 straight-line, loop-free programs. We evaluate 23 LLMs on this benchmark and find that the strongest baseline, Claude-opus-4, achieves a 51.5% test-passing rate and a 1.43x average speedup over gcc -O3. To further enhance performance, we fine-tune models with reinforcement learning, optimizing a reward function that integrates correctness and performance speedup. Starting from Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct (61.4% correctness, 1.10x speedup), the fine-tuned model SuperCoder attains 95.0% correctness and 1.46x average speedup, with additional improvement enabled by Best-of-N sampling and iterative refinement. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that LLMs can be applied as superoptimizers for assembly programs, establishing a foundation for future research in program performance optimization beyond compiler heuristics.</description><author>Anjiang Wei, Tarun Suresh, Huanmi Tan, Yinglun Xu, Gagandeep Singh, Ke Wang, Alex Aiken</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:27:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11480v3</guid></item><item><title>Geometric-disentangelment Unlearning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17100v3</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) can internalize private or harmful content, motivating unlearning that removes a forget set while preserving retaining knowledge. However, forgetting updates often cause collateral degradation on retaining knowledge, creating a persistent trade-off. Existing LLM unlearning methods are often heuristic, and other theoretical approaches rely on offline feature constructions that do not capture update-time forget-retain interaction in LLMs. To address this limitation, we aim to develop an LLM unlearning method that reduces the forget-retain trade-off with theoretical guarantees. We take a first-principles view by formalizing "no side effects" as local retain invariance under small parameter updates, and prove an equivalence under optimizer-induced geometry: the retain loss is locally invariant if and only if the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients. Based on the insight, we propose Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU), a lightweight and theoretically grounded projection that can be plug-and-play to existing gradient-based unlearning methods to mitigate forget-retain side effects. Experiments on TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP-cyber show that GU strengthens forgetting while reducing retain drift. When added to SimNPO, it achieves up to 62\% improved forgetting Extraction Strength (ES) and 31\% higher retain ES.

This transition, however, introduces a distinct class of vulnerabilities that remain largely uncharacterized. We examine the security implications of this modality shift by designing a text-to-audio jailbreak that embeds disallowed directives within a narrative-style audio stream. The attack leverages an advanced instruction-following text-to-speech (TTS) model to exploit structural and acoustic properties, thereby circumventing safety mechanisms primarily calibrated for text. When delivered through synthetic speech, the narrative format elicits restricted outputs from state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash, achieving a 98.26% success rate that substantially exceeds text-only baselines.

Existing test-time adaptation methods are computationally intensive, rely on back-propagation, and often focus on single modalities. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Test-Time Adaptation with Brownian Distance Covariance (TaTa). TaTa leverages Brownian Distance Covariance-a powerful statistical measure that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies via pairwise distances-to dynamically adapt VLMs to new domains without training or back-propagation. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances stability by avoiding disruptive weight updates. TaTa further integrates attribute-enhanced prompting to improve vision-language inference with descriptive visual cues. Combined with dynamic clustering and pseudo-label refinement, it effectively recalibrates the model for novel visual contexts. Experiments across diverse datasets show that TaTa significantly reduces computational cost while achieving state-of-the-art performance in domain and cross-dataset generalization.</description><author>Yi Zhang, Chun-Wun Cheng, Angelica I.

Nested Sampling is a robust alternative to standard MCMC, yet its typically sequential structure and hard constraints make efficient accelerator implementations difficult. This paper introduces Nested Slice Sampling (NSS), a GPU-friendly, vectorized formulation of Nested Sampling that uses Hit-and-Run Slice Sampling for constrained updates. A tuning analysis yields a simple near-optimal rule for setting the slice width, improving high-dimensional behavior and making per-step compute more predictable for parallel execution. Experiments on challenging synthetic targets, high dimensional Bayesian inference, and Gaussian process hyperparameter marginalization show that NSS maintains accurate evidence estimates and high-quality posterior samples, and is particularly robust on difficult multimodal problems where current state-of-the-art methods such as tempered SMC baselines can struggle.

We hypothesize that the pedagogically-structured content of educational videos provides an ideal training signal for improving these capabilities. We introduce DoraVQA, a dataset of 5,344 question-answer pairs automatically extracted from 8 seasons of Dora the Explorer with precise timestamp alignment. Each episode follows a consistent \textit{context-question-pause-answer} structure that creates a self-contained learning environment analogous to interactive tutoring. We fine-tune both Qwen2 and Qwen3 using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), leveraging the clear correctness signals and structured reasoning traces inherent in educational content. Despite training exclusively on 38 hours of children's educational videos, our approach achieves improvements of 8-14 points on DoraVQA and state-of-the-art 86.16\% on CVBench, with strong transfer to Video-MME and NExT-QA, demonstrating effective generalization from narrow pedagogical content to broad multimodal understanding. Through cross-domain benchmarks, we show that VLMs can perform tasks that require robust reasoning learned from structured educational content, suggesting that content structure matters as much as content scale.</description><author>Bishoy Galoaa, Xiangyu Bai, Sarah Ostadabbas</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:20:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23251v1</guid></item><item><title>LightRetriever: A LLM-based Text Retrieval Architecture with Extremely Faster Query Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12260v5</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs)-based text retrieval retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel LLM-based retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a full LLM on an A800 GPU, our method achieves over 1000x speedup in query encoding and over 10x increase in end-to-end retrieval throughput. Extensive experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks show that LightRetriever generalizes well across diverse tasks, maintaining an average of 95% retrieval performance.</description><author>Guangyuan Ma, Yongliang Ma, Xuanrui Gou, Zhenpeng Su, Ming Zhou, Songlin Hu</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:19:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12260v5</guid></item><item><title>The Mean-Field Dynamics of Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01868v4</link><description>We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits.

We propose a general multi-state joint modeling framework that unifies longitudinal biomarker dynamics with multi-state time-to-event processes defined on arbitrary directed graphs. The proposed framework also accomodates nonlinear longitudinal submodels and scalable inference via stochastic gradient descent. This formulation encompasses both Markovian and semi-Markovian transition structures, allowing recurrent cycles and terminal absorptions to be naturally represented. The longitudinal and event processes are linked through shared latent structures within nonlinear mixed-effects models, extending classical joint modeling formulations. We derive the complete likelihood, model selection criteria, and develop scalable inference procedures based on stochastic gradient descent to enable high-dimensional and large-scale applications. In addition, we formulate a dynamic prediction framework that provides individualized state-transition probabilities and personalized risk assessments along complex event trajectories. Through simulation and application to the PAQUID cohort, we demonstrate accurate parameter recovery and individualized prediction.</description><author>Félix Laplante, Christophe Ambroise</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:10:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07128v3</guid></item><item><title>Graph Attention Network for Node Regression on Random Geometric Graphs with Erdős--Rényi contamination</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23239v1</link><description>Graph attention networks (GATs) are widely used and often appear robust to noise in node covariates and edges, yet rigorous statistical guarantees demonstrating a provable advantage of GATs over non-attention graph neural networks~(GNNs) are scarce. We partially address this gap for node regression with graph-based errors-in-variables models under simultaneous covariate and edge corruption: responses are generated from latent node-level covariates, but only noise-perturbed versions of the latent covariates are observed; and the sample graph is a random geometric graph created from the node covariates but contaminated by independent Erdős--Rényi edges. We propose and analyze a carefully designed, task-specific GAT that constructs denoised proxy features for regression. We prove that regressing the response variables on the proxies achieves lower error asymptotically in (a) estimating the regression coefficient compared to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator on the noisy node covariates, and (b) predicting the response for an unlabelled node compared to a vanilla graph convolutional network~(GCN) -- under mild growth conditions. Our analysis leverages high-dimensional geometric tail bounds and concentration for neighbourhood counts and sample covariances. We verify our theoretical findings through experiments on synthetically generated data.

Their scraping bots harvest content at an unprecedented scale, circumventing technical barriers to fuel billion-dollar models while creators receive nothing. Courts have enabled this exploitation by misunderstanding what property rights protect online. The prevailing view treats websites as mere repositories of intellectual property and dismisses trespass claims absent server damage. That framework grants AI companies presumptive access while ignoring the economic devastation they inflict. But the content is severable from the website itself. This paper reframes the debate: websites are personal property as integrated digital assets subject to the same exclusionary rights as physical chattels. When scrapers bypass access controls and divert traffic that sustains a website's value, they commit actionable trespass. The law need not create new protections; it need only apply existing property principles to digital space. Courts and litigants have struggled to police unwanted, large-scale scraping because copyright preemption often narrows available claims, leaving copyright and its fair use defense as the primary battleground. Trespass to chattels offers a superior path, grounded in the fundamental right to exclude unwanted intrusions. Reviving this tort would protect not only content creators but also the digital ecosystem. Such protection would discourage exploitative scraping, preserve incentives for content creation, help protect privacy and personal data, and safeguard autonomy and expression. Reaffirming website owners' right to exclude is essential to maintaining a fair and sustainable online environment.</description><author>David Atkinson</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:04:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16049v2</guid></item><item><title>Sequence Diffusion Model for Temporal Link Prediction in Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23233v1</link><description>Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a fundamental problem in many real-world systems. Existing temporal graph neural networks mainly focus on learning representations of historical interactions. Despite their strong performance, these models are still purely discriminative, producing point estimates for future links and lacking an explicit mechanism to capture the uncertainty and sequential structure of future temporal interactions. In this paper, we propose SDG, a novel sequence-level diffusion framework that unifies dynamic graph learning with generative denoising. Specifically, SDG injects noise into the entire historical interaction sequence and jointly reconstructs all interaction embeddings through a conditional denoising process, thereby enabling the model to capture more comprehensive interaction distributions. To align the generative process with temporal link prediction, we employ a cross-attention denoising decoder to guide the reconstruction of the destination sequence and optimize the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on various temporal graph benchmarks show that SDG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the temporal link prediction task.</description><author>Nguyen Minh Duc, Viet Cuong Ta</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:02:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23233v1</guid></item><item><title>ShotFinder: Imagination-Driven Open-Domain Video Shot Retrieval via Web Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23232v1</link><description>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in information retrieval, yet existing research has mainly focused on text or static multimodal settings. Open-domain video shot retrieval, which involves richer temporal structure and more complex semantics, still lacks systematic benchmarks and analysis. To fill this gap, we introduce ShotFinder, a benchmark that formalizes editing requirements as keyframe-oriented shot descriptions and introduces five types of controllable single-factor constraints: Temporal order, Color, Visual style, Audio, and Resolution. We curate 1,210 high-quality samples from YouTube across 20 thematic categories, using large models for generation with human verification. Based on the benchmark, we propose ShotFinder, a text-driven three-stage retrieval and localization pipeline: (1) query expansion via video imagination, (2) candidate video retrieval with a search engine, and (3) description-guided temporal localization. Experiments on multiple closed-source and open-source models reveal a significant gap to human performance, with clear imbalance across constraints: temporal localization is relatively tractable, while color and visual style remain major challenges. These results reveal that open-domain video shot retrieval is still a critical capability that multimodal large models have yet to overcome.</description><author>Tao Yu, Haopeng Jin, Hao Wang, Shenghua Chai, Yujia Yang, Junhao Gong, Jiaming Guo, Minghui Zhang, Xinlong Chen, Zhenghao Zhang, Yuxuan Zhou, Yanpei Gong, YuanCheng Liu, Yiming Ding, Kangwei Zeng, Pengfei Yang, Zhongtian Luo, Yufei Xiong, Shanbin Zhang, Shaoxiong Cheng, Huang Ruilin, Li Shuo, Yuxi Niu, Xinyuan Zhang, Yueya Xu, Jie Mao, Ruixuan Ji, Yaru Zhao, Mingchen Zhang, Jiabing Yang, Jiaqi Liu, YiFan Zhang, Hongzhu Yi, Xinming Wang, Cheng Zhong, Xiao Ma, Zhang Zhang, Yan Huang, Liang Wang</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:01:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23232v1</guid></item><item><title>LLM-42: Enabling Determinism in LLM Inference with Verified Speculation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17768v2</link><description>In LLM inference, the same prompt may yield different outputs across different runs. At the system level, this non-determinism arises from floating-point non-associativity combined with dynamic batching and GPU kernels whose reduction orders vary with batch size. A straightforward way to eliminate non-determinism is to disable dynamic batching during inference, but doing so severely degrades throughput. Another approach is to make kernels batch-invariant; however, this tightly couples determinism to kernel design, requiring new implementations. This coupling also imposes fixed runtime overheads, regardless of how much of the workload actually requires determinism. Inspired by ideas from speculative decoding, we present LLM-42, a scheduling-based approach to enable determinism in LLM inference. Our key observation is that if a sequence is in a consistent state, the next emitted token is likely to be consistent even with dynamic batching. Moreover, most GPU kernels use shape-consistent reductions. Leveraging these insights, LLM-42 decodes tokens using a non-deterministic fast path and enforces determinism via a lightweight verify-rollback loop. The verifier replays candidate tokens under a fixed-shape reduction schedule, commits those that are guaranteed to be consistent across runs, and rolls back those violating determinism. LLM-42 mostly re-uses existing kernels unchanged and incurs overhead only in proportion to the traffic that requires determinism.</description><author>Raja Gond, Aditya K Kamath, Ramachandran Ramjee, Ashish Panwar</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:59:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17768v2</guid></item><item><title>Solving Inverse Problems with Flow-based Models via Model Predictive Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23231v1</link><description>Flow-based generative models provide strong unconditional priors for inverse problems, but guiding their dynamics for conditional generation remains challenging.

Robust MDPs (RMDPs) extend this framework by allowing uncertainty in transition probabilities and optimizing against the worst-case realization of that uncertainty. In particular, $(s, a)$-rectangular RMDPs with $L_\infty$ uncertainty sets form a fundamental and expressive model: they subsume classical MDPs and turn-based stochastic games. We consider this model with discounted payoffs. The existence of polynomial and strongly-polynomial time algorithms is a fundamental problem for these optimization models. For MDPs, linear programming yields polynomial-time algorithms for any arbitrary discount factor, and the seminal work of Ye established strongly--polynomial time for a fixed discount factor. The generalization of such results to RMDPs has remained an important open problem. In this work, we show that a robust policy iteration algorithm runs in strongly-polynomial time for $(s, a)$-rectangular $L_\infty$ RMDPs with a constant (fixed) discount factor, resolving an important algorithmic question.</description><author>Ali Asadi, Krishnendu Chatterjee, Ehsan Goharshady, Mehrdad Karrabi, Alipasha Montaseri, Carlo Pagano</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:57:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23229v1</guid></item><item><title>Scaling Multiagent Systems with Process Rewards</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23228v1</link><description>While multiagent systems have shown promise for tackling complex tasks via specialization, finetuning multiple agents simultaneously faces two key challenges: (1) credit assignment across agents, and (2) sample efficiency of expensive multiagent rollouts. In this work, we propose finetuning multiagent systems with per-action process rewards from AI feedback (MAPPA) to address both. Through assigning credit to individual agent actions rather than only at task completion, MAPPA enables fine-grained supervision without ground truth labels while extracting maximal training signal from each rollout. We demonstrate our approach on competition math problems and tool-augmented data analysis tasks. On unseen math problems, MAPPA achieves +5.0--17.5pp on AIME and +7.8--17.2pp on AMC. For data analysis tasks, our method improves success rate by +12.5pp while quality metrics improve by up to 30%, validating that per-action supervision can lead to improvements across different multiagent system on various domains. By addressing these challenges, our work takes a first step toward scaling multiagent systems for complex, long-horizon tasks with minimal human supervision.</description><author>Ed Li, Junyu Ren, Cat Yan</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:55:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23228v1</guid></item><item><title>Agile Reinforcement Learning through Separable Neural Architecture</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23225v1</link><description>Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly deployed in resource-constrained environments, yet the go-to function approximators - multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) - are often parameter-inefficient due to an imperfect inductive bias for the smooth structure of many value functions. This mismatch can also hinder sample efficiency and slow policy learning in this capacity-limited regime. Although model compression techniques exist, they operate post-hoc and do not improve learning efficiency. Recent spline-based separable architectures - such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) - have been shown to offer parameter efficiency but are widely reported to exhibit significant computational overhead, especially at scale. In seeking to address these limitations, this work introduces SPAN (SPline-based Adaptive Networks), a novel function approximation approach to RL. SPAN adapts the low rank KHRONOS framework by integrating a learnable preprocessing layer with a separable tensor product B-spline basis. SPAN is evaluated across discrete (PPO) and high-dimensional continuous (SAC) control tasks, as well as offline settings (Minari/D4RL). Empirical results demonstrate that SPAN achieves a 30-50% improvement in sample efficiency and 1.3-9 times higher success rates across benchmarks compared to MLP baselines. Furthermore, SPAN demonstrates superior anytime performance and robustness to hyperparameter variations, suggesting it as a viable, high performance alternative for learning intrinsically efficient policies in resource-limited settings.</description><author>Rajib Mostakim, Reza T.

We introduce Video-o3, a novel framework that supports iterative discovery of salient visual clues, fine-grained inspection of key segments, and adaptive termination once sufficient evidence is acquired. Technically, we address two core challenges in interleaved tool invocation. First, to mitigate attention dispersion induced by the heterogeneity of reasoning and tool-calling, we propose Task-Decoupled Attention Masking, which isolates per-step concentration while preserving shared global context. Second, to control context length growth in multi-turn interactions, we introduce a Verifiable Trajectory-Guided Reward that balances exploration coverage with reasoning efficiency. To support training at scale, we further develop a data synthesis pipeline and construct Seeker-173K, comprising 173K high-quality tool-interaction trajectories for effective supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments show that Video-o3 substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 72.1% accuracy on MLVU and 46.5% on Video-Holmes. These results demonstrate Video-o3's strong multi-hop evidence-seeking and reasoning capabilities, and validate the effectiveness of native tool invocation in long-video scenarios.</description><author>Xiangyu Zeng, Zhiqiu Zhang, Yuhan Zhu, Xinhao Li, Zikang Wang, Changlian Ma, Qingyu Zhang, Zizheng Huang, Kun Ouyang, Tianxiang Jiang, Ziang Yan, Yi Wang, Hongjie Zhang, Yali Wang, Limin Wang</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:47:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23224v1</guid></item><item><title>Are you going to finish that? A Practical Study of the Tokenization Boundary Problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23223v1</link><description>Language models (LMs) are trained over sequences of tokens, whereas users interact with LMs via text. This mismatch gives rise to the partial token problem, which occurs when a user ends their prompt in the middle of the expected next-token, leading to distorted next-token predictions. Although this issue has been studied using arbitrary character prefixes, its prevalence and severity in realistic prompts respecting word boundaries remains underexplored. In this work, we identify three domains where token and "word" boundaries often do not line up: languages that do not use whitespace, highly compounding languages, and code. In Chinese, for example, up to 25% of word boundaries do not line up with token boundaries, making even natural, word-complete prompts susceptible to this problem. We systematically construct semantically natural prompts ending with a partial tokens; in experiments, we find that they comprise a serious failure mode: frontier LMs consistently place three orders of magnitude less probability on the correct continuation compared to when the prompt is "backed-off" to be token-aligned. This degradation does not diminish with scale and often worsens for larger models. Finally, we evaluate inference-time mitigations to the partial token problem and validate the effectiveness of recent exact solutions. Overall, we demonstrate the scale and severity of probability distortion caused by tokenization in realistic use cases, and provide practical recommentions for model inference providers.</description><author>Hao Xu, Alisa Liu, Jonathan Hayase, Yejin Choi, Noah A.

In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited. Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models, that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing, reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still yields competitive performance.</description><author>Jonas Ammeling, Jonathan Ganz, Emely Rosbach, Ludwig Lausser, Christof A.

In contrast, many deployed systems already produce inexpensive automatic quality-control (QC) signals like model agreement, uncertainty measures, or learned mask-quality scores which can be used for further model training without additional ground-truth annotation. However, these signals can be noisy and biased, making preference-based fine-tuning susceptible to harmful updates. We study Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for segmentation from such noisy judges using proposals generated by a supervised base segmenter trained on a small labeled set. We find that outcomes depend strongly on how preference pairs are mined: selecting the judge's top-ranked proposal can improve peak performance when the judge is reliable, but can amplify harmful errors under weaker judges. We propose Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO), a segmentation-aware objective which normalizes preference updates by the size of the disagreement region between masks, reducing the leverage of harmful comparisons and improving optimization stability. Across two medical datasets and multiple regimes, RN-DPO improves sustained performance and stabilizes preference-based fine-tuning, outperforming standard DPO and strong baselines without requiring additional pixel annotations.</description><author>Hamza Kalisch, Constantin Seibold, Jens Kleesiek, Ken Herrmann, Frederic Jonske</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:45:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23222v1</guid></item><item><title>Optimal Fair Aggregation of Crowdsourced Noisy Labels using Demographic Parity Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23221v1</link><description>As acquiring reliable ground-truth labels is usually costly, or infeasible, crowdsourcing and aggregation of noisy human annotations is the typical resort. Aggregating subjective labels, though, may amplify individual biases, particularly regarding sensitive features, raising fairness concerns. Nonetheless, fairness in crowdsourced aggregation remains largely unexplored, with no existing convergence guarantees and only limited post-processing approaches for enforcing $\varepsilon$-fairness under demographic parity. We address this gap by analyzing the fairness s of crowdsourced aggregation methods within the $\varepsilon$-fairness framework, for Majority Vote and Optimal Bayesian aggregation. In the small-crowd regime, we derive an upper bound on the fairness gap of Majority Vote in terms of the fairness gaps of the individual annotators. We further show that the fairness gap of the aggregated consensus converges exponentially fast to that of the ground-truth under interpretable conditions. Since ground-truth itself may still be unfair, we generalize a state-of-the-art multiclass fairness post-processing algorithm from the continuous to the discrete setting, which enforces strict demographic parity constraints to any aggregation rule. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and corroborate the theoretical insights.</description><author>Gabriel Singer, Samuel Gruffaz, Olivier Vo Van, Nicolas Vayatis, Argyris Kalogeratos</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:45:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23221v1</guid></item><item><title>Med-Scout: Curing MLLMs' Geometric Blindness in Medical Perception via Geometry-Aware RL Post-Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23220v1</link><description>Despite recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)' linguistic prowess in medical diagnosis, we find even state-of-the-art MLLMs suffer from a critical perceptual deficit: geometric blindness. This failure to ground outputs in objective geometric constraints leads to plausible yet factually incorrect hallucinations, rooted in training paradigms that prioritize linguistic fluency over geometric fidelity. This paper introduces Med-Scout, a novel framework that "cures" this blindness via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that leverages the intrinsic geometric logic latent within unlabeled medical images. Instead of relying on costly expert annotations, Med-Scout derives verifiable supervision signals through three strategic proxy tasks: Hierarchical Scale Localization, Topological Jigsaw Reconstruction, and Anomaly Consistency Detection. To rigorously quantify this deficit, we present Med-Scout-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate geometric perception. Extensive evaluations show that Med-Scout significantly mitigates geometric blindness, outperforming leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs by over 40% on our benchmark. Furthermore, this enhanced geometric perception generalizes to broader medical understanding, achieving superior results on radiological and comprehensive medical VQA tasks.</description><author>Anglin Liu, Ruichao Chen, Yi Lu, Hongxia Xu, Jintai Chen</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:45:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23220v1</guid></item><item><title>MonoScale: Scaling Multi-Agent System with Monotonic Improvement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23219v1</link><description>In recent years, LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have advanced rapidly, using a router to decompose tasks and delegate subtasks to specialized agents. A natural way to expand capability is to scale up the agent pool by continually integrating new functional agents or tool interfaces, but naive expansion can trigger performance collapse when the router cold-starts on newly added, heterogeneous, and unreliable agents. We propose MonoScale, an expansion-aware update framework that proactively generates a small set of agent-conditioned familiarization tasks, harvests evidence from both successful and failed interactions, and distills it into auditable natural-language memory to guide future routing. We formalize sequential augmentation as a contextual bandit and perform trust-region memory updates, yielding a monotonic non-decreasing performance guarantee across onboarding rounds. Experiments on GAIA and Humanity's Last Exam show stable gains as the agent pool grows, outperforming naive scale-up and strong-router fixed-pool baselines.</description><author>Shuai Shao, Yixiang Liu, Bingwei Lu, Weinan Zhang</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:44:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23219v1</guid></item><item><title>Tackling air quality with SAPIENS</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23215v1</link><description>Air pollution is a chronic problem in large cities worldwide and awareness is rising as the long-term health implications become clearer. Vehicular traffic has been identified as a major contributor to poor air quality. In a lot of cities the publicly available air quality measurements and forecasts are coarse-grained both in space and time. However, in general, real-time traffic intensity data is openly available in various forms and is fine-grained. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of pollution sensor measurements combined with traffic data from Mexico City. We analyse and model the relationship between traffic intensity and air quality with the aim to provide hyper-local, dynamic air quality forecasts. We developed an innovative method to represent traffic intensities by transforming simple colour-coded traffic maps into concentric ring-based descriptions, enabling improved characterisation of traffic conditions. Using Partial Least Squares Regression, we predict pollution levels based on these newly defined traffic intensities. The model was optimised with various training samples to achieve the best predictive performance and gain insights into the relationship between pollutants and traffic.

Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently gained much attention due to their ability to generate diverse and high-quality samples in many computer vision tasks, as well as to incorporate flexible model architectures and a relatively simple training scheme. Quantum generative models, empowered by entanglement and superposition, have brought new insight to learning classical and quantum data. Inspired by the classical counterpart, we propose the quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model (QuDDPM) to enable efficiently trainable generative learning of quantum data. QuDDPM adopts sufficient layers of circuits to guarantee expressivity, while it introduces multiple intermediate training tasks as interpolation between the target distribution and noise to avoid barren plateau and guarantee efficient training. We provide bounds on the learning error and demonstrate QuDDPM's capability in learning correlated quantum noise model, quantum many-body phases, and topological structure of quantum data. The results provide a paradigm for versatile and efficient quantum generative learning.</description><author>Bingzhi Zhang, Peng Xu, Xiaohui Chen, Quntao Zhuang</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:41:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05866v5</guid></item><item><title>Disentangling multispecific antibody function with graph neural networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23212v1</link><description>Multispecific antibodies offer transformative therapeutic potential by engaging multiple epitopes simultaneously, yet their efficacy is an emergent property governed by complex molecular architectures. Rational design is often bottlenecked by the inability to predict how subtle changes in domain topology influence functional outcomes, a challenge exacerbated by the scarcity of comprehensive experimental data. Here, we introduce a computational framework to address part of this gap. First, we present a generative method for creating large-scale, realistic synthetic functional landscapes that capture non-linear interactions where biological activity depends on domain connectivity. Second, we propose a graph neural network architecture that explicitly encodes these topological constraints, distinguishing between format configurations that appear identical to sequence-only models. We demonstrate that this model, trained on synthetic landscapes, recapitulates complex functional properties and, via transfer learning, has the potential to achieve high predictive accuracy on limited biological datasets. We showcase the model's utility by optimizing trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity in trispecific T-cell engagers and retrieving optimal common light chains.

We develop a precise high-dimensional analysis of masked modeling objectives in the proportional regime where the number of samples scales with the ambient dimension. Our results provide explicit expressions for the generalization error and characterize the spectral structure of the learned predictor, revealing how masked modeling extracts structure from data. For spiked covariance models, we show that the joint predictor undergoes a Baik--Ben Arous--Péché (BBP)-type phase transition, identifying when masked SSL begins to recover latent signals.

First, we train an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to execute the local instructions of a single node. Second, during inference, we use the trained MLP ensemble as the update function within a graph neural network (GNN). Leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, we show that local instructions can be learned from a small training set, enabling the complete graph algorithm to be executed during inference without error and with high probability. To illustrate the learning power of our setting, we establish a rigorous learnability result for the LOCAL model of distributed computation. We further demonstrate positive learnability results for widely studied algorithms such as message flooding, breadth-first and depth-first search, and Bellman-Ford.</description><author>Muhammad Fetrat Qharabagh, Artur Back de Luca, George Giapitzakis, Kimon Fountoulakis</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:31:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23207v1</guid></item><item><title>High-quality generation of dynamic game content via small language models: A proof of concept</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23206v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) offer promise for dynamic game content generation, but they face critical barriers, including narrative incoherence and high operational costs. Due to their large size, they are often accessed in the cloud, limiting their application in offline games. Many of these practical issues are solved by pivoting to small language models (SLMs), but existing studies using SLMs have resulted in poor output quality. We propose a strategy of achieving high-quality SLM generation through aggressive fine-tuning on deliberately scoped tasks with narrow context, constrained structure, or both. In short, more difficult tasks require narrower scope and higher specialization to the training corpus. Training data is synthetically generated via a DAG-based approach, grounding models in the specific game world. Such models can form the basis for agentic networks designed around the narratological framework at hand, representing a more practical and robust solution than cloud-dependent LLMs. To validate this approach, we present a proof-of-concept focusing on a single specialized SLM as the fundamental building block. We introduce a minimal RPG loop revolving around rhetorical battles of reputations, powered by this model. We demonstrate that a simple retry-until-success strategy reaches adequate quality (as defined by an LLM-as-a-judge scheme) with predictable latency suitable for real-time generation.

Our approach directly learns a per-pixel Gaussian representation from the input images, and aggregates multi-view information using a transformer-based encoder that fuses image features from both DINOv3 and Stable Diffusion VAE. For real-time animation, we extend the explicit Gaussian representations with per-Gaussian features and introduce a lightweight MLP-based dynamic network to predict 3D Gaussian deformations from expression codes. Furthermore, to enhance geometric smoothness of the 3D head, we employ point maps from a pre-trained large reconstruction model as geometry supervision.

Preference optimization, which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments. This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization, providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise, such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.</description><author>Shawn Im, Sharon Li</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:15:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01458v3</guid></item><item><title>Deep Search with Hierarchical Meta-Cognitive Monitoring Inspired by Cognitive Neuroscience</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23188v1</link><description>Deep search agents powered by large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in multi-step retrieval, reasoning, and long-horizon task execution.

Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that human metacognition is hierarchically organized, integrating fast anomaly detection with selectively triggered, experience-driven reflection. In this work, we propose Deep Search with Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (DS-MCM), a deep search framework augmented with an explicit hierarchical metacognitive monitoring mechanism. DS-MCM integrates a Fast Consistency Monitor, which performs lightweight checks on the alignment between external evidence and internal reasoning confidence, and a Slow Experience-Driven Monitor, which is selectively activated to guide corrective intervention based on experience memory from historical agent trajectories. By embedding monitoring directly into the reasoning-retrieval loop, DS-MCM determines both when intervention is warranted and how corrective actions should be informed by prior experience. Experiments across multiple deep search benchmarks and backbone models demonstrate that DS-MCM consistently improves performance and robustness.</description><author>Zhongxiang Sun, Qipeng Wang, Weijie Yu, Jingxuan Yang, Haolang Lu, Jun Xu</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:10:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23188v1</guid></item><item><title>RefineBridge: Generative Bridge Models Improve Financial Forecasting by Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21572v2</link><description>Financial time series forecasting is particularly challenging for transformer-based time series foundation models (TSFMs) due to non-stationarity, heavy-tailed distributions, and high-frequency noise present in data.

To further enhance TSFMs, we propose a novel refinement module, RefineBridge, built upon a tractable Schrödinger Bridge (SB) generative framework. Given the forecasts of TSFM as generative prior and the observed ground truths as targets, RefineBridge learns context-conditioned stochastic transport maps to improve TSFM predictions, iteratively approaching the ground-truth target from even a low-quality prior. Simulations on multiple financial benchmarks demonstrate that RefineBridge consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art TSFMs across different prediction horizons.</description><author>Anthony Bolton, Wuyang Zhou, Zehua Chen, Giorgos Iacovides, Danilo Mandic</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:09:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21572v2</guid></item><item><title>ReGuLaR: Variational Latent Reasoning Guided by Rendered Chain-of-Thought</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23184v1</link><description>While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) significantly enhances the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), explicit reasoning chains introduce substantial computational redundancy. Recent latent reasoning methods attempt to mitigate this by compressing reasoning processes into latent space, but often suffer from severe performance degradation due to the lack of appropriate compression guidance. In this study, we propose Rendered CoT-Guided variational Latent Reasoning (ReGuLaR), a simple yet novel latent learning paradigm resolving this issue. Fundamentally, we formulate latent reasoning within the Variational Auto-Encoding (VAE) framework, sampling the current latent reasoning state from the posterior distribution conditioned on previous ones. Specifically, when learning this variational latent reasoning model, we render explicit reasoning chains as images, from which we extract dense visual-semantic representations to regularize the posterior distribution, thereby achieving efficient compression with minimal information loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReGuLaR significantly outperforms existing latent reasoning methods across both computational efficiency and reasoning effectiveness, and even surpasses CoT through multi-modal reasoning, providing a new and insightful solution to latent reasoning.

Based on this observation, we propose FourierSampler, which leverages a frequency-domain sliding window mechanism to dynamically guide the model to achieve a "structure-to-detail" generation. FourierSampler outperforms other inference enhancement strategies on LLADA and SDAR, achieving relative improvements of 20.4% on LLaDA1.5-8B and 16.0% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct.

So far, a precise theoretical explanation for the mechanism of encoding semantics of data into network weights is still missing. In this work, we deploy the Implicit Function Theorem (IFT) to establish a rigorous mapping between the data space and its latent weight representation space.

Speculative decoding (SD) offers a powerful solution, providing significant speed-ups through its lightweight drafting and parallel verification mechanism. While existing work has nearly saturated improvements in draft effectiveness and efficiency, this paper advances SD from a new yet critical perspective: the verification cost. We propose TriSpec, a novel ternary SD framework that, at its core, introduces a lightweight proxy to significantly reduce computational cost by approving easily verifiable draft sequences and engaging the full target model only when encountering uncertain tokens. TriSpec can be integrated with state-of-the-art SD methods like EAGLE-3 to further reduce verification costs, achieving greater acceleration. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen/LLaMA families show that TriSpec achieves up to 35\% speedup over standard SD, with up to 50\% fewer target model invocations while maintaining comparable accuracy.</description><author>Haoyun Jiang, Junqi He, Feng Hong, Xinlong Yang, Jianwei Zhang, Zheng Li, Zhengyang Zhuge, Zhiyong Chen, Bo Han, Junyang Lin, Jiangchao Yao</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:04:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23180v1</guid></item><item><title>Make Anything Match Your Target: Universal Adversarial Perturbations against Closed-Source MLLMs via Multi-Crop Routed Meta Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23179v1</link><description>Targeted adversarial attacks on closed-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been increasingly explored under black-box transfer, yet prior methods are predominantly sample-specific and offer limited reusability across inputs. We instead study a more stringent setting, Universal Targeted Transferable Adversarial Attacks (UTTAA), where a single perturbation must consistently steer arbitrary inputs toward a specified target across unknown commercial MLLMs. Naively adapting existing sample-wise attacks to this universal setting faces three core difficulties: (i) target supervision becomes high-variance due to target-crop randomness, (ii) token-wise matching is unreliable because universality suppresses image-specific cues that would otherwise anchor alignment, and (iii) few-source per-target adaptation is highly initialization-sensitive, which can degrade the attainable performance. In this work, we propose MCRMO-Attack, which stabilizes supervision via Multi-Crop Aggregation with an Attention-Guided Crop, improves token-level reliability through alignability-gated Token Routing, and meta-learns a cross-target perturbation prior that yields stronger per-target solutions. Across commercial MLLMs, we boost unseen-image attack success rate by +23.7\% on GPT-4o and +19.9\% on Gemini-2.0 over the strongest universal baseline.</description><author>Hui Lu, Yi Yu, Yiming Yang, Chenyu Yi, Xueyi Ke, Qixing Zhang, Bingquan Shen, Alex Kot, Xudong Jiang</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:03:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23179v1</guid></item><item><title>MeshGraphNet-Transformer: Scalable Mesh-based Learned Simulation for Solid Mechanics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23177v1</link><description>We present MeshGraphNet-Transformer (MGN-T), a novel architecture that combines the global modeling capabilities of Transformers with the geometric inductive bias of MeshGraphNets, while preserving a mesh-based graph representation. MGN-T overcomes a key limitation of standard MGN, the inefficient long-range information propagation caused by iterative message passing on large, high-resolution meshes. A physics-attention Transformer serves as a global processor, updating all nodal states simultaneously while explicitly retaining node and edge attributes. By directly capturing long-range physical interactions, MGN-T eliminates the need for deep message-passing stacks or hierarchical, coarsened meshes, enabling efficient learning on high-resolution meshes with varying geometries, topologies, and boundary conditions at an industrial scale. We demonstrate that MGN-T successfully handles industrial-scale meshes for impact dynamics, a setting in which standard MGN fails due message-passing under-reaching. The method accurately models self-contact, plasticity, and multivariate outputs, including internal, phenomenological plastic variables. Moreover, MGN-T outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on classical benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining practical efficiency, using only a fraction of the parameters required by competing baselines.</description><author>Mikel M.

Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the Best-of-N evaluation.

In this work, we introduce DyCAST, a Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenizer that enables variable-frame-rate tokenization through soft character-level alignment and explicit duration modeling. DyCAST learns to associate tokens with character-level linguistic units during training and supports alignment-free inference with direct control over token durations at decoding time. To improve speech resynthesis quality at low frame rates, we further introduce a retrieval-augmented decoding mechanism that enhances reconstruction fidelity without increasing bitrate. Experiments show that DyCAST achieves competitive speech resynthesis quality and downstream performance while using significantly fewer tokens than fixed-frame-rate codecs.</description><author>Luca Della Libera, Cem Subakan, Mirco Ravanelli</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:58:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23174v1</guid></item><item><title>From Next-Token to Next-Block: A Principled Adaptation Path for Diffusion LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06776v2</link><description>Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) enable fast generation, yet training large DLMs from scratch is costly. As a practical shortcut, adapting off-the-shelf Auto-Regressive (AR) model weights into a DLM could quickly equip the DLM with strong long-context generation capabilies. Prior "adaptation" attempts either modify logits or randomly grow attention masks to Full-Sequence diffusion, or simply transplant AR weights into a Block-Diffusion recipe, leaving two key questions unaddressed: where is the final destination of adaptation, and how to adapt better? For manifold benefits, we reframe the whole AR-to-DLM adaptation under the Block-Diffusion paradigm, transitioning from block size 1 to the final Block-Diffusion state. Concretely, the principled pathway of adaptation is designed as follows: we keep a context-causal path where causal attention is kept in the prefix, an efficient parallel adaptation procedure where an AR guidance is maintained, and gradual increment of the generation block size for a smoother transition. Built on these components, the adaptation is proved competitive on various models at different scales. With better adaptation, we propose NBDiff-7B that could inherit the long-context modeling and reasoning capabilities, and achieve state-of-the-art performance among the 7B-class DLMs. Codes: https://github.com/YuchuanTian/NBDiff.</description><author>Yuchuan Tian, Yuchen Liang, Shuo Zhang, Yingte Shu, Guangwen Yang, Wei He, Sibo Fang, Tianyu Guo, Kai Han, Chao Xu, Hanting Chen, Xinghao Chen, Yunhe Wang</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:55:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06776v2</guid></item><item><title>Names Don't Matter: Symbol-Invariant Transformer for Open-Vocabulary Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23169v1</link><description>Current neural architectures lack a principled way to handle interchangeable tokens, i.e., symbols that are semantically equivalent yet distinguishable, such as bound variables.

Existing iterative refinement methods in statement autoformalization typicall improve isolated aspects of formalization, such as syntactic correctness, but struggle to jointly optimizing multiple quality dimensions, which is critical for full-theorem autoformalization. We introduce a reference-free iterative monotonic process for full-theorem autoformalization that leverages complementary feedback from theorem provers and LLM-based judges, without access to ground-truth proofs or existing formalizations at inference time. Our approach optimizes a masked composite objective over Formal Validity, Logical Preservation, Mathematical Consistency, and Formal Quality, guided by a responsiveness map that indicates how different LLMs acting as different roles preferentially improve each dimension. We further propose an acceptance policy that guarantees certified monotonic improvement, and provide conditions ensuring convergence and termination.

While the mutual information between the response variable and model parameters is a principled measure for epistemic uncertainty, it requires access to the parameter posterior, which is computationally challenging to approximate. Consequently, practitioners often rely on probabilistic predictions from deep ensembles to quantify uncertainty, which have demonstrated strong empirical performance. However, a theoretical understanding of their success from a frequentist perspective remains limited. We address this gap by first considering a bootstrap-based estimator for epistemic uncertainty, which we prove is asymptotically correct. Next, we connect deep ensembles to the bootstrap estimator by decomposing it into data variability and training stochasticity; specifically, we show that deep ensembles capture the training stochasticity component. Through empirical studies, we show that this stochasticity component constitutes the majority of epistemic uncertainty, thereby explaining the effectiveness of deep ensembles.</description><author>Anchit Jain, Stephen Bates</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:47:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22063v2</guid></item><item><title>Stochastic Linear Bandits with Parameter Noise</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23164v1</link><description>We study the stochastic linear bandits with parameter noise model, in which the reward of action $a$ is $a^\top θ$ where $θ$ is sampled i.i.d.

We further provide a lower bound of $\widetildeΩ (d \sqrt{T σ^2_{\max}})$ which is tight (up to logarithmic factors) whenever $\log (K) \approx d$. For more specific action sets, $\ell_p$ unit balls with $p \leq 2$ and dual norm $q$, we show that the minimax regret is $\widetildeΘ (\sqrt{dT σ^2_q)}$, where $σ^2_q$ is a variance-dependent quantity that is always at most $4$.

However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic "reasoning style" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations.</description><author>Marthe Ballon, Brecht Verbeken, Vincent Ginis, Andres Algaba</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:45:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23163v1</guid></item><item><title>Understanding and Bridging the Planner-Coder Gap: A Systematic Study on the Robustness of Multi-Agent Systems for Code Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10460v2</link><description>Multi-agent systems (MASs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for automated code generation, demonstrating impressive performance on established benchmarks. Despite their prosperous development, the fundamental mechanisms underlying their robustness remain poorly understood, raising critical concerns for real-world deployment. This paper conducts a systematic empirical study to uncover the internal robustness flaws of MASs using a mutation-based methodology. By designing a testing pipeline incorporating semantic-preserving mutation operators and a novel fitness function, we assess mainstream MASs across multiple datasets and LLMs. Our findings reveal substantial robustness flaws: semantically equivalent inputs cause drastic performance drops, with MASs failing to solve 7.9\%--83.3\% of problems they initially resolved successfully. Through comprehensive failure analysis, we discover a fundamental cause underlying these robustness issues: the \textit{planner-coder gap}, which accounts for 75.3\% of failures. This gap arises from information loss in the multi-stage transformation process where planning agents decompose requirements into underspecified plans, and coding agents subsequently misinterpret intricate logic during code generation. Based on this formulated information transformation process, we propose a \textit{repairing method} that mitigates information loss through multi-prompt generation and introduces a monitor agent to bridge the planner-coder gap. Evaluation shows that our repairing method effectively enhances the robustness of MASs by solving 40.0\%--88.9\% of identified failures. Our work uncovers critical robustness flaws in MASs and provides effective mitigation strategies, contributing essential insights for developing more reliable MASs for code generation.</description><author>Zongyi Lyu, Songqiang Chen, Zhenlan Ji, Liwen Wang, Shuai Wang, Daoyuan Wu, Wenxuan Wang, Shing-Chi Cheung</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:44:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10460v2</guid></item><item><title>DIFFA-2: A Practical Diffusion Large Language Model for General Audio Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23161v1</link><description>Autoregressive (AR) large audio language models (LALMs) such as Qwen-2.5-Omni have achieved strong performance on audio understanding and interaction, but scaling them remains costly in data and computation, and strictly sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently been shown to make effective use of limited training data, and prior work on DIFFA indicates that replacing an AR backbone with a diffusion counterpart can substantially improve audio understanding under matched settings, albeit at a proof-of-concept scale without large-scale instruction tuning, preference alignment, or practical decoding schemes. We introduce DIFFA-2, a practical diffusion-based LALM for general audio understanding. DIFFA-2 upgrades the speech encoder, employs dual semantic and acoustic adapters, and is trained with a four-stage curriculum that combines semantic and acoustic alignment, large-scale supervised fine-tuning, and variance-reduced preference optimization, using only fully open-source corpora. Experiments on MMSU, MMAU, and MMAR show that DIFFA-2 consistently improves over DIFFA and is competitive to strong AR LALMs under practical training budgets, supporting diffusion-based modeling is a viable backbone for large-scale audio understanding.

Deployed language models almost never follow it, instead being exposed through a single API endpoint that serves all users and requests. This gap exists not because least privilege would be unhelpful; deployments would benefit greatly from reducing unnecessary capability exposure. The real obstacle is definitional and mechanistic: what does "access" mean inside a language model, and how can we enforce it without retraining or deploying multiple models? We take inspiration from least privilege in computer systems and define a class of models called least-privilege language models, where privilege is reachable internal computation during the forward pass. In this view, lowering privilege literally shrinks the model's accessible function class, as opposed to denying access via learned policies. We formalize deployment-time control as a monitor-allocator-enforcer stack, separating (i) request-time signals, (ii) a decision rule that allocates privilege, and (iii) an inference-time mechanism that selects privilege. We then propose Nested Least-Privilege Networks, a shape-preserving, rank-indexed intervention that provides a smooth, reversible control knob. We show that this knob yields policy-usable privilege-utility frontiers and enables selective suppression of targeted capabilities with limited collateral degradation across various policies.

We propose a method that segments unlabelled trajectories into skills and induces a hierarchical structure over them using a grammar-based approach. The resulting hierarchy captures both low-level behaviours and their composition into higher-level skills. We evaluate our approach in high-dimensional, pixel-based environments, including Craftax and the full, unmodified version of Minecraft. Using metrics for skill segmentation, reuse, and hierarchy quality, we find that our method consistently produces more structured and semantically meaningful hierarchies than existing baselines. Furthermore, as a proof of concept for utility, we demonstrate that these discovered hierarchies accelerate and stabilise learning on downstream reinforcement learning tasks.</description><author>Damion Harvey, Geraud Nangue Tasse, Branden Ingram, Benjamin Rosman, Steven James</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:41:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23156v1</guid></item><item><title>SPICE: Submodular Penalized Information-Conflict Selection for Efficient Large Language Model Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23155v1</link><description>Information-based data selection for instruction tuning is compelling: maximizing the log-determinant of the Fisher information yields a monotone submodular objective, enabling greedy algorithms to achieve a $(1-1/e)$ approximation under a cardinality budget. In practice, however, we identify alleviating gradient conflicts, misalignment between per-sample gradients, is a key factor that slows down the decay of marginal log-determinant information gains, thereby preventing significant loss of information. We formalize this via an $\varepsilon$-decomposition that quantifies the deviation from ideal submodularity as a function of conflict statistics, yielding data-dependent approximation factors that tighten as conflicts diminish. Guided by this analysis, we propose SPICE, a conflict-aware selector that maximizes information while penalizing misalignment, and that supports early stopping and proxy models for efficiency. Empirically, SPICE selects subsets with higher log-determinant information than original criteria, and these informational gains translate into performance improvements: across 8 benchmarks with LLaMA2-7B and Qwen2-7B, SPICE uses only 10% of the data, yet matches or exceeds 6 methods including full-data tuning. This achieves performance improvements with substantially lower training cost.</description><author>Powei Chang, Jinpeng Zhang, Bowen Chen, Chenyu Wang, Chenlu Guo, Yixing Zhang, Yukang Gao, JianXiang Xiang, Yue Gao, Chaoqun Sun, Yiyi Chen, Dongying Kong</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:40:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23155v1</guid></item><item><title>On Safer Reinforcement Learning Policies for Sedation and Analgesia in Intensive Care</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23154v1</link><description>Pain management in intensive care usually involves complex trade-offs between therapeutic goals and patient safety, since both inadequate and excessive treatment may induce serious sequelae. Reinforcement learning can help address this challenge by learning medication dosing policies from retrospective data. However, prior work on sedation and analgesia has optimized for objectives that do not value patient survival while relying on algorithms unsuitable for imperfect information settings. We investigated the risks of these design choices by implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability. Using data from 47,144 ICU stays in the MIMIC-IV database, we trained policies to prescribe opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine according to two goals: reduce pain or jointly reduce pain and mortality. We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated. This suggests that valuing long-term outcomes could be critical for safer treatment policies, even if a short-term goal remains the primary objective.</description><author>Joel Romero-Hernandez, Oscar Camara</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:40:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23154v1</guid></item><item><title>Open-Vocabulary Functional 3D Human-Scene Interaction Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20835v2</link><description>Generating 3D humans that functionally interact with 3D scenes remains an open problem with applications in embodied AI, robotics, and interactive content creation. The key challenge involves reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses required to achieve functionality-aware interaction. Unfortunately, existing methods typically lack explicit reasoning over object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, resulting in implausible or functionally incorrect interactions. In this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven framework that enables functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. Given a task prompt, FunHSI performs functionality-aware contact reasoning to identify functional scene elements, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and model high-level interactions via a contact graph. We then leverage vision-language models to synthesize a human performing the task in the image and estimate proposed 3D body and hand poses. Finally, the proposed 3D body configuration is refined via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness. In contrast to existing methods, FunHSI not only synthesizes more plausible general 3D interactions, such as "sitting on a sofa'', while supporting fine-grained functional human-scene interactions, e.g., "increasing the room temperature''. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI consistently generates functionally correct and physically plausible human-scene interactions across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.</description><author>Jie Liu, Yu Sun, Alpar Cseke, Yao Feng, Nicolas Heron, Michael J.

This trend has inspired practical and academic interest in model editing, that is, in adjusting the weights of the model to modify its likely outputs for queries relating to a specific fact or set of facts. This may be done either to amend a fact or set of facts, for instance, to fix a frequent error in the training data, or to suppress a fact or set of facts entirely, for instance, in case of dangerous knowledge. Multiple methods have been proposed to do such edits. However, at the same time, it has been shown that such model editing can be brittle and incomplete. Moreover the effectiveness of any model editing method necessarily depends on the data on which the model is trained, and, therefore, a good understanding of the interaction of the training data distribution and the way it is stored in the network is necessary and helpful to reliably perform model editing. However, working with large language models trained on real-world data does not allow us to understand this relationship or fully measure the effects of model editing. We therefore propose Behemoth, a fully synthetic data generation framework. To demonstrate the practical insights from the framework, we explore model editing in the context of simple tabular data, demonstrating surprising findings that, in some cases, echo real-world results, for instance, that in some cases restricting the update rank results in a more effective update. The code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/behemoth.git.</description><author>Eugenia Iofinova, Dan Alistarh</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:39:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23153v1</guid></item><item><title>Quantum latent distributions in deep generative models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19857v2</link><description>Many successful families of generative models leverage a low-dimensional latent distribution that is mapped to a data distribution. Though simple latent distributions are often used, the choice of distribution has a strong impact on model performance. Recent experiments have suggested that the probability distributions produced by quantum processors, which are typically highly correlated and classically intractable, can lead to improved performance on some datasets. However, when and why latent distributions produced by quantum processors can improve performance, and whether these improvements are connected to quantum properties of these distributions, are open questions that we investigate in this work. We show in theory that, under certain conditions, these "quantum latent distributions" enable generative models to produce data distributions that classical latent distributions cannot efficiently produce. We provide intuition as to the underlying mechanisms that could explain a performance advantage on real datasets. Based on this, we perform extensive benchmarking on a synthetic quantum dataset and the QM9 molecular dataset, using both simulated and real photonic quantum processors. We find that the statistics arising from quantum interference lead to improved generative performance compared to classical baselines, suggesting that quantum processors can play a role in expanding the capabilities of deep generative models.</description><author>Omar Bacarreza, Thorin Farnsworth, Alexander Makarovskiy, Hugo Wallner, Tessa Hicks, Santiago Sempere-Llagostera, John Price, Robert J.

Will the system break down if the weather or the clothing changes? Is it robust regarding gender and age? To answer these questions and more, we need controlled studies with images that differ in a single attribute, but real benchmarks cannot provide such pairs. We thus present STAGE, a GenAI data toolkit for auditing 3D human pose estimators. For STAGE, we develop the first GenAI image creator with accurate 3D pose control and propose a novel evaluation strategy to isolate and quantify the effects of single factors such as gender, ethnicity, age, clothing, location, and weather. Enabled by STAGE, we generate a series of benchmarks to audit, for the first time, the sensitivity of popular pose estimators towards such factors. Our results show that natural variations can severely degrade pose estimator performance, raising doubts about their readiness for open-world deployment. We aim to highlight these robustness issues and establish STAGE as a benchmark to quantify them.</description><author>Nikita Kister, István Sárándi, Jiayi Wang, Anna Khoreva, Gerard Pons-Moll</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:37:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16536v2</guid></item><item><title>Monocular pose estimation of articulated open surgery tools -- in the wild</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12138v3</link><description>This work presents a framework for monocular 6D pose estimation of surgical instruments in open surgery, addressing challenges such as object articulations, specularity, occlusions, and synthetic-to-real domain adaptation.

In this work, we develop a computationally cheap, mathematically justified, and highly flexible distributional modification for combating known pitfalls in equality-constrained generative models. We propose perturbing the data distribution in a constraint-aware way such that the new distribution has support matching the ambient space dimension while still implicitly incorporating underlying manifold geometry. Through theoretical analyses and empirical evidence on several representative tasks, we illustrate that our approach consistently enables data distribution recovery and stable sampling with both diffusion models and normalizing flows.</description><author>Katherine Keegan, Lars Ruthotto</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:34:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23151v1</guid></item><item><title>Compressed BC-LISTA via Low-Rank Convolutional Decomposition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23148v1</link><description>We study Sparse Signal Recovery (SSR) methods for multichannel imaging with compressed {forward and backward} operators that preserve reconstruction accuracy. We propose a Compressed Block-Convolutional (C-BC) measurement model based on a low-rank Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) decomposition that is analytically initialized from a low-rank factorization of physics-derived forward/backward operators in time delay-based measurements. We use Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) to select a compact set of basis filters from the analytic model and compute linear mixing coefficients to approximate the full model. We consider the Learned Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (LISTA) network as a representative example for which the C-BC-LISTA extension is presented. In simulated multichannel ultrasound imaging across multiple Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs), C-BC-LISTA requires substantially fewer parameters and smaller model size than other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while improving reconstruction accuracy. In ablations over OMP, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based, and random initializations, OMP-initialized structured compression performs best, yielding the most efficient training and the best performance.</description><author>Han Wang, Yhonatan Kvich, Eduardo Pérez, Florian Römer, Yonina C.

However, IoT systems are vulnerable to clock drift, time-synchronization manipulation, and timestamp discontinuities, such as the Year 2038 (Y2K38) Unix overflow, all of which disrupt temporal ordering. Conventional anomaly-detection models, which assume reliable timestamps, fail to capture temporal inconsistencies. This paper introduces STGAT (Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network), a framework that models both temporal distortion and inter-device consistency in energy IoT systems. STGAT combines drift-aware temporal embeddings and temporal self-attention to capture corrupted time evolution at individual devices, and uses graph attention to model spatial propagation of timing errors. A curvature-regularized latent representation geometrically separates normal clock evolution from anomalies caused by drift, synchronization offsets, and overflow events. Experimental results on energy IoT telemetry with controlled timing perturbations show that STGAT achieves 95.7% accuracy, outperforming recurrent, transformer, and graph-based baselines with significant improvements (d &gt; 1.8, p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, STGAT reduces detection delay by 26%, achieving a 2.3-time-step delay while maintaining stable performance under overflow, drift, and physical inconsistencies.</description><author>Saeid Jamshidi, Omar Abdul Wahab, Rolando Herrero, Foutse Khomh</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:33:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23147v1</guid></item><item><title>Model Agnostic Differentially Private Causal Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19589v3</link><description>Estimating causal effects from observational data is essential in fields such as medicine, economics and social sciences, where privacy concerns are paramount. We propose a general, model-agnostic framework for differentially private estimation of average treatment effects (ATE) that avoids strong structural assumptions on the data-generating process or the models used to estimate propensity scores and conditional outcomes. In contrast to prior work, which enforces differential privacy by directly privatizing these nuisance components, our approach decouples nuisance estimation from privacy protection. This separation allows the use of flexible, state-of-the-art black-box models, while differential privacy is achieved by perturbing only predictions and aggregation steps within a fold-splitting scheme with ensemble techniques. We instantiate the framework for three classical estimators -- the G-Formula, inverse propensity weighting (IPW), and augmented IPW (AIPW) -- and provide formal utility and privacy guarantees, together with privatized confidence intervals. Empirical results on synthetic and real data show that our methods maintain competitive performance under realistic privacy budgets.</description><author>Christian Janos Lebeda, Mathieu Even, Aurélien Bellet, Julie Josse</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:33:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19589v3</guid></item><item><title>THINKSAFE: Self-Generated Safety Alignment for Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23143v1</link><description>Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance by leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) on reasoning tasks to generate long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this over-optimization often prioritizes compliance, making models vulnerable to harmful prompts. To mitigate this safety degradation, recent approaches rely on external teacher distillation, yet this introduces a distributional discrepancy that degrades native reasoning. We propose ThinkSafe, a self-generated alignment framework that restores safety alignment without external teachers. Our key insight is that while compliance suppresses safety mechanisms, models often retain latent knowledge to identify harm. ThinkSafe unlocks this via lightweight refusal steering, guiding the model to generate in-distribution safety reasoning traces. Fine-tuning on these self-generated responses effectively realigns the model while minimizing distribution shift. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen3 show ThinkSafe significantly improves safety while preserving reasoning proficiency. Notably, it achieves superior safety and comparable reasoning to GRPO, with significantly reduced computational cost.

Evaluation capabilities that currently exist today are limited in that they often focus on simple metrics, end-to-end outcomes, and are dependent on the perspectives of humans. In order to match the increasing complexity of these many component systems, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason, probe, iterate, and understand the nuanced logic passing through these systems. In this paper, we present RAFFLES, an offline evaluation architecture that incorporates iterative reasoning. Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using a central Judge to systematically identify faults and a set of specialized Evaluators to assess the quality of the candidate faults as well as rationales of the Judge. We evaluated RAFFLES with several benchmarks - the Who&amp;When dataset to identify step-level faults in multi-agent systems and the ReasonEval datasets to diagnose step-level mathematical reasoning errors. RAFFLES outperforms strong baselines, achieving an accuracy of over 20% and 50% on the Who&amp;When Hand-Crafted and Algorithmically-Generated datasets, and over 80% on the ReasonEval datasets. These results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual review.</description><author>Chenyang Zhu, Spencer Hong, Jingyu Wu, Kushal Chawla, Charlotte Tang, Youbing Yin, Nathan Wolfe, Erin Babinsky, Daben Liu</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:25:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06822v3</guid></item><item><title>Why GRPO Needs Normalization: A Local-Curvature Perspective on Adaptive Gradients</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23135v1</link><description>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key driver of language model reasoning. Among RL algorithms, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is the de facto standard, avoiding the need for a critic by using per-prompt baselines and variance normalization. Yet why and when this normalization helps remains unclear. In this work, we provide an explanation through the lens of local curvature of the sequence-level policy gradient: standard deviation normalization implements an adaptive gradient. Theoretically, under mild conditions, GRPO enjoys a strictly improved convergence rate over unnormalized REINFORCE, with gains characterized by the average within-prompt reward standard deviation across prompts and iterations. Empirically, our analysis on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks reveals three distinct training phases governed by the interplay between feature orthogonality and reward variance: (I) an early acceleration phase where high variance and orthogonality favor adaptive scaling; (II) a relatively stable transition phase; and (III) a late-stage regime where the loss of orthogonality limits further gains. Together, these results provide a principled account of when std normalization helps in GRPO, and offer broader insights into the design of critic-free RL algorithms.</description><author>Cheng Ge, Caitlyn Heqi Yin, Hao Liang, Jiawei Zhang</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:23:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23135v1</guid></item></channel></rss>
