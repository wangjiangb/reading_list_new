This way, we obtain a much simplermethod, while retaining adequate performance. We expect the simplified solutionto be more widely and easily applicable. This expectation is based on thereduced complexity, as well as the fact that we choose hyperparameters based onsimple heuristics, that transfer to other datasets. We then re-arrange thexView2 dataset splits such that the test locations are not seen duringtraining, contrary to the competition setup. In this setting, we find that boththe complex and the simplified model fail to generalize to unseen locations.Analyzing the dataset indicates that this failure to generalize is not only amodel-based problem, but that the difficulty might also be influenced by theunequal class distributions between events.

However, their reliance on predefined andtrained object categories limits their applicability in open scenarios.Addressing this limitation, we introduce YOLO-World, an innovative approachthat enhances YOLO with open-vocabulary detection capabilities throughvision-language modeling and pre-training on large-scale datasets.Specifically, we propose a new Re-parameterizable Vision-Language PathAggregation Network (RepVL-PAN) and region-text contrastive loss to facilitatethe interaction between visual and linguistic information. Our method excels indetecting a wide range of objects in a zero-shot manner with high efficiency.On the challenging LVIS dataset, YOLO-World achieves 35.4 AP with 52.0 FPS onV100, which outperforms many state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracyand speed. Furthermore, the fine-tuned YOLO-World achieves remarkableperformance on several downstream tasks, including object detection andopen-vocabulary instance segmentation.</description><author>Tianheng Cheng, Lin Song, Yixiao Ge, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang, Ying Shan</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 18:59:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17270v1</guid></item><item><title>In-Context Language Learning: Architectures and Algorithms</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12973v2</link><description>Large-scale neural language models exhibit a remarkable capacity forin-context learning (ICL): they can infer novel functions from datasetsprovided as input. Most of our current understanding of when and how ICL arisescomes from LMs trained on extremely simple learning problems like linearregression and associative recall. There remains a significant gap betweenthese model problems and the "real" ICL exhibited by LMs trained on large textcorpora, which involves not just retrieval and function approximation butfree-form generation of language and other structured outputs. In this paper,we study ICL through the lens of a new family of model problems we term incontext language learning (ICLL). In ICLL, LMs are presented with a set ofstrings from a formal language, and must generate additional strings from thesame language. We focus on in-context learning of regular languages generatedby random finite automata. We evaluate a diverse set of neural sequence models(including several RNNs, Transformers, and state-space model variants) onregular ICLL tasks, aiming to answer three questions: (1) Which model classesare empirically capable of ICLL? (2) What algorithmic solutions do successfulmodels implement to perform ICLL? (3) What architectural changes can improveICLL in less performant models? We first show that Transformers significantlyoutperform neural sequence models with recurrent or convolutionalrepresentations on ICLL tasks. Next, we provide evidence that their ability todo so relies on specialized "n-gram heads" (higher-order variants of inductionheads) that compute input-conditional next-token distributions. Finally, weshow that hard-wiring these heads into neural models improves performance notjust on ICLL, but natural language modeling -- improving the perplexity of340M-parameter models by up to 1.14 points (6.7%) on the SlimPajama dataset.</description><author>Ekin Akyürek, Bailin Wang, Yoon Kim, Jacob Andreas</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 18:59:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12973v2</guid></item><item><title>Effect of Weight Quantization on Learning Models by Typical Case Analysis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17269v1</link><description>This paper examines the quantization methods used in large-scale dataanalysis models and their hyperparameter choices. The recent surge in dataanalysis scale has significantly increased computational resource requirements.To address this, quantizing model weights has become a prevalent practice indata analysis applications such as deep learning. Quantization is particularlyvital for deploying large models on devices with limited computationalresources. However, the selection of quantization hyperparameters, like thenumber of bits and value range for weight quantization, remains anunderexplored area. In this study, we employ the typical case analysis fromstatistical physics, specifically the replica method, to explore the impact ofhyperparameters on the quantization of simple learning models. Our analysisyields three key findings: (i) an unstable hyperparameter phase, known asreplica symmetry breaking, occurs with a small number of bits and a largequantization width; (ii) there is an optimal quantization width that minimizeserror; and (iii) quantization delays the onset of overparameterization, helpingto mitigate overfitting as indicated by the double descent phenomenon. We alsodiscover that non-uniform quantization can enhance stability. Additionally, wedevelop an approximate message-passing algorithm to validate our theoreticalresults.</description><author>Shuhei Kashiwamura, Ayaka Sakata, Masaaki Imaizumi</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 18:58:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17269v1</guid></item><item><title>Weaver: Foundation Models for Creative Writing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17268v1</link><description>This work introduces Weaver, our first family of large language models (LLMs)dedicated to content creation. Weaver is pre-trained on a carefully selectedcorpus that focuses on improving the writing capabilities of large languagemodels. We then fine-tune Weaver for creative and professional writing purposesand align it to the preference of professional writers using a suit of novelmethods for instruction data synthesis and LLM alignment, making it able toproduce more human-like texts and follow more diverse instructions for contentcreation. The Weaver family consists of models of Weaver Mini (1.8B), WeaverBase (6B), Weaver Pro (14B), and Weaver Ultra (34B) sizes, suitable fordifferent applications and can be dynamically dispatched by a routing agentaccording to query complexity to balance response quality and computation cost.Evaluation on a carefully curated benchmark for assessing the writingcapabilities of LLMs shows Weaver models of all sizes outperform generalistLLMs several times larger than them. Notably, our most-capable Weaver Ultramodel surpasses GPT-4, a state-of-the-art generalist LLM, on various writingscenarios, demonstrating the advantage of training specialized LLMs for writingpurposes. Moreover, Weaver natively supports retrieval-augmented generation(RAG) and function calling (tool usage). We present various use cases of theseabilities for improving AI-assisted writing systems, including integration ofexternal knowledge bases, tools, or APIs, and providing personalized writingassistance. Furthermore, we discuss and summarize a guideline and bestpractices for pre-training and fine-tuning domain-specific LLMs.</description><author>Tiannan Wang, Jiamin Chen, Qingrui Jia, Shuai Wang, Ruoyu Fang, Huilin Wang, Zhaowei Gao, Chunzhao Xie, Chuou Xu, Jihong Dai, Yibin Liu, Jialong Wu, Shengwei Ding, Long Li, Zhiwei Huang, Xinle Deng, Teng Yu, Gangan Ma, Han Xiao, Zixin Chen, Danjun Xiang, Yunxia Wang, Yuanyuan Zhu, Yi Xiao, Jing Wang, Yiru Wang, Siran Ding, Jiayang Huang, Jiayi Xu, Yilihamu Tayier, Zhenyu Hu, Yuan Gao, Chengfeng Zheng, Yueshu Ye, Yihang Li, Lei Wan, Xinyue Jiang, Yujie Wang, Siyu Cheng, Zhule Song, Xiangru Tang, Xiaohua Xu, Ningyu Zhang, Huajun Chen, Yuchen Eleanor Jiang, Wangchunshu Zhou</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 18:58:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17268v1</guid></item><item><title>ReacLLaMA: Merging chemical and textual information in chemical reactivity AI models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17267v1</link><description>Chemical reactivity models are developed to predict chemical reactionoutcomes in the form of classification (success/failure) or regression (productyield) tasks. The vast majority of the reported models are trained solely onchemical information such as reactants, products, reagents, and solvents, butnot on the details of a synthetic protocol. Herein incorporation of proceduraltext with the aim to augment the Graphormer reactivity model and improve itsaccuracy is presented. Two major approaches are used: training an adapterGraphormer model that is provided with a GPT-2-derived latent representation ofthe text procedure (ReacLLaMA-Adapter) and labeling an unlabeled part of adataset with the LLaMA 2 model followed by training the Graphormer on anextended dataset (Zero-Shot Labeling ReacLLaMA). Both methodologies enhance thediscernment of unpromising reactions, thereby providing more accurate modelswith improved specificity.</description><author>Aline Hartgers, Ramil Nugmanov, Kostiantyn Chernichenko, Joerg Kurt Wegner</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 18:57:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17267v1</guid></item><item><title>Proactive Detection of Voice Cloning with Localized Watermarking</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17264v1</link><description>In the rapidly evolving field of speech generative models, there is apressing need to ensure audio authenticity against the risks of voice cloning.We present AudioSeal, the first audio watermarking technique designedspecifically for localized detection of AI-generated speech.

While some defenses have been proposed, they focuson narrow threat models and fall short of a strong defense, which we positshould be effective, universal, and practical. To achieve this, we propose thefirst adversarial objective for defending LMs against jailbreaking attacks andan algorithm, robust prompt optimization (RPO), that uses gradient-based tokenoptimization to enforce harmless outputs. This results in an easily accessiblesuffix that significantly improves robustness to both jailbreaks seen duringoptimization and unknown, held-out jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rateon Starling-7B from 84% to 8.66% across 20 jailbreaks. In addition, we findthat RPO has a minor effect on normal LM use, is successful under adaptiveattacks, and can transfer to black-box models, reducing the success rate of thestrongest attack on GPT-4 from 92% to 6%.</description><author>Andy Zhou, Bo Li, Haohan Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 18:56:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17263v1</guid></item><item><title>War and Peace (WarAgent): Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Simulation of World Wars</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17227v2</link><description>Can we avoid wars at the crossroads of history? This question has beenpursued by individuals, scholars, policymakers, and organizations throughouthuman history. In this research, we attempt to answer the question based on therecent advances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models(LLMs). We propose \textbf{WarAgent}, an LLM-powered multi-agent AI system, tosimulate the participating countries, their decisions, and the consequences, inhistorical international conflicts, including the World War I (WWI), the WorldWar II (WWII), and the Warring States Period (WSP) in Ancient China. Byevaluating the simulation effectiveness, we examine the advancements andlimitations of cutting-edge AI systems' abilities in studying complexcollective human behaviors such as international conflicts under diversesettings. In these simulations, the emergent interactions among agents alsooffer a novel perspective for examining the triggers and conditions that leadto war. Our findings offer data-driven and AI-augmented insights that canredefine how we approach conflict resolution and peacekeeping strategies. Theimplications stretch beyond historical analysis, offering a blueprint for usingAI to understand human history and possibly prevent future internationalconflicts.

We propose a novel scale distillation approach to train ourSR model. Instead of directly training our SR model on the scale factor ofinterest, we start by training a teacher model on a smaller magnificationscale, thereby making the SR problem simpler for the teacher. We then train astudent model for a higher magnification scale, using the predictions of theteacher as a target during the training. This process is repeated iterativelyuntil we reach the target scale factor of the final model. The rationale behindour scale distillation is that the teacher aids the student diffusion modeltraining by i) providing a target adapted to the current noise level ratherthan using the same target coming from ground truth data for all noise levelsand ii) providing an accurate target as the teacher has a simpler task tosolve. We empirically show that the distilled model significantly outperformsthe model trained for high scales directly, specifically with few steps duringinference. Having a strong diffusion model that requires only one step allowsus to freeze the U-Net and fine-tune the decoder on top of it. We show that thecombination of spatially distilled U-Net and fine-tuned decoder outperformsstate-of-the-art methods requiring 200 steps with only one single step.</description><author>Mehdi Noroozi, Isma Hadji, Brais Martinez, Adrian Bulat, Georgios Tzimiropoulos</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 18:49:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17258v1</guid></item><item><title>Weak-to-Strong Jailbreaking on Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17256v1</link><description>Although significant efforts have been dedicated to aligning large languagemodels (LLMs), red-teaming reports suggest that these carefully aligned LLMscould still be jailbroken through adversarial prompts, tuning, or decoding.Upon examining the jailbreaking vulnerability of aligned LLMs, we observe thatthe decoding distributions of jailbroken and aligned models differ only in theinitial generations. This observation motivates us to propose theweak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, where adversaries can utilize smallerunsafe/aligned LLMs (e.g., 7B) to guide jailbreaking against significantlylarger aligned LLMs (e.g., 70B). To jailbreak, one only needs to additionallydecode two smaller LLMs once, which involves minimal computation and latencycompared to decoding the larger LLMs. The efficacy of this attack isdemonstrated through experiments conducted on five models from three differentorganizations. Our study reveals a previously unnoticed yet efficient way ofjailbreaking, exposing an urgent safety issue that needs to be considered whenaligning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protectagainst such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging.The code for replicating the method is available athttps://github.com/XuandongZhao/weak-to-strong</description><author>Xuandong Zhao, Xianjun Yang, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Lei Li, Yu-Xiang Wang, William Yang Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 18:48:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17256v1</guid></item><item><title>SLIC: A Learned Image Codec Using Structure and Color</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17246v1</link><description>We propose the structure and color based learned image codec (SLIC) in whichthe task of compression is split into that of luminance and chrominance.

However, LLMs inherently lacklong-term memory, making it a nontrivial, ad hoc, and inevitably biased task tofine-tune them on domain-specific literature and data. Here we introduce LLaMP,a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework of multipledata-aware reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that dynamically interact withcomputational and experimental data on Materials Project (MP). Withoutfine-tuning, LLaMP demonstrates an ability to comprehend and integrate variousmodalities of materials science concepts, fetch relevant data stores on thefly, process higher-order data (such as crystal structures and elastictensors), and summarize multi-step procedures for solid-state synthesis. Weshow that LLaMP effectively corrects errors in GPT-3.5's intrinsic knowledge,reducing a 5.21% MAPE on frequently-documented bandgaps and a significant1103.54% MAPE on formation energies -- errors that GPT-3.5 seems to derive frommixed data sources. Additionally, LLaMP substantially reduces the hallucinatedvolumetric strain in a diamond cubic silicon structure from 66.3% to 0. Theproposed framework offers an intuitive and nearly hallucination-free approachto exploring materials informatics and establishes a pathway for knowledgedistillation and fine-tuning other language models. We envision the frameworkas a valuable component for scientific hypotheses and a foundation for futureautonomous laboratories where multiple LLM agents communicate and cooperatewith robotics to drive material synthesis and chemical reactions withouthard-coded human logic and intervention.</description><author>Yuan Chiang, Chia-Hong Chou, Janosh Riebesell</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 18:37:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17244v1</guid></item><item><title>Enhancing Low-Order Discontinuous Galerkin Methods with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Compressible Navier--Stokes Equations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18897v2</link><description>The growing computing power over the years has enabled simulations to becomemore complex and accurate. While immensely valuable for scientific discoveryand problem-solving, however, high-fidelity simulations come with significantcomputational demands. As a result, it is common to run a low-fidelity modelwith a subgrid-scale model to reduce the computational cost, but selecting theappropriate subgrid-scale models and tuning them are challenging. We propose anovel method for learning the subgrid-scale model effects when simulatingpartial differential equations augmented by neural ordinary differentialoperators in the context of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) spatial discretization.Our approach learns the missing scales of the low-order DG solver at acontinuous level and hence improves the accuracy of the low-order DGapproximations as well as accelerates the filtered high-order DG simulationswith a certain degree of precision. We demonstrate the performance of ourapproach through multidimensional Taylor-Green vortex examples at differentReynolds numbers and times, which cover laminar, transitional, and turbulentregimes. The proposed method not only reconstructs the subgrid-scale from thelow-order (1st-order) approximation but also speeds up the filtered high-orderDG (6th-order) simulation by two orders of magnitude.</description><author>Shinhoo Kang, Emil M.

Here we tested whether larger open-sourcemodels such as those from the OPT and LLaMA families are better at predictingbrain responses recorded using fMRI. Mirroring scaling results from othercontexts, we found that brain prediction performance scales logarithmicallywith model size from 125M to 30B parameter models, with ~15% increased encodingperformance as measured by correlation with a held-out test set across 3subjects. Similar logarithmic behavior was observed when scaling the size ofthe fMRI training set. We also characterized scaling for acoustic encodingmodels that use HuBERT, WavLM, and Whisper, and we found comparableimprovements with model size. A noise ceiling analysis of these large,high-performance encoding models showed that performance is nearing thetheoretical maximum for brain areas such as the precuneus and higher auditorycortex. These results suggest that increasing scale in both models and datawill yield incredibly effective models of language processing in the brain,enabling better scientific understanding as well as applications such asdecoding.</description><author>Richard Antonello, Aditya Vaidya, Alexander G.

However, LLMs are sensitive to the choice of prompts, and therefore acrucial research question is how to select good demonstrations for ICL. Oneeffective strategy is leveraging semantic similarity between the ICLdemonstrations and test inputs by using a text retriever, which however issub-optimal as that does not consider the LLM's existing knowledge about thattask. From prior work (Lyu et al., 2023), we already know that labels pairedwith the demonstrations bias the model predictions. This leads us to ourhypothesis whether considering LLM's existing knowledge about the task,especially with respect to the output label space can help in a betterdemonstration selection strategy. Through extensive experimentation on threetext classification tasks, we find that it is beneficial to not only choosesemantically similar ICL demonstrations but also to choose those demonstrationsthat help resolve the inherent label ambiguity surrounding the test example.Interestingly, we find that including demonstrations that the LLM previouslymis-classified and also fall on the test example's decision boundary, bringsthe most performance gain.</description><author>Lingyu Gao, Aditi Chaudhary, Krishna Srinivasan, Kazuma Hashimoto, Karthik Raman, Michael Bendersky</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 18:26:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07900v2</guid></item><item><title>Asynchronous Distributed Genetic Algorithms with Javascript and JSON</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17234v1</link><description>In a connected world, spare CPU cycles are up for grabs, if you only make itsobtention easy enough.

Recent studies have highlighted thepotential of using neural data to mimic brain processing; however, these oftenreply on invasive neural recordings from non-human subjects, leaving a criticalgap in our understanding of human visual perception and the development of morehuman brain-like vision models. Addressing this gap, we present, for the firsttime, "Re(presentational)Al(ignment)net", a vision model aligned with humanbrain activity based on non-invasive EEG recordings, demonstrating asignificantly higher similarity to human brain representations.

However, existing worksoften treat morality as binary, ranging from right to wrong. This simplisticview does not capture the nuances of moral judgment. Pluralist moralphilosophers argue that human morality can be deconstructed into a finitenumber of elements, respecting individual differences in moral judgment. Inline with this view, we build a pluralist moral sentence embedding space via astate-of-the-art contrastive learning approach. We systematically investigatethe embedding space by studying the emergence of relationships among moralelements, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our results show that apluralist approach to morality can be captured in an embedding space. However,moral pluralism is challenging to deduce via self-supervision alone andrequires a supervised approach with human labels.</description><author>Jeongwoo Park, Enrico Liscio, Pradeep K.

Our target is to gain someinsights on the effects caused by communication when the algorithm scales. Tothis end, we consider a set of basic topologies in order to avoid theoverlapping of algorithmic effects between communication and topologicalstructures. We analyse the approach viability by comparing how solution qualityand algorithm speed change when the number of processors increases and compareit with an Island model based implementation. A finer-grained approach impliesa better chance of achieving a larger scalable system; such a feature iscrucial concerning large-scale parallel architectures such as Peer-to-Peersystems. In order to check scalability, we perform a threefold experimentalevaluation of this model: First, we concentrate on the algorithmic results whenthe problem scales up to eight nodes in comparison with how it does followingthe Island model. Second, we analyse the computing time speedup of the approachwhile scaling. Finally, we analyse the network performance with the proposedself-adaptive migration rate policy that depends on the link latency andbandwidth. With this experimental setup, our approach shows better scalabilitythan the Island model and a equivalent robustness on the average of the threetest functions under study.</description><author>Juan Luis Jiménez Laredo, Pedro A.

These issues can limit the model's effectiveness in accuratelyinterpreting complex visual information and over-lengthy contextualinformation. Addressing these challenges is crucial for enhancing theperformance and applicability of VLMs. This paper proposes the use of ensembleexperts technique to synergizes the capabilities of individual visual encoders,including those skilled in image-text matching, OCR, image segmentation, etc.This technique introduces a fusion network to unify the processing of outputsfrom different visual experts, while bridging the gap between image encodersand pre-trained LLMs. In addition, we explore different positional encodingschemes to alleviate the waste of positional encoding caused by lengthy imagefeature sequences, effectively addressing the issue of position overflow andlength limitations. For instance, in our implementation, this techniquesignificantly reduces the positional occupancy in models like SAM, from asubstantial 4096 to a more efficient and manageable 64 or even down to 1.Experimental results demonstrate that VLMs with multiple experts exhibitconsistently superior performance over isolated visual encoders and mark asignificant performance boost as more experts are integrated.

In recent years, this problem has seenremarkable progress with the advent of deep learning-based local image featuresand learnable matchers. Still, learnable matchers often underperform when thereexists only small regions of co-visibility between image pairs (i.e. widecamera baselines). To address this problem, we leverage recent progress incoarse single-view geometry estimation methods. We propose LFM-3D, a LearnableFeature Matching framework that uses models based on graph neural networks andenhances their capabilities by integrating noisy, estimated 3D signals to boostcorrespondence estimation. When integrating 3D signals into the matcher model,we show that a suitable positional encoding is critical to effectively make useof the low-dimensional 3D information. We experiment with two different 3Dsignals - normalized object coordinates and monocular depth estimates - andevaluate our method on large-scale (synthetic and real) datasets containingobject-centric image pairs across wide baselines. We observe strong featurematching improvements compared to 2D-only methods, with up to +6% total recalland +28% precision at fixed recall.

In theseapplications, strong dependencies often exist among the variables (e.g., stockreturns), which can undermine the FDR control property of existing methods likethe model-X knockoff method or the T-Rex selector. To address this issue, wehave expanded the T-Rex framework to accommodate overlapping groups of highlycorrelated variables. This is achieved by integrating a nearest neighborspenalization mechanism into the framework, which provably controls the FDR atthe user-defined target level.

However, these methodsoften fail to reliably control the FDR in the presence of highly dependentvariable groups, a common characteristic in fields such as genomics andfinance. To tackle this critical issue, we introduce a novel framework thataccounts for general dependency structures. Our proposed dependency-aware T-Rexselector integrates hierarchical graphical models within the T-Rex framework toeffectively harness the dependency structure among variables. Leveragingmartingale theory, we prove that our variable penalization mechanism ensuresFDR control. We further generalize the FDR-controlling framework by stating andproving a clear condition necessary for designing both graphical andnon-graphical models that capture dependencies. Additionally, we formulate afully integrated optimal calibration algorithm that concurrently determines theparameters of the graphical model and the T-Rex framework, such that the FDR iscontrolled while maximizing the number of selected variables. Numericalexperiments and a breast cancer survival analysis use-case demonstrate that theproposed method is the only one among the state-of-the-art benchmark methodsthat controls the FDR and reliably detects genes that have been previouslyidentified to be related to breast cancer.

Three-dimensional polarized light imaging (3D-PLI) is amicroscopic imaging technique that enables insights into the fine-grainedorganization of myelinated nerve fibers with high resolution. Descriptorscharacterizing the fiber architecture observed in 3D-PLI would enabledownstream analysis tasks such as multimodal correlation studies, clustering,and mapping. However, best practices for observer-independent characterizationof fiber architecture in 3D-PLI are not yet available. To this end, we proposethe application of a fully data-driven approach to characterize nerve fiberarchitecture in 3D-PLI images using self-supervised representation learning. Weintroduce a 3D-Context Contrastive Learning (CL-3D) objective that utilizes thespatial neighborhood of texture examples across histological brain sections ofa 3D reconstructed volume to sample positive pairs for contrastive learning. Wecombine this sampling strategy with specifically designed image augmentationsto gain robustness to typical variations in 3D-PLI parameter maps. The approachis demonstrated for the 3D reconstructed occipital lobe of a vervet monkeybrain. We show that extracted features are highly sensitive to differentconfigurations of nerve fibers, yet robust to variations between consecutivebrain sections arising from histological processing. We demonstrate theirpractical applicability for retrieving clusters of homogeneous fiberarchitecture and performing data mining for interactively selected templates ofspecific components of fiber architecture such as U-fibers.</description><author>Alexander Oberstrass, Sascha E.

Existing POL heavily rely on strictannotation rules, which are difficult to define and apply, to handle theproblem. In this study, we propose coarse point refinement (CPR), which to ourbest knowledge is the first attempt to alleviate semantic variance from analgorithmic perspective. CPR reduces the semantic variance by selecting asemantic centre point in a neighbourhood region to replace the initialannotated point. Furthermore, We design a sampling region estimation module todynamically compute a sampling region for each object and use a cascadedstructure to achieve end-to-end optimization. We further integrate a varianceregularization into the structure to concentrate the predicted scores, yieldingCPR++. We observe that CPR++ can obtain scale information and further reducethe semantic variance in a global region, thus guaranteeing high-performanceobject localization.

To this end, there is anincreasing interest in developing multilingual VL models via a joint-learningsetup, which, however, could be unrealistic due to expensive costs and dataavailability. In this work, we propose to extend VL-PTMs' language capacity bycontinual language learning (CLL), where a model needs to update its linguisticknowledge incrementally without suffering from catastrophic forgetting (CF). Webegin our study by introducing a model dubbed CLL-CLIP, which builds upon CLIP,a prevailing VL-PTM that has acquired image-English text alignment.Specifically, CLL-CLIP contains an expandable token embedding layer to handlelinguistic differences. It solely trains token embeddings to improve memorystability and is optimized under cross-modal and cross-lingual objectives tolearn the alignment between images and multilingual texts. To alleviate CFraised by covariate shift and lexical overlap, we further propose a novelapproach that ensures the identical distribution of all token embeddings duringinitialization and regularizes token embedding learning during training. Weconstruct a CLL benchmark covering 36 languages based on MSCOCO and XM3600datasets and then evaluate multilingual image-text retrieval performance.Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of CLL-CLIP and show that ourapproach can boost CLL-CLIP, e.g., by 6.7% in text-to-image average Recall@1 onXM3600, and improve various state-of-the-art methods consistently.

We are particularly interested to see whether pretrained ARmodels can be transformed into text diffusion models through a lightweightadaptation procedure we call ``AR2Diff''. We begin by establishing a strongbaseline setup for training text diffusion models. Comparing across multiplearchitectures and pretraining objectives, we find that training a decoder-onlymodel with a prefix LM objective is best or near-best across several tasks.Building on this finding, we test various transfer learning setups for textdiffusion models. On machine translation, we find that text diffusionunderperforms the standard AR approach. However, on code synthesis andextractive QA, we find diffusion models trained from scratch outperform ARmodels in many cases. We also observe quality gains from AR2Diff -- adapting ARmodels to use diffusion decoding. These results are promising given that textdiffusion is relatively underexplored and can be significantly faster than ARdecoding for long text generation.</description><author>Kehang Han, Kathleen Kenealy, Aditya Barua, Noah Fiedel, Noah Constant</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 17:11:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17181v1</guid></item><item><title>GraphViz2Vec: A Structure-aware Feature Generation Model to Improve Classification in GNNs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17178v1</link><description>GNNs are widely used to solve various tasks including node classification andlink prediction. Most of the GNN architectures assume the initial embedding tobe random or generated from popular distributions. These initial embeddingsrequire multiple layers of transformation to converge into a meaningful latentrepresentation. While number of layers allow accumulation of largerneighbourhood of a node it also introduce the problem of over-smoothing. Inaddition, GNNs are inept at representing structural information. For example,the output embedding of a node does not capture its triangles participation. Inthis paper, we presented a novel feature extraction methodology GraphViz2Vecthat can capture the structural information of a node's local neighbourhood tocreate meaningful initial embeddings for a GNN model. These initial embeddingshelps existing models achieve state-of-the-art results in variousclassification tasks. Further, these initial embeddings help the model toproduce desired results with only two layers which in turn reduce the problemof over-smoothing. The initial encoding of a node is obtained from an imageclassification model trained on multiple energy diagrams of its localneighbourhood. These energy diagrams are generated with the induced sub-graphof the nodes traversed by multiple random walks. The generated encodingsincrease the performance of existing models on classification tasks (with amean increase of $4.65\%$ and $2.58\%$ for the node and link classificationtasks, respectively), with some models achieving state-of-the-art results.</description><author>Shraban Kumar Chatterjee, Suman Kundu</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 17:11:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17178v1</guid></item><item><title>Data-Driven Discovery of PDEs via the Adjoint Method</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17177v1</link><description>In this work, we present an adjoint-based method for discovering theunderlying governing partial differential equations (PDEs) given data. The ideais to consider a parameterized PDE in a general form, and formulate theoptimization problem that minimizes the error of PDE solution from data. Usingvariational calculus, we obtain an evolution equation for the Lagrangemultipliers (adjoint equations) allowing us to compute the gradient of theobjective function with respect to the parameters of PDEs given data in astraightforward manner. In particular, for a family of parameterized andnonlinear PDEs, we show how the corresponding adjoint equations can be derived.Here, we show that given smooth data set, the proposed adjoint method canrecover the true PDE up to machine accuracy. However, in the presence of noise,the accuracy of the adjoint method becomes comparable to the famous PDEFunctional Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics method known as PDE-FIND (Rudyet al., 2017). Even though the presented adjoint method relies onforward/backward solvers, it outperforms PDE-FIND for large data sets thanks tothe analytic expressions for gradients of the cost function with respect toeach PDE parameter.</description><author>Mohsen Sadr, Tony Tohme, Kamal Youcef-Toumi</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 17:10:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17177v1</guid></item><item><title>A large dataset curation and benchmark for drug target interaction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17174v1</link><description>Bioactivity data plays a key role in drug discovery and repurposing.

The difficulty lies in finding a good representation forthe current task so that the agent understands how it relates to previouslyseen tasks. To achieve zero-shot transfer, we introduce the function encoder, arepresentation learning algorithm which represents a function as a weightedcombination of learned, non-linear basis functions. By using a function encoderto represent the reward function or the transition function, the agent hasinformation on how the current task relates to previously seen tasks via acoherent vector representation. Thus, the agent is able to achieve transferbetween related tasks at run time with no additional training.

Finding the analytical form ofGreen's function is a non-trivial exercise, especially for a PDE defined on acomplex domain or a PDE with variable coefficients. In this paper, we propose anovel boundary integral network to learn the domain-independent Green'sfunction, referred to as BIN-G. We evaluate the Green's function in the BIN-Gusing a radial basis function (RBF) kernel-based neural network. We train theBIN-G by minimizing the residual of the PDE and the mean squared errors of thesolutions to the boundary integral equations for prescribed test functions. Byleveraging the symmetry of the Green's function and controlling refinements ofthe RBF kernel near the singularity of the Green function, we demonstrate thatour numerical scheme enables fast training and accurate evaluation of theGreen's function for PDEs with variable coefficients. The learned Green'sfunction is independent of the domain geometries, forcing terms, and boundaryconditions in the boundary integral formulation. Numerical experiments verifythe desired properties of the method and the expected accuracy for thetwo-dimensional Poisson and Helmholtz equations with variable coefficients.</description><author>Pawan Negi, Maggie Cheng, Mahesh Krishnamurthy, Wenjun Ying, Shuwang Li</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 17:00:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17172v1</guid></item><item><title>Conditional and Modal Reasoning in Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17169v1</link><description>The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) are the topic of agrowing body of research in artificial intelligence and cognitive science.

We focus oninference patterns involving conditionals (e.g., 'If Ann has a queen, then Bobhas a jack') and epistemic modals (e.g., 'Ann might have an ace', 'Bob musthave a king'). These inference patterns have been of special interest tologicians, philosophers, and linguists, since they plausibly play a centralrole in human reasoning.

A key feature of UltraTool is its independent evaluation ofplanning with natural language, which happens before tool usage and simplifiesthe task solving by mapping out the intermediate steps. Thus, unlike previouswork, it eliminates the restriction of pre-defined toolset during planning.Through extensive experiments on various LLMs, we offer novel insights into theevaluation of capabilities of LLMs in tool utilization, thereby contributing afresh perspective to this rapidly evolving field.

However, this approach ofstrategy customization presents a significant challenge: handcrafting anoptimized strategy for a class of SMT instances remains a complex and demandingtask for both solver developers and users alike. In this paper, we address this problem of automatic SMT strategy synthesisvia a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based method. Our method treatsstrategy synthesis as a sequential decision-making process, whose search treecorresponds to the strategy space, and employs MCTS to navigate this vastsearch space. The key innovations that enable our method to identify effectivestrategies, while keeping costs low, are the ideas of layered and staged MCTSsearch. These novel approaches allow for a deeper and more efficientexploration of the strategy space, enabling us to synthesize more effectivestrategies than the default ones in state-of-the-art (SOTA) SMT solvers. Weimplement our method, dubbed Z3alpha, as part of the Z3 SMT solver. Throughextensive evaluations across 6 important SMT logics, Z3alpha demonstratessuperior performance compared to the SOTA synthesis tool FastSMT, the defaultZ3 solver, and the CVC5 solver on most benchmarks.

However, existing video generation models are typically trained on alimited number of frames, resulting in the inability to generate high-fidelitylong videos during inference. Furthermore, these models only supportsingle-text conditions, whereas real-life scenarios often require multi-textconditions as the video content changes over time. To tackle these challenges,this study explores the potential of extending the text-driven capability togenerate longer videos conditioned on multiple texts. 1) We first analyze theimpact of initial noise in video diffusion models. Then building upon theobservation of noise, we propose FreeNoise, a tuning-free and time-efficientparadigm to enhance the generative capabilities of pretrained video diffusionmodels while preserving content consistency. Specifically, instead ofinitializing noises for all frames, we reschedule a sequence of noises forlong-range correlation and perform temporal attention over them by window-basedfunction. 2) Additionally, we design a novel motion injection method to supportthe generation of videos conditioned on multiple text prompts. Extensiveexperiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending thegenerative capabilities of video diffusion models. It is noteworthy thatcompared with the previous best-performing method which brought about 255%extra time cost, our method incurs only negligible time cost of approximately17%.

However, suchcross-silo collaborations between platforms are restricted by increasinglystringent privacy protection regulations, thus data cannot be aggregated fortraining. Federated learning (FL) is a practical solution to deal with the datasilo problem in recommendation scenarios. Existing cross-silo FL methodstransmit model information to collaboratively build a global model byleveraging the data of overlapped users. However, in reality, the number ofoverlapped users is often very small, thus largely limiting the performance ofsuch approaches. Moreover, transmitting model information during trainingrequires high communication costs and may cause serious privacy leakage. Inthis paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving double distillation frameworknamed FedPDD for cross-silo federated recommendation, which efficientlytransfers knowledge when overlapped users are limited. Specifically, our doubledistillation strategy enables local models to learn not only explicit knowledgefrom the other party but also implicit knowledge from its past predictions.Moreover, to ensure privacy and high efficiency, we employ an offline trainingscheme to reduce communication needs and privacy leakage risk. In addition, weadopt differential privacy to further protect the transmitted information. Theexperiments on two real-world recommendation datasets, HetRec-MovieLens andCriteo, demonstrate the effectiveness of FedPDD compared to thestate-of-the-art approaches.</description><author>Sheng Wan, Dashan Gao, Hanlin Gu, Daning Hu</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 16:32:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06272v2</guid></item><item><title>An Open Software Suite for Event-Based Video</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17151v1</link><description>While traditional video representations are organized around discrete imageframes, event-based video is a new paradigm that forgoes image framesaltogether.

However, it remains a difficulttask to interpret control policies learned by the agent. Difficulties mainlycome from two aspects: 1) agents in imitation learning are usually implementedas deep neural networks, which are black-box models and lack interpretability;2) the latent causal mechanism behind agents' decisions may vary along thetrajectory, rather than staying static throughout time steps. To increasetransparency and offer better interpretability of the neural agent, we proposeto expose its captured knowledge in the form of a directed acyclic causalgraph, with nodes being action and state variables and edges denoting thecausal relations behind predictions. Furthermore, we design this causaldiscovery process to be state-dependent, enabling it to model the dynamics inlatent causal graphs. Concretely, we conduct causal discovery from theperspective of Granger causality and propose a self-explainable imitationlearning framework, {\method}. The proposed framework is composed of threeparts: a dynamic causal discovery module, a causality encoding module, and aprediction module, and is trained in an end-to-end manner. After the model islearned, we can obtain causal relations among states and action variablesbehind its decisions, exposing policies learned by it. Experimental results onboth synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of theproposed {\method} in learning the dynamic causal graphs for understanding thedecision-making of imitation learning meanwhile maintaining high predictionaccuracy.</description><author>Tianxiang Zhao, Wenchao Yu, Suhang Wang, Lu Wang, Xiang Zhang, Yuncong Chen, Yanchi Liu, Wei Cheng, Haifeng Chen</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 16:31:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00489v4</guid></item><item><title>SSLRec: A Self-Supervised Learning Framework for Recommendation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05697v3</link><description>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained significant interest in recentyears as a solution to address the challenges posed by sparse and noisy data inrecommender systems.

SongBsAb features a dual prevention effect by causing both (singer)identity disruption and lyric disruption, namely, the SVC-covered singing voiceneither imitates the target singer nor preserves the original lyrics. Toimprove the imperceptibility of perturbations, we refine a psychoacousticmodel-based loss with the backing track as an additional masker, a uniqueaccompanying element for singing voices compared to ordinary speech voices. Toenhance the transferability, we propose to utilize a frame-level interactionreduction-based loss. We demonstrate the prevention effectiveness, utility, androbustness of SongBsAb on three SVC models and two datasets using bothobjective and human study-based subjective metrics. Our work fosters anemerging research direction for mitigating illegal automated song covers.</description><author>Guangke Chen, Yedi Zhang, Fu Song, Ting Wang, Xiaoning Du, Yang Liu</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 16:07:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17133v1</guid></item><item><title>Dual Relation Alignment for Composed Image Retrieval</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02169v2</link><description>Composed image retrieval, a task involving the search for a target imageusing a reference image and a complementary text as the query, has witnessedsignificant advancements owing to the progress made in cross-modal modeling.Unlike the general image-text retrieval problem with only one alignmentrelation, i.e., image-text, we argue for the existence of two types ofrelations in composed image retrieval. The explicit relation pertains to thereference image &amp; complementary text-target image, which is commonly exploitedby existing methods. Besides this intuitive relation, the observations duringour practice have uncovered another implicit yet crucial relation, i.e.,reference image &amp; target image-complementary text, since we found that thecomplementary text can be inferred by studying the relation between the targetimage and the reference image. Regrettably, existing methods largely focus onleveraging the explicit relation to learn their networks, while overlooking theimplicit relation. In response to this weakness, We propose a new framework forcomposed image retrieval, termed dual relation alignment, which integrates bothexplicit and implicit relations to fully exploit the correlations among thetriplets. Specifically, we design a vision compositor to fuse reference imageand target image at first, then the resulted representation will serve tworoles: (1) counterpart for semantic alignment with the complementary text and(2) compensation for the complementary text to boost the explicit relationmodeling, thereby implant the implicit relation into the alignment learning.Our method is evaluated on two popular datasets, CIRR and FashionIQ, throughextensive experiments. The results confirm the effectiveness of ourdual-relation learning in substantially enhancing composed image retrievalperformance.</description><author>Xintong Jiang, Yaxiong Wang, Yujiao Wu, Meng Wang, Xueming Qian</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 16:02:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02169v2</guid></item><item><title>Personalized Differential Privacy for Ridge Regression</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17127v1</link><description>The increased application of machine learning (ML) in sensitive domainsrequires protecting the training data through privacy frameworks, such asdifferential privacy (DP). DP requires to specify a uniform privacy level$\varepsilon$ that expresses the maximum privacy loss that each data point inthe entire dataset is willing to tolerate. Yet, in practice, different datapoints often have different privacy requirements. Having to set one uniformprivacy level is usually too restrictive, often forcing a learner to guaranteethe stringent privacy requirement, at a large cost to accuracy. To overcomethis limitation, we introduce our novel Personalized-DP Output Perturbationmethod (PDP-OP) that enables to train Ridge regression models with individualper data point privacy levels. We provide rigorous privacy proofs for ourPDP-OP as well as accuracy guarantees for the resulting model. This work is thefirst to provide such theoretical accuracy guarantees when it comes topersonalized DP in machine learning, whereas previous work only providedempirical evaluations. We empirically evaluate PDP-OP on synthetic and realdatasets and with diverse privacy distributions. We show that by enabling eachdata point to specify their own privacy requirement, we can significantlyimprove the privacy-accuracy trade-offs in DP. We also show that PDP-OPoutperforms the personalized privacy techniques of Jorgensen et al.

However, we have discovered that data conflicts areinevitable when mixing instruction data from distinct domains, which can resultin performance drops for tasks of a specific domain. To address this issue, wepropose to apply an efficient Mixture of Experts (MoE) design, which is asparse Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE) for instruction finetuning MLLMs. Withinthe Transformer layers, we extend the popular Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) methodby creating a set of LoRA experts specifically for the MLP layer, and routeeach token to the top-1 expert based on a routing function, allowing adaptivechoices for tokens from different domains. Since the LoRA experts are sparselyactivated, the training and inference cost are kept roughly constant comparedto the original LoRA method. By replacing the plain-LoRA of LLaVA-1.5 with ourMoE design, our final model is named LLaVA-MoLE. Extensive experiments provedthat LLaVA-MoLE effectively mitigates the data conflict issue when mixingmultiple distinct instruction datasets with various configurations, andachieves consistent performance gains over the strong plain-LoRA baselines.Most importantly, on the mixed datasets, LLaVA-MoLE can even outperform theplain-LoRA baseline trained with twice the samples.</description><author>Shaoxiang Chen, Zequn Jie, Lin Ma</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 15:44:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16160v2</guid></item><item><title>Blind Audio Bandwidth Extension: A Diffusion-Based Zero-Shot Approach</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01433v2</link><description>Audio bandwidth extension involves the realistic reconstruction ofhigh-frequency spectra from bandlimited observations. In cases where thelowpass degradation is unknown, such as in restoring historical audiorecordings, this becomes a blind problem. This paper introduces a novel methodcalled BABE (Blind Audio Bandwidth Extension) that addresses the blind problemin a zero-shot setting, leveraging the generative priors of a pre-trainedunconditional diffusion model. During the inference process, BABE utilizes ageneralized version of diffusion posterior sampling, where the degradationoperator is unknown but parametrized and inferred iteratively. The performanceof the proposed method is evaluated using objective and subjective metrics, andthe results show that BABE surpasses state-of-the-art blind bandwidth extensionbaselines and achieves competitive performance compared to informed methodswhen tested with synthetic data. Moreover, BABE exhibits robust generalizationcapabilities when enhancing real historical recordings, effectivelyreconstructing the missing high-frequency content while maintaining coherencewith the original recording.

Materials and Methods: We trained our deep learning method, H-synEx, withsynthetic images derived from label maps built from ultra-high resolution exvivo MRI scans, which enables finer-grained manual segmentation when comparedwith 1mm isometric in vivo images. We validated this retrospective study using1535 in vivo images from six datasets and six MRI sequences. The quantitativeevaluation used the Dice Coefficient (DC) and Average Hausdorff distance (AVD).Statistical analysis compared hypothalamic subregion volumes in controls,Alzheimer's disease (AD), and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia(bvFTD) subjects using the area under the curve (AUC) and Wilcoxon rank sumtest. Results: H-SynEx can segment the hypothalamus across various MRI sequences,encompassing FLAIR sequences with significant slice spacing (5mm). Usinghypothalamic volumes on T1w images to distinguish control from AD and bvFTDpatients, we observed AUC values of 0.74 and 0.79 respectively. Additionally,AUC=0.66 was found for volume variation on FLAIR scans when comparing controland non-patients. Conclusion: Our results show that H-SynEx successfully leverages informationfrom ultra-high resolution scans to segment in vivo from different MRIsequences such as T1w, T2w, PD, qT1, FA, and FLAIR. We also found that ourautomated segmentation was able to discriminate controls versus patients onFLAIR images with 5mm spacing.

Thisapproach has two limitations: i) the scores lack interpretability, and humanannotators struggle with giving consistent scores; ii) most scoring methods arebased on (reference, translation) pairs, limiting their applicability inreal-world scenarios where references are absent. In practice, we often careabout whether a new MT system is better or worse than some competitors. Inaddition, reference-free MT evaluation is increasingly practical and necessary.Unfortunately, these two practical considerations have yet to be jointlyexplored. In this work, we formulate the reference-free MT evaluation into apairwise ranking problem. Given the source sentence and a pair of translations,our system predicts which translation is better. In addition to proposing thisnew formulation, we further show that this new paradigm can demonstratesuperior correlation with human judgments by merely using indirect supervisionfrom natural language inference and weak supervision from our synthetic data.In the context of reference-free evaluation, MT-Ranker, trained without anyhuman annotations, achieves state-of-the-art results on the WMT Shared MetricsTask benchmarks DARR20, MQM20, and MQM21.

This problem is critical in transportation planning applicationswhere the sensor coverage is low and the planned interventions havenetwork-wide impacts. The proposed model, named the Macroscopic TrafficEstimator (MaTE), can perform network-wide estimations of traffic flow andtravel time only using the set of observed measurements of these quantities.Because MaTE is grounded in macroscopic flow theory, all parameters andvariables are interpretable. The estimated traffic flow satisfies fundamentalflow conservation constraints and exhibits an increasing monotonic relationshipwith the estimated travel time. Using logit-based stochastic traffic assignmentas the principle for routing flow behavior makes the model fully differentiablewith respect to the model parameters. This property facilitates the applicationof computational graphs to learn parameters from vast amounts of spatiotemporaldata. We also integrate neural networks and polynomial kernel functions tocapture link flow interactions and enrich the mapping of traffic flows intotravel times. MaTE also adds a destination choice model and a trip generationmodel that uses historical data on the number of trips generated by location.Experiments on synthetic data show that the model can accurately estimatetravel time and traffic flow in out-of-sample links. Results obtained usingreal-world multi-source data from a large-scale transportation network suggestthat MaTE outperforms data-driven benchmarks, especially in travel timeestimation. The estimated parameters of MaTE are also informative about thehourly change in travel demand and supply characteristics of the transportationnetwork.</description><author>Pablo Guarda, Sean Qian</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 15:21:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17095v1</guid></item><item><title>StrokeNUWA: Tokenizing Strokes for Vector Graphic Synthesis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17093v1</link><description>To leverage LLMs for visual synthesis, traditional methods convert rasterimage information into discrete grid tokens through specialized visual modules,while disrupting the model's ability to capture the true semanticrepresentation of visual scenes.

Mostexisting data generation methods face challenges to ensure the temporalconsistency of the dynamic information for action. In addition, the datagenerated by these methods lack diversity when only a few training samples areavailable. To solve those problems, We propose a novel active generativenetwork (AGN), which can adaptively learn various action categories by motionstyle transfer to generate new actions when the data for a particular action isonly a single sample or few samples. The AGN consists of an action generationnetwork and an uncertainty metric network. The former, with ST-GCN as theBackbone, can implicitly learn the morphological features of the target actionwhile preserving the category features of the source action. The latter guidesgenerating actions. Specifically, an action recognition model generatesprediction vectors for each action, which is then scored using an uncertaintymetric. Finally, UMN provides the uncertainty sampling basis for the generatedactions.</description><author>Long Liu, Xin Wang, Fangming Li, Jiayu Chen</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 15:09:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17086v1</guid></item><item><title>Policy Learning with Distributional Welfare</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15878v2</link><description>In this paper, we explore optimal treatment allocation policies that targetdistributional welfare. Most literature on treatment choice has consideredutilitarian welfare based on the conditional average treatment effect (ATE).While average welfare is intuitive, it may yield undesirable allocationsespecially when individuals are heterogeneous (e.g., with outliers) - the veryreason individualized treatments were introduced in the first place. Thisobservation motivates us to propose an optimal policy that allocates thetreatment based on the conditional quantile of individual treatment effects(QoTE). Depending on the choice of the quantile probability, this criterion canaccommodate a policymaker who is either prudent or negligent. The challenge ofidentifying the QoTE lies in its requirement for knowledge of the jointdistribution of the counterfactual outcomes, which is generally hard to recovereven with experimental data. Therefore, we introduce minimax policies that arerobust to model uncertainty. A range of identifying assumptions can be used toyield more informative policies. For both stochastic and deterministicpolicies, we establish the asymptotic bound on the regret of implementing theproposed policies. In simulations and two empirical applications, we compareoptimal decisions based on the QoTE with decisions based on other criteria. Theframework can be generalized to any setting where welfare is defined as afunctional of the joint distribution of the potential outcomes.</description><author>Yifan Cui, Sukjin Han</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 15:07:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15878v2</guid></item><item><title>Dynamical Survival Analysis with Controlled Latent States</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17077v1</link><description>We consider the task of learning individual-specific intensities of countingprocesses from a set of static variables and irregularly sampled time series.We introduce a novel modelization approach in which the intensity is thesolution to a controlled differential equation.

Among the different panoramas and in contrast to standard centralones, non-central panoramas provide geometrical information in the distortionof the image from which we can retrieve 3D information of the environment [2].However, due to the lack of commercial non-central devices, up until now therewas no dataset of these kinds of panoramas. In this data paper, we present thefirst dataset of non-central panoramas for indoor scene understanding. Thedataset is composed by {\bf 2574} RGB non-central panoramas taken in around 650different rooms. Each panorama has associated a depth map and annotations toobtain the layout of the room from the image as a structural edge map, list ofcorners in the image, the 3D corners of the room and the camera pose.

However, many current works rely on manualevaluation to judge the quality of generated responses. Since such manualevaluation is time-consuming, it does not easily scale to the evaluation ofmultiple models and model variants. In this short paper, we propose astraightforward but remarkably effective evaluation metric called SemScore, inwhich we directly compare model outputs to gold target responses using semantictextual similarity (STS). We conduct a comparative evaluation of the modeloutputs of 12 prominent instruction-tuned LLMs using 8 widely-used evaluationmetrics for text generation. We find that our proposed SemScore metricoutperforms all other, in many cases more complex, evaluation metrics in termsof correlation to human evaluation. These findings indicate the utility of ourproposed metric for the evaluation of instruction-tuned LLMs.</description><author>Ansar Aynetdinov, Alan Akbik</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 14:52:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17072v1</guid></item><item><title>Discrete Graph Auto-Encoder</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07735v2</link><description>Despite advances in generative methods, accurately modeling the distributionof graphs remains a challenging task primarily because of the absence ofpredefined or inherent unique graph representation. Two main strategies haveemerged to tackle this issue: 1) restricting the number of possiblerepresentations by sorting the nodes, or 2) usingpermutation-invariant/equivariant functions, specifically Graph Neural Networks(GNNs). In this paper, we introduce a new framework named Discrete Graph Auto-Encoder(DGAE), which leverages the strengths of both strategies and mitigate theirrespective limitations. In essence, we propose a strategy in 2 steps. We firstuse a permutation-equivariant auto-encoder to convert graphs into sets ofdiscrete latent node representations, each node being represented by a sequenceof quantized vectors. In the second step, we sort the sets of discrete latentrepresentations and learn their distribution with a specifically designedauto-regressive model based on the Transformer architecture. Through multiple experimental evaluations, we demonstrate the competitiveperformances of our model in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art acrossvarious datasets. Various ablation studies support the interest of our method.</description><author>Yoann Boget, Magda Gregorova, Alexandros Kalousis</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 14:46:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07735v2</guid></item><item><title>Efficient Gesture Recognition on Spiking Convolutional Networks Through Sensor Fusion of Event-Based and Depth Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17064v1</link><description>As intelligent systems become increasingly important in our daily lives, newways of interaction are needed.

However, the distortion of theseimages requires the development of specific algorithms for their treatment andinterpretation. Moreover, a high number of images is essential for the correcttraining of computer vision algorithms based on learning. In this paper, wepresent a tool for generating datasets of omnidirectional images with semanticand depth information. These images are synthesized from a set of captures thatare acquired in a realistic virtual environment for Unreal Engine 4 through aninterface plugin. We gather a variety of well-known projection models such asequirectangular and cylindrical panoramas, different fish-eye lenses,catadioptric systems, and empiric models. Furthermore, we include in our toolphotorealistic non-central-projection systems as non-central panoramas andnon-central catadioptric systems. As far as we know, this is the first reportedtool for generating photorealistic non-central images in the literature.Moreover, since the omnidirectional images are made virtually, we providepixel-wise information about semantics and depth as well as perfect knowledgeof the calibration parameters of the cameras. This allows the creation ofground-truth information with pixel precision for training learning algorithmsand testing 3D vision approaches. To validate the proposed tool, differentcomputer vision algorithms are tested as line extractions from dioptric andcatadioptric central images, 3D Layout recovery and SLAM using equirectangularpanoramas, and 3D reconstruction from non-central panoramas.</description><author>Bruno Berenguel-Baeta, Jesus Bermudez-Cameo, Jose J.

Previous works focus onobstacle avoidance, however they do not have a general view of the environmentthey are moving in. New devices based on computer vision systems can helpimpaired people to overcome the difficulties of navigating in unknownenvironments in safe conditions. In this work it is proposed a combination ofsensors and algorithms that can lead to the building of a navigation system forvisually impaired people. Based on traditional systems that use RGB-D camerasfor obstacle avoidance, it is included and combined the information of afish-eye camera, which will give a better understanding of the user'ssurroundings. The combination gives robustness and reliability to the system aswell as a wide field of view that allows to obtain many information from theenvironment. This combination of sensors is inspired by human vision where thecenter of the retina (fovea) provides more accurate information than theperiphery, where humans have a wider field of view.

Through per-block fitting, all training blocksare converted into the hybrid neural fields: with a tri-plane containing thegeometry features, followed by a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) for decoding thesigned distance values. A variational auto-encoder is employed to compress thetri-planes into the latent tri-plane space, on which the denoising diffusionprocess is performed. Diffusion applied to the latent representations allowsfor high-quality and diverse 3D scene generation. To expand a scene duringgeneration, one needs only to append empty blocks to overlap with the currentscene and extrapolate existing latent tri-planes to populate new blocks. Theextrapolation is done by conditioning the generation process with the featuresamples from the overlapping tri-planes during the denoising iterations. Latenttri-plane extrapolation produces semantically and geometrically meaningfultransitions that harmoniously blend with the existing scene. A 2D layoutconditioning mechanism is used to control the placement and arrangement ofscene elements. Experimental results indicate that BlockFusion is capable ofgenerating diverse, geometrically consistent and unbounded large 3D scenes withunprecedented high-quality shapes in both indoor and outdoor scenarios.</description><author>Zhennan Wu, Yang Li, Han Yan, Taizhang Shang, Weixuan Sun, Senbo Wang, Ruikai Cui, Weizhe Liu, Hiroyuki Sato, Hongdong Li, Pan Ji</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 14:34:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17053v1</guid></item><item><title>Making Parametric Anomaly Detection on Tabular Data Non-Parametric Again</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17052v1</link><description>Deep learning for tabular data has garnered increasing attention in recentyears, yet employing deep models for structured data remains challenging.

Existing methods often resort to post-hoc techniques orprototypes to explain the decision-making process, which can be indirect andlack intrinsic illustration. In this research, we introduce ViTree, a novelapproach for fine-grained visual categorization that combines the popularvision transformer as a feature extraction backbone with neural decision trees.By traversing the tree paths, ViTree effectively selects patches fromtransformer-processed features to highlight informative local regions, therebyrefining representations in a step-wise manner. Unlike previous tree-basedmodels that rely on soft distributions or ensembles of paths, ViTree selects asingle tree path, offering a clearer and simpler decision-making process. Thispatch and path selectivity enhances model interpretability of ViTree, enablingbetter insights into the model's inner workings. Remarkably, extensiveexperimentation validates that this streamlined approach surpasses variousstrong competitors and achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintainingexceptional interpretability which is proved by multi-perspective methods.

In this framework, the generalizationerror of an algorithm is linked to a variable-size 'compression rate' of itsinput data. This is shown to yield bounds that depend on the empirical measureof the given input data at hand, rather than its unknown distribution. Our newgeneralization bounds that we establish are tail bounds, tail bounds on theexpectation, and in-expectations bounds. Moreover, it is shown that ourframework also allows to derive general bounds on any function of the inputdata and output hypothesis random variables. In particular, these generalbounds are shown to subsume and possibly improve over several existingPAC-Bayes and data-dependent intrinsic dimension-based bounds that arerecovered as special cases, thus unveiling a unifying character of ourapproach. For instance, a new data-dependent intrinsic dimension-based bound isestablished, which connects the generalization error to the optimizationtrajectories and reveals various interesting connections with therate-distortion dimension of a process, the R\'enyi information dimension of aprocess, and the metric mean dimension.</description><author>Milad Sefidgaran, Abdellatif Zaidi</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 14:30:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05369v2</guid></item><item><title>Explaining Explanations in Probabilistic Logic Programming</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17045v1</link><description>The emergence of tools based on artificial intelligence has also led to theneed of producing explanations which are understandable by a human being.

In this setting, one can say that models are interpretable, whicheases its understanding. However, given a particular query, the usual notion of"explanation" is associated with a set of choices, one for each random variableof the model. Unfortunately, this set does not have a causal structure and, infact, some of the choices are actually irrelevant to the considered query.

This method addresses common LLM limitations, includingoutdated information and the tendency to produce inaccurate "hallucinated"content. However, the evaluation of RAG systems is challenging, as existingbenchmarks are limited in scope and diversity. Most of the current benchmarkspredominantly assess question-answering applications, overlooking the broaderspectrum of situations where RAG could prove advantageous. Moreover, they onlyevaluate the performance of the LLM component of the RAG pipeline in theexperiments, and neglect the influence of the retrieval component and theexternal knowledge database. To address these issues, this paper constructs alarge-scale and more comprehensive benchmark, and evaluates all the componentsof RAG systems in various RAG application scenarios. Specifically, we havecategorized the range of RAG applications into four distinct types-Create,Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD), each representing a unique use case. "Create"refers to scenarios requiring the generation of original, varied content."Read" involves responding to intricate questions in knowledge-intensivesituations. "Update" focuses on revising and rectifying inaccuracies orinconsistencies in pre-existing texts. "Delete" pertains to the task ofsummarizing extensive texts into more concise forms. For each of these CRUDcategories, we have developed comprehensive datasets to evaluate theperformance of RAG systems. We also analyze the effects of various componentsof the RAG system, such as the retriever, the context length, the knowledgebase construction, and the LLM. Finally, we provide useful insights foroptimizing the RAG technology for different scenarios.</description><author>Yuanjie Lyu, Zhiyu Li, Simin Niu, Feiyu Xiong, Bo Tang, Wenjin Wang, Hao Wu, Huanyong Liu, Tong Xu, Enhong Chen</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 14:25:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17043v1</guid></item></channel></rss>
