Most existing solutions maintain the memory by compressing historical frames with predefined strategies. However, different to-generate video chunks should refer to different historical cues, which is hard to satisfy with fixed strategies. In this work, we propose MemFlow to address this problem. Specifically, before generating the coming chunk, we dynamically update the memory bank by retrieving the most relevant historical frames with the text prompt of this chunk. This design enables narrative coherence even if new event happens or scenario switches in future frames. In addition, during generation, we only activate the most relevant tokens in the memory bank for each query in the attention layers, which effectively guarantees the generation efficiency. In this way, MemFlow achieves outstanding long-context consistency with negligible computation burden (7.9% speed reduction compared with the memory-free baseline) and keeps the compatibility with any streaming video generation model with KV cache.</description><author>Sihui Ji, Xi Chen, Shuai Yang, Xin Tao, Pengfei Wan, Hengshuang Zhao</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14699v1</guid></item><item><title>TimeLens: Rethinking Video Temporal Grounding with Multimodal LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14698v1</link><description>This paper does not introduce a novel method but instead establishes a straightforward, incremental, yet essential baseline for video temporal grounding (VTG), a core capability in video understanding. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at various video understanding tasks, the recipes for optimizing them for VTG remain under-explored. In this paper, we present TimeLens, a systematic investigation into building MLLMs with strong VTG ability, along two primary dimensions: data quality and algorithmic design. We first expose critical quality issues in existing VTG benchmarks and introduce TimeLens-Bench, comprising meticulously re-annotated versions of three popular benchmarks with strict quality criteria. Our analysis reveals dramatic model re-rankings compared to legacy benchmarks, confirming the unreliability of prior evaluation standards. We also address noisy training data through an automated re-annotation pipeline, yielding TimeLens-100K, a large-scale, high-quality training dataset. Building on our data foundation, we conduct in-depth explorations of algorithmic design principles, yielding a series of meaningful insights and effective yet efficient practices. These include interleaved textual encoding for time representation, a thinking-free reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) approach as the training paradigm, and carefully designed recipes for RLVR training. These efforts culminate in TimeLens models, a family of MLLMs with state-of-the-art VTG performance among open-source models and even surpass proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. All codes, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.</description><author>Jun Zhang, Teng Wang, Yuying Ge, Yixiao Ge, Xinhao Li, Ying Shan, Limin Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:59:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14698v1</guid></item><item><title>Spherical Leech Quantization for Visual Tokenization and Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14697v1</link><description>Non-parametric quantization has received much attention due to its efficiency on parameters and scalability to a large codebook. In this paper, we present a unified formulation of different non-parametric quantization methods through the lens of lattice coding. The geometry of lattice codes explains the necessity of auxiliary loss terms when training auto-encoders with certain existing lookup-free quantization variants such as BSQ. As a step forward, we explore a few possible candidates, including random lattices, generalized Fibonacci lattices, and densest sphere packing lattices. Among all, we find the Leech lattice-based quantization method, which is dubbed as Spherical Leech Quantization ($Λ_{24}$-SQ), leads to both a simplified training recipe and an improved reconstruction-compression tradeoff thanks to its high symmetry and even distribution on the hypersphere. In image tokenization and compression tasks, this quantization approach achieves better reconstruction quality across all metrics than BSQ, the best prior art, while consuming slightly fewer bits. The improvement also extends to state-of-the-art auto-regressive image generation frameworks.</description><author>Yue Zhao, Hanwen Jiang, Zhenlin Xu, Chutong Yang, Ehsan Adeli, Philipp Krähenbühl</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:59:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14697v1</guid></item><item><title>CRISP: Contact-Guided Real2Sim from Monocular Video with Planar Scene Primitives</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14696v1</link><description>We introduce CRISP, a method that recovers simulatable human motion and scene geometry from monocular video. Prior work on joint human-scene reconstruction relies on data-driven priors and joint optimization with no physics in the loop, or recovers noisy geometry with artifacts that cause motion tracking policies with scene interactions to fail. In contrast, our key insight is to recover convex, clean, and simulation-ready geometry by fitting planar primitives to a point cloud reconstruction of the scene, via a simple clustering pipeline over depth, normals, and flow. To reconstruct scene geometry that might be occluded during interactions, we make use of human-scene contact modeling (e.g., we use human posture to reconstruct the occluded seat of a chair). Finally, we ensure that human and scene reconstructions are physically-plausible by using them to drive a humanoid controller via reinforcement learning. Our approach reduces motion tracking failure rates from 55.2\% to 6.9\% on human-centric video benchmarks (EMDB, PROX), while delivering a 43\% faster RL simulation throughput. We further validate it on in-the-wild videos including casually-captured videos, Internet videos, and even Sora-generated videos. This demonstrates CRISP's ability to generate physically-valid human motion and interaction environments at scale, greatly advancing real-to-sim applications for robotics and AR/VR.</description><author>Zihan Wang, Jiashun Wang, Jeff Tan, Yiwen Zhao, Jessica Hodgins, Shubham Tulsiani, Deva Ramanan</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:59:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14696v1</guid></item><item><title>Love First, Know Later: Persona-Based Romantic Compatibility Through LLM Text World Engines</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11844v2</link><description>We propose Love First, Know Later: a paradigm shift in computational matching that simulates interactions first, then assesses compatibility. Instead of comparing static profiles, our framework leverages LLMs as text world engines that operate in dual capacity-as persona-driven agents following behavioral policies and as the environment modeling interaction dynamics. We formalize compatibility assessment as a reward-modeling problem: given observed matching outcomes, we learn to extract signals from simulations that predict human preferences. Our key insight is that relationships hinge on responses to critical moments-we translate this observation from relationship psychology into mathematical hypotheses, enabling effective simulation. Theoretically, we prove that as LLM policies better approximate human behavior, the induced matching converges to optimal stable matching. Empirically, we validate on speed dating data for initial chemistry and divorce prediction for long-term stability. This paradigm enables interactive, personalized matching systems where users iteratively refine their agents, unlocking future possibilities for transparent and interactive compatibility assessment.</description><author>Haoyang Shang, Zhengyang Yan, Xuan Liu</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:59:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11844v2</guid></item><item><title>Universal Reasoning Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14693v1</link><description>Universal transformers (UTs) have been widely used for complex reasoning tasks such as ARC-AGI and Sudoku, yet the specific sources of their performance gains remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically analyze UTs variants and show that improvements on ARC-AGI primarily arise from the recurrent inductive bias and strong nonlinear components of Transformer, rather than from elaborate architectural designs. Motivated by this finding, we propose the Universal Reasoning Model (URM), which enhances the UT with short convolution and truncated backpropagation. Our approach substantially improves reasoning performance, achieving state-of-the-art 53.8% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 1 and 16.0% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 2.

This paper present an approach for learning a structured latent representation from native 3D data to address this challenge. At its core is a new sparse voxel structure called O-Voxel, an omni-voxel representation that encodes both geometry and appearance. O-Voxel can robustly model arbitrary topology, including open, non-manifold, and fully-enclosed surfaces, while capturing comprehensive surface attributes beyond texture color, such as physically-based rendering parameters. Based on O-Voxel, we design a Sparse Compression VAE which provides a high spatial compression rate and a compact latent space. We train large-scale flow-matching models comprising 4B parameters for 3D generation using diverse public 3D asset datasets. Despite their scale, inference remains highly efficient. Meanwhile, the geometry and material quality of our generated assets far exceed those of existing models. We believe our approach offers a significant advancement in 3D generative modeling.</description><author>Jianfeng Xiang, Xiaoxue Chen, Sicheng Xu, Ruicheng Wang, Zelong Lv, Yu Deng, Hongyuan Zhu, Yue Dong, Hao Zhao, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Jiaolong Yang</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:58:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14692v1</guid></item><item><title>MMGR: Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14691v1</link><description>Video foundation models generate visually realistic and temporally coherent content, but their reliability as world simulators depends on whether they capture physical, logical, and spatial constraints. Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.</description><author>Zefan Cai, Haoyi Qiu, Tianyi Ma, Haozhe Zhao, Gengze Zhou, Kung-Hsiang Huang, Parisa Kordjamshidi, Minjia Zhang, Xiao Wen, Jiuxiang Gu, Nanyun Peng, Junjie Hu</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:58:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14691v1</guid></item><item><title>CHIP: Adaptive Compliance for Humanoid Control through Hindsight Perturbation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14689v1</link><description>Recent progress in humanoid robots has unlocked agile locomotion skills, including backflipping, running, and crawling. Yet it remains challenging for a humanoid robot to perform forceful manipulation tasks such as moving objects, wiping, and pushing a cart. We propose adaptive Compliance Humanoid control through hIsight Perturbation (CHIP), a plug-and-play module that enables controllable end-effector stiffness while preserving agile tracking of dynamic reference motions. CHIP is easy to implement and requires neither data augmentation nor additional reward tuning. We show that a generalist motion-tracking controller trained with CHIP can perform a diverse set of forceful manipulation tasks that require different end-effector compliance, such as multi-robot collaboration, wiping, box delivery, and door opening.</description><author>Sirui Chen, Zi-ang Cao, Zhengyi Luo, Fernando Castañeda, Chenran Li, Tingwu Wang, Ye Yuan, Linxi "Jim" Fan, C.

However, research on emotion-aware or spoken dialogue summarization is constrained by the lack of data that links speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues. We introduce Spoken DialogSum, the first corpus aligning raw conversational audio with factual summaries, emotion-rich summaries, and utterance-level labels for speaker age, gender, and emotion. The dataset is built in two stages: first, an LLM rewrites DialogSum scripts with Switchboard-style fillers and back-channels, then tags each utterance with emotion, pitch, and speaking rate. Second, an expressive TTS engine synthesizes speech from the tagged scripts, aligned with paralinguistic labels. Spoken DialogSum comprises 13,460 emotion-diverse dialogues, each paired with both a factual and an emotion-focused summary. The dataset is available online at https://fatfat-emosum.github.io/EmoDialog-Sum-Audio-Samples/. Baselines show that an Audio-LLM raises emotional-summary ROUGE-L by 28% relative to a cascaded ASR-LLM system, confirming the value of end-to-end speech modeling.</description><author>Yen-Ju Lu, Kunxiao Gao, Mingrui Liang, Helin Wang, Thomas Thebaud, Laureano Moro-Velazquez, Najim Dehak, Jesus Villalba</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:54:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14687v1</guid></item><item><title>Bias-Variance Trade-off for Clipped Stochastic First-Order Methods: From Bounded Variance to Infinite Mean</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14686v1</link><description>Stochastic optimization is fundamental to modern machine learning. Recent research has extended the study of stochastic first-order methods (SFOMs) from light-tailed to heavy-tailed noise, which frequently arises in practice, with clipping emerging as a key technique for controlling heavy-tailed gradients. Extensive theoretical advances have further shown that the oracle complexity of SFOMs depends on the tail index $α$ of the noise. Nonetheless, existing complexity results often cover only the case $α\in (1,2]$, that is, the regime where the noise has a finite mean, while the complexity bounds tend to infinity as $α$ approaches $1$. This paper tackles the general case of noise with tail index $α\in(0,2]$, covering regimes ranging from noise with bounded variance to noise with an infinite mean, where the latter case has been scarcely studied. Through a novel analysis of the bias-variance trade-off in gradient clipping, we show that when a symmetry measure of the noise tail is controlled, clipped SFOMs achieve improved complexity guarantees in the presence of heavy-tailed noise for any tail index $α\in (0,2]$. Our analysis of the bias-variance trade-off not only yields new unified complexity guarantees for clipped SFOMs across this full range of tail indices, but is also straightforward to apply and can be combined with classical analyses under light-tailed noise to establish oracle complexity guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Finally, numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.</description><author>Chuan He</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:52:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14686v1</guid></item><item><title>Misspecification-robust amortised simulation-based inference using variational methods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05724v3</link><description>Recent advances in neural density estimation have enabled powerful simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that can flexibly approximate Bayesian inference for intractable stochastic models. Although these methods have demonstrated reliable posterior estimation when the simulator accurately represents the underlying data generative process (DGP), recent work has shown that they perform poorly in the presence of model misspecification. This poses a significant issue for their use in real-world problems, due to simulators always misrepresenting the true DGP to a certain degree. In this paper, we introduce robust variational neural posterior estimation (RVNP), a method which addresses the problem of misspecification in amortised SBI by bridging the simulation-to-reality gap using variational inference and error modelling. We test RVNP on multiple benchmark tasks, including using real data from astronomy, and show that it can recover robust posterior inference in a data-driven manner without adopting hyperparameters or priors governing the misspecification influence.</description><author>Matthew O'Callaghan, Kaisey S.

Early identification of patients at risk for deterioration is essential not only for patient care quality monitoring but also for physician care management. However, translating varied data streams into accurate and interpretable risk assessments poses significant challenges due to inconsistent data formats. We develop a multimodal machine learning framework, the Early Warning Index (EWI), to predict the aggregate risk of ICU admission, emergency response team dispatch, and mortality. Key to EWI's design is a human-in-the-loop process: clinicians help determine alert thresholds and interpret model outputs, which are enhanced by explainable outputs using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to highlight clinical and operational factors (e.g., scheduled surgeries, ward census) driving each patient's risk. We deploy EWI in a hospital dashboard that stratifies patients into three risk tiers. Using a dataset of 18,633 unique patients at a large U.S. hospital, our approach automatically extracts features from both structured and unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data and achieves C-statistics of 0.796. It is currently used as a triage tool for proactively managing at-risk patients. The proposed approach saves physicians valuable time by automatically sorting patients of varying risk levels, allowing them to concentrate on patient care rather than sifting through complex EHR data. By further pinpointing specific risk drivers, the proposed model provides data-informed adjustments to caregiver scheduling and allocation of critical resources. As a result, clinicians and administrators can avert downstream complications, including costly procedures or high readmission rates and improve overall patient flow.</description><author>Dimitris Bertsimas, Yu Ma, Kimberly Villalobos Carballo, Gagan Singh, Michal Laskowski, Jeff Mather, Dan Kombert, Howard Haronian</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:47:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14683v1</guid></item><item><title>TomoGraphView: 3D Medical Image Classification with Omnidirectional Slice Representations and Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09605v3</link><description>The sharp rise in medical tomography examinations has created a demand for automated systems that can reliably extract informative features for downstream tasks such as tumor characterization. Although 3D volumes contain richer information than individual slices, effective 3D classification remains difficult: volumetric data encode complex spatial dependencies, and the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets has constrained progress toward 3D foundation models. As a result, many recent approaches rely on 2D vision foundation models trained on natural images, repurposing them as feature extractors for medical scans with surprisingly strong performance. Despite their practical success, current methods that apply 2D foundation models to 3D scans via slice-based decomposition remain fundamentally limited. Standard slicing along axial, sagittal, and coronal planes often fails to capture the true spatial extent of a structure when its orientation does not align with these canonical views. More critically, most approaches aggregate slice features independently, ignoring the underlying 3D geometry and losing spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. Instead of restricting the model to axial, sagittal, or coronal planes, our method samples both canonical and non-canonical cross-sections generated from uniformly distributed points on a sphere enclosing the volume. We publicly share our accessible code base at http://github.com/compai-lab/2025-MedIA-kiechle and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at https://pypi.org/project/OmniSlicer.</description><author>Johannes Kiechle, Stefan M.

However, benchmarking practices remain fragmented, often relying on narrow, task-specific datasets and inconsistent evaluation protocols, which hampers reproducibility and broader progress. To address this, we introduce GraphBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that spans diverse domains and prediction tasks, including node-level, edge-level, graph-level, and generative settings. GraphBench provides standardized evaluation protocols -- with consistent dataset splits and performance metrics that account for out-of-distribution generalization -- as well as a unified hyperparameter tuning framework. Additionally, we benchmark GraphBench using message-passing neural networks and graph transformer models, providing principled baselines and establishing a reference performance.

Recent efforts primarily explore diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) for parallel decoding to reduce inference latency. To achieve AR-level generation quality, many techniques adapt AR models into dLLMs to enable parallel decoding. However, they suffer from limited speedup compared to AR models due to a pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch. Specifically, the masked data distribution in post-training deviates significantly from the real-world data distribution seen during pretraining, and dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal prior learned during pretraining and hinders the integration of exact KV cache reuse. To address this, we introduce Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference property. The models trained under this paradigm, Jacobi Forcing Model, achieves 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal loss in performance. Based on Jacobi Forcing Models' trajectory characteristics, we introduce multi-block decoding with rejection recycling, which enables up to 4.5x higher token acceptance count per iteration and nearly 4.0x wall-clock speedup, effectively trading additional compute for lower inference latency.

This research tackles two major challenges: capturing the subtle expression details present in real human faces, and reconstructing an intricate 3D head avatar from a single portrait image. To accurately model expression details, VASA-3D leverages the motion latent of VASA-1, a method that yields exceptional realism and vividness in 2D talking heads. A critical element of our work is translating this motion latent to 3D, which is accomplished by devising a 3D head model that is conditioned on the motion latent. Customization of this model to a single image is achieved through an optimization framework that employs numerous video frames of the reference head synthesized from the input image. The optimization takes various training losses robust to artifacts and limited pose coverage in the generated training data. Our experiment shows that VASA-3D produces realistic 3D talking heads that cannot be achieved by prior art, and it supports the online generation of 512x512 free-viewpoint videos at up to 75 FPS, facilitating more immersive engagements with lifelike 3D avatars.</description><author>Sicheng Xu, Guojun Chen, Jiaolong Yang, Yizhong Zhang, Yu Deng, Steve Lin, Baining Guo</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:44:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14677v1</guid></item><item><title>VIBE: Can a VLM Read the Room?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11162v2</link><description>Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the performance of several VLMs on it.</description><author>Tania Chakraborty, Eylon Caplan, Dan Goldwasser</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:42:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11162v2</guid></item><item><title>Beyond Lipschitz Continuity and Monotonicity: Fractal and Chaotic Activation Functions in Echo State Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14675v1</link><description>Contemporary reservoir computing relies heavily on smooth, globally Lipschitz continuous activation functions, limiting applications in defense, disaster response, and pharmaceutical modeling where robust operation under extreme conditions is critical. We systematically investigate non-smooth activation functions, including chaotic, stochastic, and fractal variants, in echo state networks. Through comprehensive parameter sweeps across 36,610 reservoir configurations, we demonstrate that several non-smooth functions not only maintain the Echo State Property (ESP) but outperform traditional smooth activations in convergence speed and spectral radius tolerance. Notably, the Cantor function (continuous everywhere and flat almost everywhere) maintains ESP-consistent behavior up to spectral radii of rho ~ 10, an order of magnitude beyond typical bounds for smooth functions, while achieving 2.6x faster convergence than tanh and ReLU. We introduce a theoretical framework for quantized activation functions, defining a Degenerate Echo State Property (d-ESP) that captures stability for discrete-output functions and proving that d-ESP implies traditional ESP. We identify a critical crowding ratio Q=N/k (reservoir size / quantization levels) that predicts failure thresholds for discrete activations. Our analysis reveals that preprocessing topology, rather than continuity per se, determines stability: monotone, compressive preprocessing maintains ESP across scales, while dispersive or discontinuous preprocessing triggers sharp failures. While our findings challenge assumptions about activation function design in reservoir computing, the mechanism underlying the exceptional performance of certain fractal functions remains unexplained, suggesting fundamental gaps in our understanding of how geometric properties of activation functions influence reservoir dynamics.</description><author>Rae Chipera, Jenny Du, Irene Tsapara</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:41:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14675v1</guid></item><item><title>COMMA: A Communicative Multimodal Multi-Agent Benchmark</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07553v5</link><description>The rapid advances of multimodal agents built on large foundation models have largely overlooked their potential for language-based communication between agents in collaborative tasks. This oversight presents a critical gap in understanding their effectiveness in real-world deployments, particularly when communicating with humans. Existing agentic benchmarks fail to address key aspects of inter-agent communication and collaboration, particularly in scenarios where agents have unequal access to information and must work together to achieve tasks beyond the scope of individual capabilities. To fill this gap, we introduce COMMA: a novel puzzle benchmark designed to evaluate the collaborative performance of multimodal multi-agent systems through language communication. Our benchmark features a variety of multimodal puzzles, providing a comprehensive evaluation across four key categories of agentic capability in a communicative collaboration setting. Our findings reveal surprising weaknesses in state-of-the-art models, including strong proprietary models like GPT-4o and reasoning models like o4-mini.

Various strategies like byte-level representations or calendar tokens have been proposed. However, the optimal approach remains unclear, especially given the diverse statistical distributions of real-world event data, which range from smooth log-normal to discrete, spiky patterns. This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions. Our analysis reveals that no single strategy is universally superior; instead, prediction performance depends heavily on aligning the tokenizer with the data's statistical properties, with log-based strategies excelling on skewed distributions and human-centric formats proving robust for mixed modalities.</description><author>Zefang Liu, Nam H.

Previous methods for articulated object reconstruction either rely on slow optimization with fragile cross-state correspondences or use feed-forward models limited to specific object categories. In contrast, ART treats articulated objects as assemblies of rigid parts, formulating reconstruction as part-based prediction. Our newly designed transformer architecture maps sparse image inputs to a set of learnable part slots, from which ART jointly decodes unified representations for individual parts, including their 3D geometry, texture, and explicit articulation parameters. The resulting reconstructions are physically interpretable and readily exportable for simulation. Trained on a large-scale, diverse dataset with per-part supervision, and evaluated across diverse benchmarks, ART achieves significant improvements over existing baselines and establishes a new state of the art for articulated object reconstruction from image inputs.</description><author>Zizhang Li, Cheng Zhang, Zhengqin Li, Henry Howard-Jenkins, Zhaoyang Lv, Chen Geng, Jiajun Wu, Richard Newcombe, Jakob Engel, Zhao Dong</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:35:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14671v1</guid></item><item><title>EVOLVE-VLA: Test-Time Training from Environment Feedback for Vision-Language-Action Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14666v1</link><description>Achieving truly adaptive embodied intelligence requires agents that learn not just by imitating static demonstrations, but by continuously improving through environmental interaction, which is akin to how humans master skills through practice. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by leveraging large language models, yet remain fundamentally limited by Supervised Finetuning (SFT): requiring hundreds of demonstrations per task, rigidly memorizing trajectories, and failing to adapt when deployment conditions deviate from training. We introduce EVOLVE-VLA, a test-time training framework enabling VLAs to continuously adapt through environment interaction with minimal or zero task-specific demonstrations. The key technical challenge is replacing oracle reward signals (unavailable at test time) with autonomous feedback. We address this through a learned progress estimator providing dense feedback, and critically, we design our framework to ``tame'' this inherently noisy signal via two mechanisms: (1) an accumulative progress estimation mechanism smoothing noisy point-wise estimates, and (2) a progressive horizon extension strategy enabling gradual policy evolution. EVOLVE-VLA achieves substantial gains: +8.6\% on long-horizon tasks, +22.0\% in 1-shot learning, and enables cross-task generalization -- achieving 20.8\% success on unseen tasks without task-specific demonstrations training (vs. 0\% for pure SFT). Qualitative analysis reveals emergent capabilities absent in demonstrations, including error recovery and novel strategies. This work represents a critical step toward VLAs that truly learn and adapt, moving beyond static imitation toward continuous self-improvements.</description><author>Zechen Bai, Chen Gao, Mike Zheng Shou</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:26:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14666v1</guid></item><item><title>Enhancing Visual Sentiment Analysis via Semiotic Isotopy-Guided Dataset Construction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14665v1</link><description>Visual Sentiment Analysis (VSA) is a challenging task due to the vast diversity of emotionally salient images and the inherent difficulty of acquiring sufficient data to capture this variability comprehensively. Key obstacles include building large-scale VSA datasets and developing effective methodologies that enable algorithms to identify emotionally significant elements within an image. These challenges are reflected in the limited generalization performance of VSA algorithms and models when trained and tested across different datasets. Starting from a pool of existing data collections, our approach enables the creation of a new larger dataset that not only contains a wider variety of images than the original ones, but also permits training new models with improved capability to focus on emotionally relevant combinations of image elements. This is achieved through the integration of the semiotic isotopy concept within the dataset creation process, providing deeper insights into the emotional content of images.

Existing datasets and libraries face three main challenges: (1) lack of realistic stochastic load and topology perturbations, limiting scenario diversity; (2) PF datasets are restricted to OPF-feasible points, hindering generalization of ML solvers to cases that violate operating limits (e.g., branch overloads or voltage violations); and (3) OPF datasets use fixed generator cost functions, limiting generalization across varying costs. gridfm-datakit addresses these challenges by: (1) combining global load scaling from real-world profiles with localized noise and supporting arbitrary N-k topology perturbations to create diverse yet realistic datasets; (2) generating PF samples beyond operating limits; and (3) producing OPF data with varying generator costs.

WaveSim exploits wavelet transforms to decompose input fields into scale-specific wavelet coefficients. The metric is built by multiplying three orthogonal components derived from these coefficients: Magnitude, which quantifies similarities in the energy distribution of the coefficients, i.e., the intensity of the field; Displacement, which captures spatial shift by comparing the centers of mass of normalized energy distributions; and Structure, which assesses pattern organization independent of location and amplitude. Each component yields a scale-specific similarity score ranging from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (perfect similarity), which are then combined across scales to produce an overall similarity measure. We first evaluate WaveSim using synthetic test cases, applying controlled spatial and temporal perturbations to systematically assess its sensitivity and expected behavior. We then demonstrate its applicability to physically relevant case studies of key modes of climate variability in Earth System Models. Traditional point-wise metrics lack a mechanism for attributing errors to physical scales or modes of dissimilarity. By operating in the wavelet domain and decomposing the signal along independent axes, WaveSim bypasses these limitations and provides an interpretable and diagnostically rich framework for assessing similarity in complex fields. Additionally, the WaveSim framework allows users to place emphasis on a specific scale or component, and lends itself to user-specific model intercomparison, model evaluation, and calibration and training of forecasting systems.

Existing MLLMs typically perform textual reasoning solely from a single static mathematical image, overlooking dynamic visual acquisition during reasoning. In contrast, humans repeatedly examine visual image and employ step-by-step reasoning to prove intermediate propositions. This strategy of decomposing the problem-solving process into key logical nodes adheres to Miller's Law in cognitive science. Inspired by this insight, we propose a ViRC framework for multimodal mathematical tasks, introducing a Reason Chunking mechanism that structures multimodal mathematical CoT into consecutive Critical Reasoning Units (CRUs) to simulate human expert problem-solving patterns. CRUs ensure intra-unit textual coherence for intermediate proposition verification while integrating visual information across units to generate subsequent propositions and support structured reasoning. To this end, we present CRUX dataset by using three visual tools and four reasoning patterns to provide explicitly annotated CRUs across multiple reasoning paths for each mathematical problem. Leveraging the CRUX dataset, we propose a progressive training strategy inspired by human cognitive learning, which includes Instructional SFT, Practice SFT, and Strategic RL, aimed at further strengthening the Reason Chunking ability of the model.The resulting ViRC-7B model achieves a 18.8\% average improvement over baselines across multiple mathematical benchmarks.

AED models trained on segmented utterances learn to encode absolute frame positions by exploiting limited acoustic context beyond segment boundaries, but fail to generalize when decoding long-form segments where these cues vanish. The model loses ability to order acoustic encodings due to permutation invariance of keys and values in cross-attention. We propose four modifications: (1) injecting explicit absolute positional encodings into cross-attention for each decoded segment, (2) long-form training with extended acoustic context to eliminate implicit absolute position encoding, (3) segment concatenation to cover diverse segmentations needed during training, and (4) semantic segmentation to align AED-decoded segments with training segments. We show these modifications close the accuracy gap between continuous and segmented acoustic encodings, enabling auto-regressive use of the attention decoder.</description><author>Pawel Swietojanski, Xinwei Li, Mingbin Xu, Takaaki Hori, Dogan Can, Xiaodan Zhuang</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:12:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14652v1</guid></item><item><title>AI-GenBench: A New Ongoing Benchmark for AI-Generated Image Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20865v3</link><description>The rapid advancement of generative AI has revolutionized image creation, enabling high-quality synthesis from text prompts while raising critical challenges for media authenticity. We present Ai-GenBench, a novel benchmark designed to address the urgent need for robust detection of AI-generated images in real-world scenarios. Unlike existing solutions that evaluate models on static datasets, Ai-GenBench introduces a temporal evaluation framework where detection methods are incrementally trained on synthetic images, historically ordered by their generative models, to test their ability to generalize to new generative models, such as the transition from GANs to diffusion models. Our benchmark focuses on high-quality, diverse visual content and overcomes key limitations of current approaches, including arbitrary dataset splits, unfair comparisons, and excessive computational demands. Ai-GenBench provides a comprehensive dataset, a standardized evaluation protocol, and accessible tools for both researchers and non-experts (e.g., journalists, fact-checkers), ensuring reproducibility while maintaining practical training requirements. By establishing clear evaluation rules and controlled augmentation strategies, Ai-GenBench enables meaningful comparison of detection methods and scalable solutions.

In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout. Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated using higher-stochasticity SDE training.</description><author>Jiayuan Sheng, Hanyang Zhao, Haoxian Chen, David D.

The BraTS 2025 Lighthouse Challenge benchmarks segmentation methods on diverse high-quality datasets of adult and pediatric tumors: multi-consortium international pediatric brain tumor segmentation (PED), preoperative meningioma tumor segmentation (MEN), meningioma radiotherapy segmentation (MEN-RT), and segmentation of pre- and post-treatment brain metastases (MET). We present a flexible, modular, and adaptable pipeline that improves segmentation performance by selecting and combining state-of-the-art models and applying tumor- and lesion-specific processing before and after training. Radiomic features extracted from MRI help detect tumor subtype, ensuring a more balanced training. Custom lesion-level performance metrics determine the influence of each model in the ensemble and optimize post-processing that further refines the predictions, enabling the workflow to tailor every step to each case. On the BraTS testing sets, our pipeline achieved performance comparable to top-ranked algorithms across multiple challenges. These findings confirm that custom lesion-aware processing and model selection yield robust segmentations yet without locking the method to a specific network architecture.

In parallel, there has been growing interest in leveraging high-quality pre-trained visual representations, either by aligning them inside VAEs or directly within the generative model. However, adapting such representations remains challenging due to fundamental mismatches between understanding-oriented features and generation-friendly latent spaces. Representation encoders benefit from high-dimensional latents that capture diverse hypotheses for masked regions, whereas generative models favor low-dimensional latents that must faithfully preserve injected noise. This discrepancy has led prior work to rely on complex objectives and architectures. In this work, we propose FAE (Feature Auto-Encoder), a simple yet effective framework that adapts pre-trained visual representations into low-dimensional latents suitable for generation using as little as a single attention layer, while retaining sufficient information for both reconstruction and understanding. The key is to couple two separate deep decoders: one trained to reconstruct the original feature space, and a second that takes the reconstructed features as input for image generation. FAE is generic; it can be instantiated with a variety of self-supervised encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP) and plugged into two distinct generative families: diffusion models and normalizing flows. Across class-conditional and text-to-image benchmarks, FAE achieves strong performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256, our diffusion model with CFG attains a near state-of-the-art FID of 1.29 (800 epochs) and 1.70 (80 epochs). Without CFG, FAE reaches the state-of-the-art FID of 1.48 (800 epochs) and 2.08 (80 epochs), demonstrating both high quality and fast learning.</description><author>Yuan Gao, Chen Chen, Tianrong Chen, Jiatao Gu</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:04:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07829v2</guid></item><item><title>TiME: Tiny Monolingual Encoders for Efficient NLP Pipelines</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14645v1</link><description>Today, a lot of research on language models is focused on large, general-purpose models. However, many NLP pipelines only require models with a well-defined, small set of capabilities. While large models are capable of performing the tasks of those smaller models, they are simply not fast enough to process large amounts of data or offer real-time responses. Furthermore, they often use unnecessarily large amounts of energy, leading to sustainability concerns and problems when deploying them on battery-powered devices. In our work, we show how to train small models for such efficiency-critical applications. As opposed to many off-the-shelf NLP pipelines, our models use modern training techniques such as distillation, and offer support for low-resource languages. We call our models TiME (Tiny Monolingual Encoders) and comprehensively evaluate them on a range of common NLP tasks, observing an improved trade-off between benchmark performance on one hand, and throughput, latency and energy consumption on the other. Along the way, we show that distilling monolingual models from multilingual teachers is possible, and likewise distilling models with absolute positional embeddings from teachers with relative positional embeddings.</description><author>David Schulmeister, Valentin Hartmann, Lars Klein, Robert West</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:02:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14645v1</guid></item><item><title>Property-Isometric Variational Autoencoders for Sequence Modeling and Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14287v2</link><description>Biological sequence design (DNA, RNA, or peptides) with desired functional properties has applications in discovering novel nanomaterials, biosensors, antimicrobial drugs, and beyond. One common challenge is the ability to optimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of DNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and antimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely on simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than high-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a geometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which learns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property space. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold that can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an appropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide the sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder layers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized latent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired properties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our framework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template fluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The trained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent space according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ sampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to 16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance in training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.</description><author>Elham Sadeghi, Xianqi Deng, I-Hsin Lin, Stacy M.

Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring costly equipment, skilled personnel, and causing treatment delays. Deep learning methods could assist pathologists by extracting diagnostic information from routinely available HE-stained slides, yet comprehensive benchmarks for lymphoma subtyping on multicenter data are lacking. In this work, we present the first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy control tissue. We systematically evaluate five publicly available pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) combined with attention-based (AB-MIL) and transformer-based (TransMIL) multiple instance learning aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). On in-distribution test sets, models achieve multiclass balanced accuracies exceeding 80% across all magnifications, with all foundation models performing similarly and both aggregation methods showing comparable results. The magnification study reveals that 40x resolution is sufficient, with no performance gains from higher resolutions or cross-magnification aggregation. However, on out-of-distribution test sets, performance drops substantially to around 60%, highlighting significant generalization challenges. To advance the field, larger multicenter studies covering additional rare lymphoma subtypes are needed. We provide an automated benchmarking pipeline to facilitate such future research.</description><author>Rao Muhammad Umer, Daniel Sens, Jonathan Noll, Christian Matek, Lukas Wolfseher, Rainer Spang, Ralf Huss, Johannes Raffler, Sarah Reinke, Wolfram Klapper, Katja Steiger, Kristina Schwamborn, Carsten Marr</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:58:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14640v1</guid></item><item><title>Chase Anonymisation: Privacy-Preserving Knowledge Graphs with Logical Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12418v2</link><description>We propose a novel framework to enable Knowledge Graphs (KGs) sharing while ensuring that information that should remain private is not directly released nor indirectly exposed via derived knowledge, maintaining at the same time the embedded knowledge of the KGs to support business downstream tasks.

To effectively monitor glacier conditions, it is crucial to consistently estimate positional shifts of glacier calving fronts. AMD-HookNet firstly introduces a pure two-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) for glacier segmentation. Yet, the local nature and translational invariance of convolution operations, while beneficial for capturing low-level details, restricts the model ability to maintain long-range dependencies. In this study, we propose AMD-HookNet++, a novel advanced hybrid CNN-Transformer feature enhancement method for segmenting glaciers and delineating calving fronts in synthetic aperture radar images. Our hybrid structure consists of two branches: a Transformer-based context branch to capture long-range dependencies, which provides global contextual information in a larger view, and a CNN-based target branch to preserve local details. To strengthen the representation of the connected hybrid features, we devise an enhanced spatial-channel attention module to foster interactions between the hybrid CNN-Transformer branches through dynamically adjusting the token relationships from both spatial and channel perspectives. Additionally, we develop a pixel-to-pixel contrastive deep supervision to optimize our hybrid model by integrating pixelwise metric learning into glacier segmentation. Through extensive experiments and comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on the challenging glacier segmentation benchmark dataset CaFFe, we show that AMD-HookNet++ sets a new state of the art with an IoU of 78.2 and a HD95 of 1,318 m, while maintaining a competitive MDE of 367 m. More importantly, our hybrid model produces smoother delineations of calving fronts, resolving the issue of jagged edges typically seen in pure Transformer-based approaches.</description><author>Fei Wu, Marcel Dreier, Nora Gourmelon, Sebastian Wind, Jianlin Zhang, Thorsten Seehaus, Matthias Braun, Andreas Maier, Vincent Christlein</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:57:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14639v1</guid></item><item><title>Latent Self-Consistency for Reliable Majority-Set Selection in Short- and Long-Answer Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18395v2</link><description>Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions. Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on short-form benchmarks. We introduce \textbf{Latent Self-Consistency (LSC)}, which selects the most semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. LSC's lightweight forward processing of summary tokens only introduces negligible runtime overhead (at most $0.9\%$) on top of standard decoding of the base LLM, and requires no changes to the model architecture. Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU, TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC, and WUCS on both short-form and long-form on average performance, while adding negligible computational overhead on vanilla inference. These results position LSC as a reliable consistency-selection method that works effectively across various answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated confidence estimates, maintaining low expected calibration error across both answer formats.</description><author>Jungsuk Oh, Jay-Yoon Lee</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:50:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18395v2</guid></item><item><title>Trace Gadgets: Minimizing Code Context for Machine Learning-Based Vulnerability Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13676v2</link><description>As the number of web applications and API endpoints exposed to the Internet continues to grow, so does the number of exploitable vulnerabilities. Manually identifying such vulnerabilities is tedious. Meanwhile, static security scanners tend to produce many false positives. While machine learning-based approaches are promising, they typically perform well only in scenarios where training and test data are closely related. A key challenge for ML-based vulnerability detection is providing suitable and concise code context, as excessively long contexts negatively affect the code comprehension capabilities of machine learning models, particularly smaller ones. This work introduces Trace Gadgets, a novel code representation that minimizes code context by removing non-related code. Trace Gadgets precisely capture the statements that cover the path to the vulnerability. As input for ML models, Trace Gadgets provide a minimal but complete context, thereby improving the detection performance. Moreover, we collect a large-scale dataset generated from real-world applications with manually curated labels to further improve the performance of ML-based vulnerability detectors. Our results show that state-of-the-art machine learning models perform best when using Trace Gadgets compared to previous code representations, surpassing the detection capabilities of industry-standard static scanners such as GitHub's CodeQL by at least 4% on a fully unseen dataset.

Recent advances in music generation models have enabled diverse editing tasks such as timbre transfer, instrument substitution, and genre transformation. However, many existing works overlook the evaluation of their ability to preserve musical facets that should remain unchanged during editing a property we define as Music Context Preservation (MCP). While some studies do consider MCP, they adopt inconsistent evaluation protocols and metrics, leading to unreliable and unfair comparisons. To address this gap, we introduce the first MCP evaluation benchmark, MuseCPBench, which covers four categories of musical facets and enables comprehensive comparisons across five representative music editing baselines. Through systematic analysis along musical facets, methods, and models, we identify consistent preservation gaps in current music editing methods and provide insightful explanations. We hope our findings offer practical guidance for developing more effective and reliable music editing strategies with strong MCP capability</description><author>Yash Vishe, Eric Xue, Xunyi Jiang, Zachary Novack, Junda Wu, Julian McAuley, Xin Xu</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:44:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14629v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning the score under shape constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14624v1</link><description>Score estimation has recently emerged as a key modern statistical challenge, due to its pivotal role in generative modelling via diffusion models. Moreover, it is an essential ingredient in a new approach to linear regression via convex $M$-estimation, where the corresponding error densities are projected onto the log-concave class. Motivated by these applications, we study the minimax risk of score estimation with respect to squared $L^2(P_0)$-loss, where $P_0$ denotes an underlying log-concave distribution on $\mathbb{R}$. Such distributions have decreasing score functions, but on its own, this shape constraint is insufficient to guarantee a finite minimax risk. We therefore define subclasses of log-concave densities that capture two fundamental aspects of the estimation problem. First, we establish the crucial impact of tail behaviour on score estimation by determining the minimax rate over a class of log-concave densities whose score function exhibits controlled growth relative to the quantile levels. Second, we explore the interplay between smoothness and log-concavity by considering the class of log-concave densities with a scale restriction and a $(β,L)$-Hölder assumption on the log-density for some $β\in [1,2]$. We show that the minimax risk over this latter class is of order $L^{2/(2β+1)}n^{-β/(2β+1)}$ up to poly-logarithmic factors, where $n$ denotes the sample size. When $β&lt; 2$, this rate is faster than could be obtained under either the shape constraint or the smoothness assumption alone. Our upper bounds are attained by a locally adaptive, multiscale estimator constructed from a uniform confidence band for the score function. This study highlights intriguing differences between the score estimation and density estimation problems over this shape-constrained class.</description><author>Rebecca M. Lewis, Oliver Y.

While this approach has shown promising results for image data, extending dataset distillation methods to video data has proven challenging and often leads to suboptimal performance. In this work, we first identify the core challenge in video set distillation as the substantial increase in learnable parameters introduced by the temporal dimension of video, which complicates optimization and hinders convergence. To address this issue, we observe that a single frame is often sufficient to capture the discriminative semantics of a video. Leveraging this insight, we propose Single-Frame Video set Distillation (SFVD), a framework that distills videos into highly informative frames for each class. Using differentiable interpolation, these frames are transformed into video sequences and matched with the original dataset, while updates are restricted to the frames themselves for improved optimization efficiency. To further incorporate temporal information, the distilled frames are combined with sampled real videos from real videos during the matching process through a channel reshaping layer. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SFVD substantially outperforms prior methods, achieving improvements of up to 5.3% on MiniUCF, thereby offering a more effective solution.</description><author>Zhenghao Zhao, Haoxuan Wang, Kai Wang, Yuzhang Shang, Yuan Hong, Yan Yan</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:33:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14621v1</guid></item><item><title>JMMMU-Pro: Image-based Japanese Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark via Vibe Benchmark Construction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14620v1</link><description>This paper introduces JMMMU-Pro, an image-based Japanese Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark, and Vibe Benchmark Construction, a scalable construction method. Following the evolution from MMMU to MMMU-Pro, JMMMU-Pro extends JMMMU by composing the question image and question text into a single image, thereby creating a benchmark that requires integrated visual-textual understanding through visual perception. To build JMMMU-Pro, we propose Vibe Benchmark Construction, a methodology in which an image generative model (e.g., Nano Banana Pro) produces candidate visual questions, and humans verify the outputs and, when necessary, regenerate with adjusted prompts to ensure quality. By leveraging Nano Banana Pro's highly realistic image generation capabilities and its ability to embed clean Japanese text, we construct a high-quality benchmark at low cost, covering a wide range of background and layout designs. Experimental results show that all open-source LMMs struggle substantially with JMMMU-Pro, underscoring JMMMU-Pro as an important benchmark for guiding future efforts in the open-source community. We believe that JMMMU-Pro provides a more rigorous evaluation tool for assessing the Japanese capabilities of LMMs and that our Vibe Benchmark Construction also offers an efficient guideline for future development of image-based VQA benchmarks.</description><author>Atsuyuki Miyai, Shota Onohara, Jeonghun Baek, Kiyoharu Aizawa</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:33:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14620v1</guid></item><item><title>ParaFormer: A Generalized PageRank Graph Transformer for Graph Representation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14619v1</link><description>Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a promising graph learning tool, leveraging their all-pair connected property to effectively capture global information. To address the over-smoothing problem in deep GNNs, global attention was initially introduced, eliminating the necessity for using deep GNNs. However, through empirical and theoretical analysis, we verify that the introduced global attention exhibits severe over-smoothing, causing node representations to become indistinguishable due to its inherent low-pass filtering. This effect is even stronger than that observed in GNNs. To mitigate this, we propose PageRank Transformer (ParaFormer), which features a PageRank-enhanced attention module designed to mimic the behavior of deep Transformers. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that ParaFormer mitigates over-smoothing by functioning as an adaptive-pass filter. Experiments show that ParaFormer achieves consistent performance improvements across both node classification and graph classification tasks on 11 datasets ranging from thousands to millions of nodes, validating its efficacy.

Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are not suitable for such tasks, while RL with non-Markovian reward decision processes (NMRDPs) enables agents to tackle temporal-dependency tasks. This approach has long been known to lack formal guarantees on both (near-)optimality and sample efficiency. We contribute to solving both issues with QR-MAX, a novel model-based algorithm for discrete NMRDPs that factorizes Markovian transition learning from non-Markovian reward handling via reward machines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model-based RL algorithm for discrete-action NMRDPs that exploits this factorization to obtain PAC convergence to $\varepsilon$-optimal policies with polynomial sample complexity. We then extend QR-MAX to continuous state spaces with Bucket-QR-MAX, a SimHash-based discretiser that preserves the same factorized structure and achieves fast and stable learning without manual gridding or function approximation. We experimentally compare our method with modern state-of-the-art model-based RL approaches on environments of increasing complexity, showing a significant improvement in sample efficiency and increased robustness in finding optimal policies.</description><author>Alessandro Trapasso, Luca Iocchi, Fabio Patrizi</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:26:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14617v1</guid></item><item><title>Unitless Unrestricted Markov-Consistent SCM Generation: Better Benchmark Datasets for Causal Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17037v3</link><description>Causal discovery aims to extract qualitative causal knowledge in the form of causal graphs from data. Because causal ground truth is rarely known in the real world, simulated data plays a vital role in evaluating the performance of the various causal discovery algorithms proposed in the literature. But recent work highlighted certain artifacts of commonly used data generation techniques for a standard class of structural causal models (SCM) that may be nonphysical, including var- and R2-sortability, where the variables' variance and coefficients of determination (R2) after regressing on all other variables, respectively, increase along the causal order. Some causal methods exploit such artifacts, leading to unrealistic expectations for their performance on real-world data. Some modifications have been proposed to remove these artifacts; notably, the internally-standardized structural causal model (iSCM) avoids varsortability and largely alleviates R2-sortability on sparse causal graphs, but exhibits a reversed R2-sortability pattern for denser graphs not featured in their work. We analyze which sortability patterns we expect to see in real data, and propose a method for drawing coefficients that we argue more effectively samples the space of SCMs. Finally, we propose a novel extension of our SCM generation method to the time series setting.</description><author>Rebecca J.

We also prove that OW-HNPV is mathematically stable. It behaves in a controlled, predictable way, even when comparing persistence diagrams from networks with different feature types. Applied to Ethereum transaction networks (May 2017-May 2018), OW-HNPV demonstrates superior performance for cryptocurrency anomaly detection, achieving up to 10.4% AUC gain over baseline models for 7-day price movement predictions. Compared with established methods, including Vector of Averaged Bettis (VAB), persistence landscapes, and persistence images, velocity-based summaries excel at medium- to long-range forecasting (4-7 days), with OW-HNPV providing the most consistent and stable performance across prediction horizons.

WorldPlay draws power from three key innovations. 1) We use a Dual Action Representation to enable robust action control in response to the user's keyboard and mouse inputs. 2) To enforce long-term consistency, our Reconstituted Context Memory dynamically rebuilds context from past frames and uses temporal reframing to keep geometrically important but long-past frames accessible, effectively alleviating memory attenuation. 3) We also propose Context Forcing, a novel distillation method designed for memory-aware model. Aligning memory context between the teacher and student preserves the student's capacity to use long-range information, enabling real-time speeds while preventing error drift.

While fleets collect petabytes of video logs, identifying rare safety-critical events (e.g., erratic jaywalking, construction diversions) remains a manual, cost-prohibitive process. Existing solutions rely on coarse metadata search, which lacks precision, or cloud-based VLMs, which are privacy-invasive and expensive. We introduce Semantic-Drive, a local-first, neuro-symbolic framework for semantic data mining. Our approach decouples perception into two stages: (1) Symbolic Grounding via a real-time open-vocabulary detector (YOLOE) to anchor attention, and (2) Cognitive Analysis via a Reasoning VLM that performs forensic scene analysis. To mitigate hallucination, we implement a "System 2" inference-time alignment strategy, utilizing a multi-model "Judge-Scout" consensus mechanism. Benchmarked on the nuScenes dataset against the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD-E2E) taxonomy, Semantic-Drive achieves a Recall of 0.966 (vs. 0.475 for CLIP) and reduces Risk Assessment Error by 40% ccompared to the best single scout models.

These complex textual data sets have immense potential to inform future policy and targeted recommendations. However, because SL text data lack dedicated methods and are noisy, heterogeneous, and prone to anomalies, detecting and inferring key patterns is challenging. We introduce LLmFPCA-detect, a flexible framework that pairs LLM-based text embeddings with functional data analysis to detect clusters and infer anomalies in large SL text datasets. First, LLmFPCA-detect embeds each piece of text into an application-specific numeric space using LLM prompts. Sparse multivariate functional principal component analysis (mFPCA) conducted in the numeric space forms the workhorse to recover primary population characteristics, and produces subject-level scores which, together with baseline static covariates, facilitate data segmentation, unsupervised anomaly detection and inference, and enable other downstream tasks. In particular, we leverage LLMs to perform dynamic keyword profiling guided by the data segments and anomalies discovered by LLmFPCA-detect, and we show that cluster-specific functional PC scores from LLmFPCA-detect, used as features in existing pipelines, help boost prediction performance. We support the stability of LLmFPCA-detect with experiments and evaluate it on two different applications using public datasets, Amazon customer-review trajectories, and Wikipedia talk-page comment streams, demonstrating utility across domains and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</description><author>Prasanjit Dubey, Aritra Guha, Zhengyi Zhou, Qiong Wu, Xiaoming Huo, Paromita Dubey</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:14:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14604v1</guid></item><item><title>Sound and Music Biases in Deep Music Transcription Models: A Systematic Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14602v1</link><description>Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) -- the task of converting music audio into note representations -- has seen rapid progress, driven largely by deep learning systems. Due to the limited availability of richly annotated music datasets, much of the progress in AMT has been concentrated on classical piano music, and even a few very specific datasets. Whether these systems can generalize effectively to other musical contexts remains an open question. Complementing recent studies on distribution shifts in sound (e.g., recording conditions), in this work we investigate the musical dimension -- specifically, variations in genre, dynamics, and polyphony levels. To this end, we introduce the MDS corpus, comprising three distinct subsets -- (1) Genre, (2) Random, and (3) MAEtest -- to emulate different axes of distribution shift. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art AMT systems on the MDS corpus using both traditional information-retrieval and musically-informed performance metrics. Our extensive evaluation isolates and exposes varying degrees of performance degradation under specific distribution shifts. In particular, we measure a note-level F1 performance drop of 20 percentage points due to sound, and 14 due to genre. Generally, we find that dynamics estimation proves more vulnerable to musical variation than onset prediction. Musically informed evaluation metrics, particularly those capturing harmonic structure, help identify potential contributing factors. Furthermore, experiments with randomly generated, non-musical sequences reveal clear limitations in system performance under extreme musical distribution shifts. Altogether, these findings offer new evidence of the persistent impact of the Corpus Bias problem in deep AMT systems.</description><author>Lukáš Samuel Marták, Patricia Hu, Gerhard Widmer</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:12:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14602v1</guid></item><item><title>FakeRadar: Probing Forgery Outliers to Detect Unknown Deepfake Videos</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14601v1</link><description>In this paper, we propose FakeRadar, a novel deepfake video detection framework designed to address the challenges of cross-domain generalization in real-world scenarios. Existing detection methods typically rely on manipulation-specific cues, performing well on known forgery types but exhibiting severe limitations against emerging manipulation techniques. This poor generalization stems from their inability to adapt effectively to unseen forgery patterns. To overcome this, we leverage large-scale pretrained models (e.g. CLIP) to proactively probe the feature space, explicitly highlighting distributional gaps between real videos, known forgeries, and unseen manipulations. Specifically, FakeRadar introduces Forgery Outlier Probing, which employs dynamic subcluster modeling and cluster-conditional outlier generation to synthesize outlier samples near boundaries of estimated subclusters, simulating novel forgery artifacts beyond known manipulation types. Additionally, we design Outlier-Guided Tri-Training, which optimizes the detector to distinguish real, fake, and outlier samples using proposed outlier-driven contrastive learning and outlier-conditioned cross-entropy losses. Experiments show that FakeRadar outperforms existing methods across various benchmark datasets for deepfake video detection, particularly in cross-domain evaluations, by handling the variety of emerging manipulation techniques.</description><author>Zhaolun Li, Jichang Li, Yinqi Cai, Junye Chen, Xiaonan Luo, Guanbin Li, Rushi Lan</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:11:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14601v1</guid></item><item><title>Generalization performance of narrow one-hidden layer networks in the teacher-student setting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00629v3</link><description>Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. with a large number of hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of summary statistics. In doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or full-batch gradient descent.</description><author>Jean Barbier, Federica Gerace, Alessandro Ingrosso, Clarissa Lauditi, Enrico M.

Although numerous models for daily river discharge prediction exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major challenge. We address this with a novel method, HYdrological Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER). Our approach applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 47 "uncalibrated" catchment-based conceptual hydrological models. A reservoir computing (RC) model, a type of machine learning model, is then trained via linear regression to correct BMA output errors, a non-iterative process ensuring computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the required BMA and RC weights by mapping them to catchment attributes from gauged basins, creating a generalizable framework. Evaluated on 87 Japanese basins, in a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency, NSE, of 0.59) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (NSE 0.64) but required only 3 % of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (where only ~20 % of basins are gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (NSE 0.51) by leveraging the physical structure of the ensemble. In contrast, the LSTM's performance degraded substantially (NSE -0.61) due to data insufficiency. These results demonstrate that calibrating individual conceptual hydrological models is unnecessary when using a sufficiently large ensemble that is assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge prediction, particularly in ungauged basins. By eliminating basin-specific calibration, HYPER offers a scalable, interpretable framework for accurate hydrological prediction in diverse data-scarce regions.</description><author>Mizuki Funato, Yohei Sawada</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:07:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18423v2</guid></item><item><title>Hybrid Iterative Solvers with Geometry-Aware Neural Preconditioners for Parametric PDEs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14596v1</link><description>The convergence behavior of classical iterative solvers for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) is often highly sensitive to the domain and specific discretization of PDEs.

Moreover, using a simple survival follow-up label is insufficient to supervise such a complex task. To address these challenges, we propose KEMM, an LLM-driven Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Model for cancer survival prediction, which integrates expert reports and prognostic background knowledge. 1) Expert reports, provided by pathologists on a case-by-case basis and refined by large language model (LLM), offer succinct and clinically focused diagnostic statements. This information may typically suggest different survival outcomes. 2) Prognostic background knowledge (PBK), generated concisely by LLM, provides valuable prognostic background knowledge on different cancer types, which also enhances survival prediction. To leverage these knowledge, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced cross-modal (KECM) attention module. KECM can effectively guide the network to focus on discriminative and survival-relevant features from highly redundant modalities.

However, these techniques face scalability challenges for high-dimensional systems, as they rely on state-space discretization which grows exponentially with dimension. Learning-based approaches to dimensionality reduction, utilizing neural networks and autoencoders, have shown great potential to alleviate this problem. However, ensuring the correctness of the resulting verification results remains an open question. In this work, we provide a formal approach to reduce the dimensionality of systems via convex autoencoders and learn the dynamics in the latent space through a kernel-based method. We then construct a finite abstraction from the learned model in the latent space and guarantee that the abstraction contains the true behaviors of the original system. We show that the verification results in the latent space can be mapped back to the original system. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple systems, including a 26D system controlled by a neural network, showing significant scalability improvements without loss of rigor.</description><author>Robert Reed, Luca Laurenti, Morteza Lahijanian</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:58:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13593v2</guid></item><item><title>Using Socio-economic Indicators, Smart Transit Systems, and Urban Simulator to Accelerate ZEV Adoption and Reduce VMT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11870v2</link><description>Globally, on-road transportation accounts for 15% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and an estimated 385,000 premature deaths from PM2.5. Cities play a critical role in meeting IPCC targets, generating 75% of global energy-related GHG emissions. In Houston, Texas, on-road transportation represents 48% of baseline emissions in the Climate Action Plan (CAP). To reach net-zero by 2050, the CAP targets a 70% emissions reduction from a 2014 baseline, offset by 30% renewable energy. This goal is challenging because Houston is low-density and auto-dependent, with 89% of on-road emissions from cars and small trucks and limited public transit usage. Socio-economic disparities further constrain Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) adoption. Strategies focus on expanding ZEV access and reducing Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by 20% through transit improvements and city design. This paper presents methods for establishing an on-road emissions baseline and evaluating policies that leverage socio-economic indicators and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to accelerate ZEV adoption and reduce VMT. Smart parking, transit incentives, secure data systems, and ZEV fleet management support improvements in modal split and system reliability. Policy options are analyzed and potential actions identified. To support evaluation, a simulation environment was developed in Unity 3D, enabling dynamic modeling of urban mobility and visualization of policy scenarios. Auto-dependent cities aiming for 2050 emission targets can benefit from the indicators, metrics, and technologies discussed.</description><author>Mulham Fawakherji, Bruce Race, Driss Benhaddou</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:55:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11870v2</guid></item><item><title>Listening Between the Lines: Decoding Podcast Narratives with Language Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05310v2</link><description>Podcasts have become a central arena for shaping public opinion, making them a vital source for understanding contemporary discourse. Their typically unscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex form of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine their narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ. The fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant challenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models, typically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to capture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative frames. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing podcast narratives at scale. To solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the conversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our approach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with high-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions of this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely aligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new analysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being discussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a more robust framework for studying influence in digital media.</description><author>Shreya Gupta, Ojasva Saxena, Arghodeep Nandi, Sarah Masud, Kiran Garimella, Tanmoy Chakraborty</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:54:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05310v2</guid></item><item><title>Towards Nepali-language LLMs: Efficient GPT training with a Nepali BPE tokenizer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14585v1</link><description>Nepali, a low-resource language spoken by over 32 million people, continues to face challenges in natural language processing (NLP) due to its complex grammar, agglutinative morphology, and limited availability of high-quality corpora. Most efforts to date have centered on basic encoder architectures; they remain insufficient for Nepali-specific text generation. This study presents a GPT-2-based Nepali language model trained using several training strategies inspired by GPT-3, including optimized learning rate schedules, batch scaling, and architectural refinements. A custom 16k Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer was trained exclusively on Nepali text to ensure more consistent segmentation and improved input representation. The model was pretrained on a combined dataset comprising a 10.75GB cleaned NepBERTa corpus and additional web-scraped Nepali news articles. FlashAttention was integrated to reduce memory usage and stabilize training. After two epochs, the model achieved a training loss of 3.168177, a validation loss of 3.081982, and a final perplexity of 21.80, demonstrating its capability to generate coherent Nepali news-style text.</description><author>Adarsha Shrestha, Basanta Pokharel, Binit Shrestha, Smriti Adhikari, Dinesh Gothe</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:53:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14585v1</guid></item><item><title>Semiparametric inference for impulse response functions using double/debiased machine learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10009v2</link><description>We introduce a double/debiased machine learning estimator for the impulse response function in settings where a time series of interest is subjected to multiple discrete treatments, assigned over time, which can have a causal effect on future outcomes. The proposed estimator can rely on fully nonparametric relations between treatment and outcome variables, opening up the possibility to use flexible machine learning approaches to estimate impulse response functions. To this end, we extend the theory of double machine learning from an i.i.d. to a time series setting and show that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed at the parametric rate, allowing for semiparametric inference for dynamic effects in a time series setting. The properties of the estimator are validated numerically in finite samples by applying it to learn the impulse response function in the presence of serial dependence in both the confounder and observation innovation processes. We also illustrate the methodology empirically by applying it to the estimation of the effects of macroeconomic shocks.</description><author>Daniele Ballinari, Alexander Wehrli</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:51:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10009v2</guid></item><item><title>Low-Resource, High-Impact: Building Corpora for Inclusive Language Technologies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14576v1</link><description>This tutorial (https://tum-nlp.github.io/low-resource-tutorial) is designed for NLP practitioners, researchers, and developers working with multilingual and low-resource languages who seek to create more equitable and socially impactful language technologies.

However, most publicly available datasets for training such models rely on web-crawled images, which often differ from users' real-world meal photos. In this work, we present FoodLogAthl-218, a food image dataset constructed from real-world meal records collected through the dietary management application FoodLog Athl. The dataset contains 6,925 images across 218 food categories, with a total of 14,349 bounding boxes. Rich metadata, including meal date and time, anonymized user IDs, and meal-level context, accompany each image. Unlike conventional datasets-where a predefined class set guides web-based image collection-our data begins with user-submitted photos, and labels are applied afterward. This yields greater intra-class diversity, a natural frequency distribution of meal types, and casual, unfiltered images intended for personal use rather than public sharing. In addition to (1) a standard classification benchmark, we introduce two FoodLog-specific tasks: (2) an incremental fine-tuning protocol that follows the temporal stream of users' logs, and (3) a context-aware classification task where each image contains multiple dishes, and the model must classify each dish by leveraging the overall meal context. We evaluate these tasks using large multimodal models (LMMs).

To address this gap, we introduce OpenVE-3M, an open-source, large-scale, and high-quality dataset for instruction-based video editing. It comprises two primary categories: spatially-aligned edits (Global Style, Background Change, Local Change, Local Remove, Local Add, and Subtitles Edit) and non-spatially-aligned edits (Camera Multi-Shot Edit and Creative Edit). All edit types are generated via a meticulously designed data pipeline with rigorous quality filtering. OpenVE-3M surpasses existing open-source datasets in terms of scale, diversity of edit types, instruction length, and overall quality. Furthermore, to address the lack of a unified benchmark in the field, we construct OpenVE-Bench, containing 431 video-edit pairs that cover a diverse range of editing tasks with three key metrics highly aligned with human judgment. We present OpenVE-Edit, a 5B model trained on our dataset that demonstrates remarkable efficiency and effectiveness by setting a new state-of-the-art on OpenVE-Bench, outperforming all prior open-source models including a 14B baseline.

While recent efforts have begun to equip FMs with native single-agent abilities -- such as GUI interaction or integrated tool use -- we argue that the next frontier is endowing FMs with native multi-agent intelligence. We identify four core capabilities of FMs in multi-agent contexts: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. Contrary to assumptions about the spontaneous emergence of such abilities, we provide extensive empirical evidence, across 41 large language models and 7 challenging benchmarks, showing that scaling single-agent performance alone does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence. To address this gap, we outline key research directions -- spanning dataset construction, evaluation, training paradigms, and safety considerations -- for building FMs with native multi-agent intelligence.</description><author>Shuyue Hu, Haoyang Yan, Yiqun Zhang, Yang Chen, Dongzhan Zhou, Lei Bai</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:37:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08743v3</guid></item><item><title>Residual GRU+MHSA: A Lightweight Hybrid Recurrent Attention Model for Cardiovascular Disease Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14563v1</link><description>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for reliable and efficient predictive tools that support early intervention. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on handcrafted features and clinician expertise, while machine learning methods improve reproducibility but often struggle to generalize across noisy and heterogeneous clinical data. In this work, we propose Residual GRU with Multi-Head Self-Attention, a compact deep learning architecture designed for tabular clinical records. The model integrates residual bidirectional gated recurrent units for sequential modeling of feature columns, a channel reweighting block, and multi-head self-attention pooling with a learnable classification token to capture global context. We evaluate the model on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 5-fold stratified cross-validation and compare it against classical methods such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, as well as modern deep learning baselines including DeepMLP, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and Transformers. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.861, macro-F1 of 0.860, ROC-AUC of 0.908, and PR-AUC of 0.904, outperforming all baselines. Ablation studies confirm the individual contributions of residual recurrence, channel gating, and attention pooling. t-SNE visualizations further indicate that the learned embeddings exhibit clearer separation between disease and non-disease classes compared to raw features. These results demonstrate that lightweight hybrid recurrent and attention-based architectures provide a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency for clinical risk prediction, supporting deployment in resource-constrained healthcare settings.</description><author>Tejaswani Dash, Gautam Datla, Anudeep Vurity, Tazeem Ahmad, Mohd Adnan, Saima Rafi, Saisha Patro, Saina Patro</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:33:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14563v1</guid></item><item><title>Polypersona: Persona-Grounded LLM for Synthetic Survey Responses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14562v1</link><description>This paper introduces PolyPersona, a generative framework for synthesizing persona-conditioned survey responses across multiple domains.

A dialogue-based data pipeline explicitly preserves persona cues, ensuring consistent behavioral alignment across generated responses. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of 3,568 synthetic survey responses spanning ten domains and 433 distinct personas, enabling controlled instruction tuning and systematic multi-domain evaluation. We evaluate the generated responses using a multi-metric evaluation suite that combines standard text generation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, with survey-specific metrics designed to assess structural coherence, stylistic consistency, and sentiment alignment.Experimental results show that compact models such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Phi-2 achieve performance comparable to larger 7B to 8B baselines, with a highest BLEU score of 0.090 and ROUGE-1 of 0.429. These findings demonstrate that persona-conditioned fine-tuning enables small language models to generate reliable and coherent synthetic survey data.

Existing methods predominantly rely on learning robust global representations or implicit feature alignment, which often fail to model explicit spatial correspondences crucial for accurate localization. In this work, we propose a novel correspondence-aware feature refinement framework, termed CLNet, that explicitly bridges the semantic and geometric gaps between different views. CLNet decomposes the view alignment process into three learnable and complementary modules: a Neural Correspondence Map (NCM) that spatially aligns cross-view features via latent correspondence fields; a Nonlinear Embedding Converter (NEC) that remaps features across perspectives using an MLP-based transformation; and a Global Feature Recalibration (GFR) module that reweights informative feature channels guided by learned spatial cues. The proposed CLNet can jointly capture both high-level semantics and fine-grained alignments. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks, CVUSA, CVACT, VIGOR, and University-1652, demonstrate that our proposed CLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering better interpretability and generalizability.</description><author>Xianwei Cao, Dou Quan, Shuang Wang, Ning Huyan, Wei Wang, Yunan Li, Licheng Jiao</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:31:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14560v1</guid></item><item><title>Counterfactual Explanations for Time Series Should be Human-Centered and Temporally Coherent in Interventions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14559v1</link><description>Counterfactual explanations are increasingly proposed as interpretable mechanisms to achieve algorithmic recourse. However, current counterfactual techniques for time series classification are predominantly designed with static data assumptions and focus on generating minimal input perturbations to flip model predictions. This paper argues that such approaches are fundamentally insufficient in clinical recommendation settings, where interventions unfold over time and must be causally plausible and temporally coherent. We advocate for a shift towards counterfactuals that reflect sustained, goal-directed interventions aligned with clinical reasoning and patient-specific dynamics. We identify critical gaps in existing methods that limit their practical applicability, specifically, temporal blind spots and the lack of user-centered considerations in both method design and evaluation metrics. To support our position, we conduct a robustness analysis of several state-of-the-art methods for time series and show that the generated counterfactuals are highly sensitive to stochastic noise. This finding highlights their limited reliability in real-world clinical settings, where minor measurement variations are inevitable. We conclude by calling for methods and evaluation frameworks that go beyond mere prediction changes without considering feasibility or actionability. We emphasize the need for actionable, purpose-driven interventions that are feasible in real-world contexts for the users of such applications.</description><author>Emmanuel C. Chukwu, Rianne M.

Among existing techniques, non-rigid registration (NRR) is particularly challenging due to the need to capture complex anatomical deformations caused by physiological processes like respiration or contrast-induced signal variations. Traditional NRR methods, while theoretically robust, often require extensive parameter tuning and incur high computational costs, limiting their use in real-time clinical workflows. Recent deep learning (DL)-based approaches have shown promise; however, their dependence on task-specific retraining restricts scalability and adaptability in practice. These limitations underscore the need for efficient, generalizable registration frameworks capable of handling heterogeneous imaging contexts. In this work, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for 3D non-rigid registration that generalizes across multiple imaging modalities and anatomical regions. Unlike conventional methods that rely on application-specific models, our approach eliminates anatomy- or modality-specific customization, enabling streamlined integration into diverse clinical environments.</description><author>Sneha Sree C., Dattesh Shanbhag, Sudhanya Chatterjee</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:29:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14556v1</guid></item><item><title>VLegal-Bench: Cognitively Grounded Benchmark for Vietnamese Legal Reasoning of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14554v1</link><description>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new possibilities for applying artificial intelligence within the legal domain.

The benchmark comprises 10,450 samples generated through a rigorous annotation pipeline, where legal experts label and cross-validate each instance using our annotation system to ensure every sample is grounded in authoritative legal documents and mirrors real-world legal assistant workflows, including general legal questions and answers, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, and scenario-based problem solving tailored to Vietnamese law. By providing a standardized, transparent, and cognitively informed evaluation framework, VLegal-Bench establishes a solid foundation for assessing LLM performance in Vietnamese legal contexts and supports the development of more reliable, interpretable, and ethically aligned AI-assisted legal systems.</description><author>Nguyen Tien Dong, Minh-Anh Nguyen, Thanh Dat Hoang, Nguyen Tuan Ngoc, Dao Xuan Quang Minh, Phan Phi Hai, Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh, Dang Van Tu, Binh Vu</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:28:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14554v1</guid></item><item><title>TAT: Task-Adaptive Transformer for All-in-One Medical Image Restoration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14550v1</link><description>Medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to recover high-quality medical images from their low-quality counterparts. Recent advancements in MedIR have focused on All-in-One models capable of simultaneously addressing multiple different MedIR tasks. However, due to significant differences in both modality and degradation types, using a shared model for these diverse tasks requires careful consideration of two critical inter-task relationships: task interference, which occurs when conflicting gradient update directions arise across tasks on the same parameter, and task imbalance, which refers to uneven optimization caused by varying learning difficulties inherent to each task. To address these challenges, we propose a task-adaptive Transformer (TAT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts to different tasks through two key innovations. First, a task-adaptive weight generation strategy is introduced to mitigate task interference by generating task-specific weight parameters for each task, thereby eliminating potential gradient conflicts on shared weight parameters. Second, a task-adaptive loss balancing strategy is introduced to dynamically adjust loss weights based on task-specific learning difficulties, preventing task domination or undertraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed TAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks--PET synthesis, CT denoising, and MRI super-resolution--both in task-specific and All-in-One settings.

Autoregressive modeling has been a popular approach, partly because of its training efficiency; however, that comes at the cost of sensitivity to overfitting. On the other hand, masked-diffusion models are less efficient to train while being more resilient to overfitting. In this work, we demonstrate that dual-objective training achieves the best of both worlds. To derive the optimal ratio between both objectives, we train and evaluate 50 language models under varying levels of data repetition. We show that it is optimal to combine both objectives under all evaluated settings and that the optimal ratio is similar whether targeting autoregressive or masked-diffusion downstream performance.</description><author>David Samuel, Lucas Georges Gabriel Charpentier</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:25:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14549v1</guid></item><item><title>Tensor Product Attention Is All You Need</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06425v6</link><description>Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, substantially shrinking the KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components and seamlessly integrating with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation on language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 surpasses or matches the performance of standard Transformer baselines including Multi-Head Attention (MHA), Multi-Query Attention (MQA), Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of established evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency and computational efficiency at decoding stage enables processing longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

However, when using multiple reference images from the same ID, existing methods typically produce lower-fidelity portraits and struggle to customize face attributes precisely. To address these issues, this paper presents HiFi-Portrait, a high-fidelity method for zero-shot portrait generation. Specifically, we first introduce the face refiner and landmark generator to obtain fine-grained multi-face features and 3D-aware face landmarks. The landmarks include the reference ID and the target attributes. Then, we design HiFi-Net to fuse multi-face features and align them with landmarks, which improves ID fidelity and face control. In addition, we devise an automated pipeline to construct an ID-based dataset for training HiFi-Portrait. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA approaches in face similarity and controllability. Furthermore, our method is also compatible with previous SDXL-based works.</description><author>Yifang Xu, Benxiang Zhai, Yunzhuo Sun, Ming Li, Yang Li, Sidan Du</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:17:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14542v1</guid></item><item><title>CAPRMIL: Context-Aware Patch Representations for Multiple Instance Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14540v1</link><description>In computational pathology, weak supervision has become the standard for deep learning due to the gigapixel scale of WSIs and the scarcity of pixel-level annotations, with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) established as the principal framework for slide-level model training. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting for MIL methods, inspired by proceedings in Neural Partial Differential Equation (PDE) Solvers. Instead of relying on complex attention-based aggregation, we propose an efficient, aggregator-agnostic framework that removes the complexity of correlation learning from the MIL aggregator. CAPRMIL produces rich context-aware patch embeddings that promote effective correlation learning on downstream tasks. By projecting patch features -- extracted using a frozen patch encoder -- into a small set of global context/morphology-aware tokens and utilizing multi-head self-attention, CAPRMIL injects global context with linear computational complexity with respect to the bag size. Paired with a simple Mean MIL aggregator, CAPRMIL matches state-of-the-art slide-level performance across multiple public pathology benchmarks, while reducing the total number of trainable parameters by 48%-92.8% versus SOTA MILs, lowering FLOPs during inference by 52%-99%, and ranking among the best models on GPU memory efficiency and training time. Our results indicate that learning rich, context-aware instance representations before aggregation is an effective and scalable alternative to complex pooling for whole-slide analysis.

Noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) combined with deep learning (DL) approaches for estimating intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) from body surface potentials (BSPMs) has shown promise, but progress is hindered by the limited availability of paired BSPM-EGM datasets. To address this limitation, we investigate variational autoencoders (VAEs) for the generation of synthetic multichannel atrial EGMs. Two models are proposed: a sinus rhythm-specific VAE (VAE-S) and a class-conditioned VAE (VAE-C) trained on both sinus rhythm and AF signals. Generated EGMs are evaluated using morphological, spectral, and distributional similarity metrics. VAE-S achieves higher fidelity with respect to in silico EGMs, while VAE-C enables rhythm-specific generation at the expense of reduced sinus reconstruction quality. As a proof of concept, the generated EGMs are used for data augmentation in a downstream noninvasive EGM reconstruction task, where moderate augmentation improves estimation performance. These results demonstrate the potential of VAE-based generative modeling to alleviate data scarcity and enhance deep learning-based ECGI pipelines.</description><author>Miriam Gutiérrez Fernández, Karen López-Linares, Carlos Fambuena Santos, María S.

However, its performance deteriorates markedly at night due to low visibility and varying illumination, e.g., insufficient light causes textureless areas, and moving objects bring blurry regions. To this end, we propose a self-supervised framework named DASP that leverages spatiotemporal priors for nighttime depth estimation. Specifically, DASP consists of an adversarial branch for extracting spatiotemporal priors and a self-supervised branch for learning. In the adversarial branch, we first design an adversarial network where the discriminator is composed of four devised spatiotemporal priors learning blocks (SPLB) to exploit the daytime priors. In particular, the SPLB contains a spatial-based temporal learning module (STLM) that uses orthogonal differencing to extract motion-related variations along the time axis and an axial spatial learning module (ASLM) that adopts local asymmetric convolutions with global axial attention to capture the multiscale structural information. By combining STLM and ASLM, our model can acquire sufficient spatiotemporal features to restore textureless areas and estimate the blurry regions caused by dynamic objects. In the self-supervised branch, we propose a 3D consistency projection loss to bilaterally project the target frame and source frame into a shared 3D space, and calculate the 3D discrepancy between the two projected frames as a loss to optimize the 3D structural consistency and daytime priors. Extensive experiments on the Oxford RobotCar and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for nighttime depth estimation. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.</description><author>Yiheng Huang, Junhong Chen, Anqi Ning, Zhanhong Liang, Nick Michiels, Luc Claesen, Wenyin Liu</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:11:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14536v1</guid></item><item><title>VersatileFFN: Achieving Parameter Efficiency in LLMs via Adaptive Wide-and-Deep Reuse</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14531v1</link><description>The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance, but it also leads to prohibitive memory costs. Existing parameter-efficient approaches such as pruning and quantization mainly compress pretrained models without enhancing architectural capacity, thereby hitting the representational ceiling of the base model. In this work, we propose VersatileFFN, a novel feed-forward network (FFN) that enables flexible reuse of parameters in both width and depth dimensions within a fixed parameter budget. Inspired by the dual-process theory of cognition, VersatileFFN comprises two adaptive pathways: a width-versatile path that generates a mixture of sub-experts from a single shared FFN, mimicking sparse expert routing without increasing parameters, and a depth-versatile path that recursively applies the same FFN to emulate deeper processing for complex tokens. A difficulty-aware gating dynamically balances the two pathways, steering "easy" tokens through the efficient width-wise route and allocating deeper iterative refinement to "hard" tokens. Crucially, both pathways reuse the same parameters, so all additional capacity comes from computation rather than memory. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model scales demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

Unlike prior work that reconstructs only the human and treats objects as background, GASPACHO simultaneously recovers animatable templates for both the human and the interacting object as distinct sets of Gaussians, thereby allowing for controllable renderings of novel human object interactions in different poses from novel-camera viewpoints. We introduce a novel formulation that learns object Gaussians on an underlying 2D surface manifold rather than in 3D volume, yielding sharper, fine-grained object details for dynamic object reconstruction. We further propose a contact constraint in Gaussian space that regularizes human-object relations and enables natural, physically plausible animation. Across three benchmarks - BEHAVE, NeuralDome, and DNA-Rendering - GASPACHO achieves high-quality reconstructions under heavy occlusion and supports controllable synthesis of novel human-object interactions. We also demonstrate that our method allows for composition of humans and objects in 3D scenes and for the first time showcase that neural rendering can be used for the controllable generation of photoreal humans interacting with dynamic objects in diverse scenes.

This premature semantic collapse -- the tendency to collapse multiple valid interpretations into a single output -- stems from classical identity assumptions embedded in standard neural architectures. We propose Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a computational framework that treats ambiguity retention as a valid reasoning mode rather than a defect to be eliminated. NRR introduces three core principles: (1) Non-Identity (A $\ne$ A) -- the same symbol refers to different entities across contexts; (2) Approximate Identity (A $\approx$ A) -- entities share partial structural overlap without being identical; and (3) Non-Resolution -- conflicting interpretations can coexist without forced convergence. We formalize these principles through three architectural components: Multi-Vector Embeddings for context-dependent representation, Non-Collapsing Attention for parallel interpretation retention, and Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT) for maintaining A $\ne$ A across inference. We demonstrate NRR's advantages through case studies in paradox handling, creative generation, and context-dependent reasoning. Crucially, we provide a minimal empirical validation on a synthetic context-shift task where an NRR-lite model achieves 90.9% out-of-distribution accuracy compared to 9.1% for standard architectures, demonstrating that ambiguity preservation enables structural generalization. NRR challenges the assumption that meaning must collapse to be useful, offering a foundation for AI systems capable of sophisticated ambiguity handling and creative reasoning. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control.</description><author>Kei Saito</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:05:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13478v2</guid></item><item><title>Dynamic Learning Rate Scheduling based on Loss Changes Leads to Faster Convergence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14527v1</link><description>Despite significant advances in optimizers for training, most research works use common scheduler choices like Cosine or exponential decay.

The results show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art schedulers in terms of accuracy, speed, and convergence. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the GreedyLR algorithm, including a proof of convergence and derivation of the optimal scaling factor $F$ that maximizes the convergence rate, along with experiments to show robustness of the algorithm to realistic noisy landscapes. Our scheduler is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and could be considered a good default scheduler for training.</description><author>Shreyas Subramanian, Bala Krishnamoorthy, Pranav Murthy</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:03:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14527v1</guid></item><item><title>SIGMMA: Hierarchical Graph-Based Multi-Scale Multi-modal Contrastive Alignment of Histopathology Image and Spatial Transcriptome</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15464v3</link><description>Recent advances in computational pathology have leveraged vision-language models to learn joint representations of Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) images with spatial transcriptomic (ST) profiles. However, existing approaches typically align HE tiles with their corresponding ST profiles at a single scale, overlooking fine-grained cellular structures and their spatial organization. To address this, we propose Sigmma, a multi-modal contrastive alignment framework for learning hierarchical representations of HE images and spatial transcriptome profiles across multiple scales. Sigmma introduces multi-scale contrastive alignment, ensuring that representations learned at different scales remain coherent across modalities. Furthermore, by representing cell interactions as a graph and integrating inter- and intra-subgraph relationships, our approach effectively captures cell-cell interactions, ranging from fine to coarse, within the tissue microenvironment. We demonstrate that Sigmm learns representations that better capture cross-modal correspondences, leading to an improvement of avg. 9.78\% in the gene-expression prediction task and avg. 26.93\% in the cross-modal retrieval task across datasets. We further show that it learns meaningful multi-tissue organization in downstream analyses.</description><author>Dabin Jeong, Amirhossein Vahidi, Ciro Ramírez-Suástegui, Marie Moullet, Kevin Ly, Mohammad Vali Sanian, Sebastian Birk, Yinshui Chang, Adam Boxall, Daniyal Jafree, Lloyd Steele, Vijaya Baskar MS, Muzlifah Haniffa, Mohammad Lotfollahi</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:01:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15464v3</guid></item><item><title>Group-robust Machine Unlearning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09330v2</link><description>Machine unlearning is an emerging paradigm to remove the influence of specific training data (i.e., the forget set) from a model while preserving its knowledge of the rest of the data (i.e., the retain set). Previous approaches assume the forget data to be uniformly distributed from all training datapoints. However, if the data to unlearn is dominant in one group (e.g., ethnicity, gender), we empirically show that performance for this group degrades, leading to fairness issues. To perform unlearning while preserving fairness, this work addresses the overlooked problem of non-uniformly distributed forget sets, which we refer to as group-robust machine unlearning. We formalize the problem and present a simple and effective exact unlearning strategy that mitigates the performance loss in dominant groups via sample distribution reweighting. Moreover, we present MIU (Mutual Information-aware Machine Unlearning), the first approach for group robustness in approximate machine unlearning. MIU minimizes the mutual information between model features and group information, achieving unlearning while reducing performance degradation in the dominant group of the forget set. Additionally, MIU exploits sample distribution reweighting and mutual information calibration with the original model to preserve group robustness. We conduct experiments on three datasets and show that MIU outperforms standard methods, achieving unlearning without compromising model robustness.

By predicting performance early in the communication phase, potentially sluggish transfers can be identified and selectively monitored, optimizing network usage and overall performance. A key bottleneck to improving the predictive power of machine learning (ML) models in this context is the issue of class imbalance. This project focuses on addressing the class imbalance problem to enhance the accuracy of performance predictions. In this study, we analyze and compare various augmentation strategies, including traditional oversampling methods and generative techniques. Additionally, we adjust the class imbalance ratios in training datasets to evaluate their impact on model performance. While augmentation may improve performance, as the imbalance ratio increases, the performance does not significantly improve. We conclude that even the most advanced technique, such as CTGAN, does not significantly improve over simple stratified sampling.</description><author>Jacob Taegon Kim, Alex Sim, Kesheng Wu, Jinoh Kim</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:55:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14522v1</guid></item><item><title>Order Matters: 3D Shape Generation from Sequential VR Sketches</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04761v2</link><description>VR sketching lets users explore and iterate on ideas directly in 3D, offering a faster and more intuitive alternative to conventional CAD tools.

The standard approach for data-agnostic uncertainty quantification is to use conformal prediction (CP), a well-established framework to build uncertainty models with proven statistical guarantees that do not assume any shape for the error distribution of the surrogate model. However, since the classic statistical guarantee offered by CP is given in terms of bounds for the marginal coverage, for small calibration set sizes (which are frequent in realistic surrogate modelling that aims to quantify error at different regions), the potentially strong dispersion of the coverage distribution around its average negatively impacts the relevance of the uncertainty model's statistical guarantee, often obtaining coverages below the expected value, resulting in a less applicable framework. After providing a gentle presentation of uncertainty quantification for surrogate models for machine learning practitioners, in this paper we bridge the gap by proposing a new statistical guarantee that offers probabilistic information for the coverage of a single conformal predictor. We show that the proposed framework converges to the standard solution offered by CP for large calibration set sizes and, unlike the classic guarantee, still offers relevant information about the coverage of a conformal predictor for small data sizes. We validate the methodology in a suite of examples, and implement an open access software solution that can be used alongside common conformal prediction libraries to obtain uncertainty models that fulfil the new guarantee.</description><author>Miguel Sánchez-Domínguez, Lucas Lacasa, Javier de Vicente, Gonzalo Rubio, Eusebio Valero</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:50:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04566v2</guid></item><item><title>Exploring Network-Knowledge Graph Duality: A Case Study in Agentic Supply Chain Risk Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01115v2</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and network-native data underlying financial risk.

We treat the supply chain network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.</description><author>Evan Heus, Rick Bookstaber, Dhruv Sharma</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:50:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01115v2</guid></item><item><title>Online Multi-modal Root Cause Identification in Microservice Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10021v2</link><description>Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is essential for pinpointing the root causes of failures in microservice systems.

Many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the performance of such code translators. However, previous benchmarks mostly provide fine-grained samples, focusing at either code snippet, function, or file-level code translation. Such benchmarks do not accurately reflect real-world demands, where entire repositories often need to be translated, involving longer code length and more complex functionalities. To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, named RepoTransBench, which is a real-world multilingual repository-level code translation benchmark featuring 1,897 real-world repository samples across 13 language pairs with automatically executable test suites. Besides, we introduce RepoTransAgent, a general agent framework to perform repository-level code translation. We evaluate both our benchmark's challenges and agent's effectiveness using several methods and backbone LLMs, revealing that repository-level translation remains challenging, where the best-performing method achieves only a 32.8% success rate. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that translation difficulty varies significantly by language pair direction, with dynamic-to-static language translation being much more challenging than the reverse direction (achieving below 10% vs. static-to-dynamic at 45-63%). Finally, we conduct a detailed error analysis and highlight current LLMs' deficiencies in repository-level code translation, which could provide a reference for further improvements.

To address these challenges, we present RecGPT-V2 with four key innovations. First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage. Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%. Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%. Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance. Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge framework decomposes assessment into multi-step reasoning, improving human preference alignment.

Traditionally, quantitative researchers have studied causal effects at the level of variables; for example, how a certain drug dose (W) causally affects a patient's blood pressure (Y). However, in many modern data domains, the raw variables-such as pixels in an image or tokens in a language model-do not have the semantic structure needed to formulate meaningful causal questions. In this paper, we offer a more fine-grained perspective by studying causal effects at the level of events, drawing inspiration from probability theory, where core notions such as independence are first given for events and sigma-algebras, before random variables enter the picture. Within the measure-theoretic framework of causal spaces, a recently introduced axiomatisation of causality, we first introduce several binary definitions that determine whether a causal effect is present, as well as proving some properties of them linking causal effect to (in)dependence under an intervention measure. Further, we provide quantifying measures that capture the strength and nature of causal effects on events, and show that we can recover the common measures of treatment effect as special cases.</description><author>Junhyung Park, Yuqing Zhou</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:35:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11919v2</guid></item><item><title>Native Intelligence Emerges from Large-Scale Clinical Practice: A Retinal Foundation Model with Deployment Efficiency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14499v1</link><description>Current retinal foundation models remain constrained by curated research datasets that lack authentic clinical context, and require extensive task-specific optimization for each application, limiting their deployment efficiency in low-resource settings. Here, we show that these barriers can be overcome by building clinical native intelligence directly from real-world medical practice. Our key insight is that large-scale telemedicine programs, where expert centers provide remote consultations across distributed facilities, represent a natural reservoir for learning clinical image interpretation. We present ReVision, a retinal foundation model that learns from the natural alignment between 485,980 color fundus photographs and their corresponding diagnostic reports, accumulated through a decade-long telemedicine program spanning 162 medical institutions across China. Through extensive evaluation across 27 ophthalmic benchmarks, we demonstrate that ReVison enables deployment efficiency with minimal local resources. Without any task-specific training, ReVision achieves zero-shot disease detection with an average AUROC of 0.946 across 12 public benchmarks and 0.952 on 3 independent clinical cohorts. When minimal adaptation is feasible, ReVision matches extensively fine-tuned alternatives while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and labeled examples. The learned representations also transfer effectively to new clinical sites, imaging domains, imaging modalities, and systemic health prediction tasks. In a prospective reader study with 33 ophthalmologists, ReVision's zero-shot assistance improved diagnostic accuracy by 14.8% across all experience levels. These results demonstrate that clinical native intelligence can be directly extracted from clinical archives without any further annotation to build medical AI systems suited to various low-resource settings.</description><author>Jia Guo, Jiawei Du, Shengzhu Yang, Shuai Lu, Wenquan Cheng, Kaiwen Zhang, Yihua Sun, Chuhong Yang, Weihang Zhang, Fang Chen, Yilan Wu, Lie Ju, Guochen Ning, Longfei Ma, Huiping Yao, Jinyuan Wang, Peilun Shi, Yukun Zhou, Jie Xu, Pearse A.
