For geometry, both mesh and volumetric approaches havedifficulty modeling intricate structures like 3D hair geometry. For appearance,existing relighting models are limited in fidelity and often too slow to renderin real-time with high-resolution continuous environments. In this work, wepresent Relightable Gaussian Codec Avatars, a method to build high-fidelityrelightable head avatars that can be animated to generate novel expressions.Our geometry model based on 3D Gaussians can capture 3D-consistentsub-millimeter details such as hair strands and pores on dynamic facesequences. To support diverse materials of human heads such as the eyes, skin,and hair in a unified manner, we present a novel relightable appearance modelbased on learnable radiance transfer. Together with global illumination-awarespherical harmonics for the diffuse components, we achieve real-time relightingwith spatially all-frequency reflections using spherical Gaussians. Thisappearance model can be efficiently relit under both point light and continuousillumination. We further improve the fidelity of eye reflections and enableexplicit gaze control by introducing relightable explicit eye models. Ourmethod outperforms existing approaches without compromising real-timeperformance. We also demonstrate real-time relighting of avatars on a tetheredconsumer VR headset, showcasing the efficiency and fidelity of our avatars.</description><author>Shunsuke Saito, Gabriel Schwartz, Tomas Simon, Junxuan Li, Giljoo Nam</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 18:59:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03704v1</guid></item><item><title>Skeleton-in-Context: Unified Skeleton Sequence Modeling with In-Context Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03703v1</link><description>In-context learning provides a new perspective for multi-task modeling forvision and NLP. Under this setting, the model can perceive tasks from promptsand accomplish them without any extra task-specific head predictions or modelfine-tuning. However, Skeleton sequence modeling via in-context learningremains unexplored. Directly applying existing in-context models from otherareas onto skeleton sequences fails due to the inter-frame and cross-task posesimilarity that makes it outstandingly hard to perceive the task correctly froma subtle context. To address this challenge, we propose Skeleton-in-Context(SiC), an effective framework for in-context skeleton sequence modeling. OurSiC is able to handle multiple skeleton-based tasks simultaneously after asingle training process and accomplish each task from context according to thegiven prompt. It can further generalize to new, unseen tasks according tocustomized prompts. To facilitate context perception, we additionally propose atask-unified prompt, which adaptively learns tasks of different natures, suchas partial joint-level generation, sequence-level prediction, or 2D-to-3Dmotion prediction. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate theeffectiveness of our SiC on multiple tasks, including motion prediction, poseestimation, joint completion, and future pose estimation. We also evaluate itsgeneralization capability on unseen tasks such as motion-in-between. Theseexperiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art multi-taskperformance and even outperforms single-task methods on certain tasks.</description><author>Xinshun Wang, Zhongbin Fang, Xia Li, Xiangtai Li, Chen Chen, Mengyuan Liu</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 18:59:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03703v1</guid></item><item><title>Self-conditioned Image Generation via Generating Representations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03701v1</link><description>This paper presents $\textbf{R}$epresentation-$\textbf{C}$onditioned image$\textbf{G}$eneration (RCG), a simple yet effective image generation frameworkwhich sets a new benchmark in class-unconditional image generation. RCG doesnot condition on any human annotations. Instead, it conditions on aself-supervised representation distribution which is mapped from the imagedistribution using a pre-trained encoder. During generation, RCG samples fromsuch representation distribution using a representation diffusion model (RDM),and employs a pixel generator to craft image pixels conditioned on the sampledrepresentation. Such a design provides substantial guidance during thegenerative process, resulting in high-quality image generation. Tested onImageNet 256$\times$256, RCG achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of3.31 and an Inception Score (IS) of 253.4. These results not only significantlyimprove the state-of-the-art of class-unconditional image generation but alsorival the current leading methods in class-conditional image generation,bridging the long-standing performance gap between these two tasks.

However, existingworks rely heavily on modality-specific encoders, which usually differ inarchitecture and are limited to common modalities. In this paper, we presentOneLLM, an MLLM that aligns eight modalities to language using a unifiedframework. We achieve this through a unified multimodal encoder and aprogressive multimodal alignment pipeline. In detail, we first train an imageprojection module to connect a vision encoder with LLM. Then, we build auniversal projection module (UPM) by mixing multiple image projection modulesand dynamic routing. Finally, we progressively align more modalities to LLMwith the UPM. To fully leverage the potential of OneLLM in followinginstructions, we also curated a comprehensive multimodal instruction dataset,including 2M items from image, audio, video, point cloud, depth/normal map, IMUand fMRI brain activity. OneLLM is evaluated on 25 diverse benchmarks,encompassing tasks such as multimodal captioning, question answering andreasoning, where it delivers excellent performance.

Most existingmethods are trained to reverse global edits made on segmented image regions,which fail to accurately capture the lighting inconsistencies between theforeground and background found in composited images. In this work, weintroduce a self-supervised illumination harmonization approach formulated inthe intrinsic image domain. First, we estimate a simple global lighting modelfrom mid-level vision representations to generate a rough shading for theforeground region. A network then refines this inferred shading to generate aharmonious re-shading that aligns with the background scene. In order to matchthe color appearance of the foreground and background, we utilize ideas fromprior harmonization approaches to perform parameterized image edits in thealbedo domain. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we presentresults from challenging real-world composites and conduct a user study toobjectively measure the enhanced realism achieved compared to state-of-the-artharmonization methods.</description><author>Chris Careaga, Yağız Aksoy, S.

We call this problemshift-response function (SRF) estimation. Existing neural network methodsinvolving robust causal-effect estimators lack theoretical guarantees andpractical implementations for SRF estimation. Motivated by a keypolicy-relevant question in public health, we develop a neural network methodand its theoretical underpinnings to estimate SRFs with robustness andefficiency guarantees. We then apply our method to data consisting of 68million individuals and 27 million deaths across the U.S. to estimate thecausal effect from revising the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards(NAAQS) for PM 2.5 from 12 $\mu g/m^3$ to 9 $\mu g/m^3$. This change has beenrecently proposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Our goal isto estimate, for the first time, the reduction in deaths that would result fromthis anticipated revision using causal methods for SRFs. Our proposed method,called {T}argeted {R}egularization for {E}xposure {S}hifts with Neural{Net}works (TRESNET), contributes to the neural network literature for causalinference in two ways: first, it proposes a targeted regularization loss withtheoretical properties that ensure double robustness and achieves asymptoticefficiency specific for SRF estimation; second, it enables loss functions fromthe exponential family of distributions to accommodate non-continuous outcomedistributions (such as hospitalization or mortality counts). We complement ourapplication with benchmark experiments that demonstrate TRESNET's broadapplicability and competitiveness.</description><author>Mauricio Tec, Oladimeji Mudele, Kevin Josey, Francesca Dominici</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 18:55:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02560v3</guid></item><item><title>Memory Triggers: Unveiling Memorization in Text-To-Image Generative Models through Word-Level Duplication</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03692v1</link><description>Diffusion-based models, such as the Stable Diffusion model, haverevolutionized text-to-image synthesis with their ability to producehigh-quality, high-resolution images. These advancements have promptedsignificant progress in image generation and editing tasks. However, thesemodels also raise concerns due to their tendency to memorize and potentiallyreplicate exact training samples, posing privacy risks and enabling adversarialattacks. Duplication in training datasets is recognized as a major factorcontributing to memorization, and various forms of memorization have beenstudied so far. This paper focuses on two distinct and underexplored types ofduplication that lead to replication during inference in diffusion-basedmodels, particularly in the Stable Diffusion model. We delve into theselesser-studied duplication phenomena and their implications through two casestudies, aiming to contribute to the safer and more responsible use ofgenerative models in various applications.</description><author>Ali Naseh, Jaechul Roh, Amir Houmansadr</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 18:54:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03692v1</guid></item><item><title>On the Role of Edge Dependency in Graph Generative Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03691v1</link><description>In this work, we introduce a novel evaluation framework for generative modelsof graphs, emphasizing the importance of model-generated graph overlap(Chanpuriya et al., 2021) to ensure both accuracy and edge-diversity. Wedelineate a hierarchy of graph generative models categorized into three levelsof complexity: edge independent, node independent, and fully dependent models.This hierarchy encapsulates a wide range of prevalent methods. We derivetheoretical bounds on the number of triangles and other short-length cyclesproducible by each level of the hierarchy, contingent on the model overlap.

Through acombination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning (ML),particularly a novel graph variational autoencoder (VAE) model, we establish amethod for generating novel vitrimers and guide their inverse design based ondesired glass transition temperature (Tg). We build the first vitrimer datasetof one million and calculate Tg on 8,424 of them by high-throughput MDsimulations calibrated by a Gaussian process model. The proposed VAE employsdual graph encoders and a latent dimension overlapping scheme which allows forindividual representation of multi-component vitrimers. By constructing acontinuous latent space containing necessary information of vitrimers, wedemonstrate high accuracy and efficiency of our framework in discovering novelvitrimers with desirable Tg beyond the training regime. The proposed vitrimerswith reasonable synthesizability cover a wide range of Tg and broaden thepotential widespread usage of vitrimeric materials.</description><author>Yiwen Zheng, Prakash Thakolkaran, Jake A.

However, their potential for discrimination in such contextsraises ethical concerns, motivating the need for better methods to evaluatethese risks. We present a method for proactively evaluating the potentialdiscriminatory impact of LMs in a wide range of use cases, includinghypothetical use cases where they have not yet been deployed. Specifically, weuse an LM to generate a wide array of potential prompts that decision-makersmay input into an LM, spanning 70 diverse decision scenarios across society,and systematically vary the demographic information in each prompt. Applyingthis methodology reveals patterns of both positive and negative discriminationin the Claude 2.0 model in select settings when no interventions are applied.While we do not endorse or permit the use of language models to make automateddecisions for the high-risk use cases we study, we demonstrate techniques tosignificantly decrease both positive and negative discrimination throughcareful prompt engineering, providing pathways toward safer deployment in usecases where they may be appropriate. Our work enables developers andpolicymakers to anticipate, measure, and address discrimination as languagemodel capabilities and applications continue to expand.

Generative models provide a new paradigm for materials designby directly generating entirely novel materials given desired propertyconstraints. Despite recent progress, current generative models have lowsuccess rate in proposing stable crystals, or can only satisfy a very limitedset of property constraints. Here, we present MatterGen, a model that generatesstable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can furtherbe fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of propertyconstraints. To enable this, we introduce a new diffusion-based generativeprocess that produces crystalline structures by gradually refining atom types,coordinates, and the periodic lattice. We further introduce adapter modules toenable fine-tuning towards any given property constraints with a labeleddataset. Compared to prior generative models, structures produced by MatterGenare more than twice as likely to be novel and stable, and more than 15 timescloser to the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning, MatterGen successfullygenerates stable, novel materials with desired chemistry, symmetry, as well asmechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. Finally, we demonstratemulti-property materials design capabilities by proposing structures that haveboth high magnetic density and a chemical composition with low supply-chainrisk. We believe that the quality of generated materials and the breadth ofMatterGen's capabilities represent a major advancement towards creating auniversal generative model for materials design.</description><author>Claudio Zeni, Robert Pinsler, Daniel Zügner, Andrew Fowler, Matthew Horton, Xiang Fu, Sasha Shysheya, Jonathan Crabbé, Lixin Sun, Jake Smith, Ryota Tomioka, Tian Xie</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 18:52:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03687v1</guid></item><item><title>What Planning Problems Can A Relational Neural Network Solve?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03682v1</link><description>Goal-conditioned policies are generally understood to be "feed-forward"circuits, in the form of neural networks that map from the current state andthe goal specification to the next action to take. However, under whatcircumstances such a policy can be learned and how efficient the policy will beare not well understood. In this paper, we present a circuit complexityanalysis for relational neural networks (such as graph neural networks andtransformers) representing policies for planning problems, by drawingconnections with serialized goal regression search (S-GRS). We show that thereare three general classes of planning problems, in terms of the growth ofcircuit width and depth as a function of the number of objects and planninghorizon, providing constructive proofs. We also illustrate the utility of thisanalysis for designing neural networks for policy learning.</description><author>Jiayuan Mao, Tomás Lozano-Pérez, Joshua B.

Due to the limitations in diversity and challenges in handlinglighting conditions, traditional rendering-based methods are increasingly beingsupplanted by diffusion-based methods. However, a significant challenge indiffusion-based methods is ensuring that the generated sensor data preserveboth intra-world consistency and inter-sensor coherence. To address thesechallenges, we combine an additional explicit world volume and propose theWorld Volume-aware Multi-camera Driving Scene Generator (WoVoGen). This systemis specifically designed to leverage 4D world volume as a foundational elementfor video generation. Our model operates in two distinct phases: (i)envisioning the future 4D temporal world volume based on vehicle controlsequences, and (ii) generating multi-camera videos, informed by this envisioned4D temporal world volume and sensor interconnectivity. The incorporation of the4D world volume empowers WoVoGen not only to generate high-quality street-viewvideos in response to vehicle control inputs but also to facilitate sceneediting tasks.</description><author>Jiachen Lu, Ze Huang, Jiahui Zhang, Zeyu Yang, Li Zhang</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 18:45:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02934v2</guid></item><item><title>Hybrid Functional Maps for Crease-Aware Non-Isometric Shape Matching</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03678v1</link><description>Non-isometric shape correspondence remains a fundamental challenge incomputer vision.

The most widely usedalgorithms for primary subtraction aim to decouple bright stellar speckle noisefrom planetary signatures by subtracting an approximation of the temporallyevolving stellar noise from each frame in an imaging sequence. Our approachaims to improve the stellar noise approximation and increase the planetdetection sensitivity by leveraging deep learning in a novel direct imagingpost-processing algorithm.

This tool is used in a post-processing algorithm wecall Direct Exoplanet Detection with Convolutional Image Reconstruction, orConStruct. The reliability and sensitivity of ConStruct are assessed using realKeck/NIRC2 angular differential imaging datasets. Of the 30 unique pointsources we examine, ConStruct yields a higher S/N than traditional PCA-basedprocessing for 67$\%$ of the cases and improves the relative contrast by up toa factor of 2.6.

While existing methods focus on warping the garment tofit the body pose, they often overlook the synthesis quality around thegarment-skin boundary and realistic effects like wrinkles and shadows on thewarped garments. These limitations greatly reduce the realism of the generatedresults and hinder the practical application of VITON techniques. Leveragingthe notable success of diffusion-based models in cross-modal image synthesis,some recent diffusion-based methods have ventured to tackle this issue.However, they tend to either consume a significant amount of training resourcesor struggle to achieve realistic try-on effects and retain garment details. Forefficient and high-fidelity VITON, we propose WarpDiffusion, which bridges thewarping-based and diffusion-based paradigms via a novel informative and localgarment feature attention mechanism. Specifically, WarpDiffusion incorporateslocal texture attention to reduce resource consumption and uses a novelauto-mask module that effectively retains only the critical areas of the warpedgarment while disregarding unrealistic or erroneous portions. Notably,WarpDiffusion can be integrated as a plug-and-play component into existingVITON methodologies, elevating their synthesis quality. Extensive experimentson high-resolution VITON benchmarks and an in-the-wild test set demonstrate thesuperiority of WarpDiffusion, surpassing state-of-the-art methods bothqualitatively and quantitatively.</description><author>xujie zhang, Xiu Li, Michael Kampffmeyer, Xin Dong, Zhenyu Xie, Feida Zhu, Haoye Dong, Xiaodan Liang</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 18:34:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03667v1</guid></item><item><title>Towards small and accurate convolutional neural networks for acoustic biodiversity monitoring</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03666v1</link><description>Automated classification of animal sounds is a prerequisite for large-scalemonitoring of biodiversity. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are among themost promising algorithms but they are slow, often achieve poor classificationin the field and typically require large training data sets. Our objective wasto design CNNs that are fast at inference time and achieve good classificationperformance while learning from moderate-sized data. Recordings from arainforest ecosystem were used. Start and end-point of sounds from 20 birdspecies were manually annotated. Spectrograms from 10 second segments were usedas CNN input. We designed simple CNNs with a frequency unwrapping layer(SIMP-FU models) such that any output unit was connected to all spectrogramfrequencies but only to a sub-region of time, the Receptive Field (RF). Ourmodels allowed experimentation with different RF durations. Models either usedthe time-indexed labels that encode start and end-point of sounds or simplersegment-level labels. Models learning from time-indexed labels performedconsiderably better than their segment-level counterparts. Best classificationperformances was achieved for models with intermediate RF duration of 1.5seconds. The best SIMP-FU models achieved AUCs over 0.95 in 18 of 20 classes onthe test set. On compact low-cost hardware the best SIMP-FU models evaluated upto seven times faster than real-time data acquisition. RF duration was a majordriver of classification performance. The optimum of 1.5 s was in the samerange as the duration of the sounds. Our models achieved good classificationperformance while learning from moderate-sized training data. This is explainedby the usage of time-indexed labels during training and adequately sized RF.Results confirm the feasibility of deploying small CNNs with goodclassification performance on compact low-cost devices.</description><author>Serge Zaugg, Mike van der Schaar, Florence Erbs, Antonio Sanchez, Joan V.

The scope of this research method is nowpoised to grow dramatically as it absorbs the new affordances provided by LargeLanguage Models (LLM)s. Generative Agent-Based Models (GABM) are not justclassic Agent-Based Models (ABM)s where the agents talk to one another. Rather,GABMs are constructed using an LLM to apply common sense to situations, act"reasonably", recall common semantic knowledge, produce API calls to controldigital technologies like apps, and communicate both within the simulation andto researchers viewing it from the outside. Here we present Concordia, alibrary to facilitate constructing and working with GABMs. Concordia makes iteasy to construct language-mediated simulations of physically- ordigitally-grounded environments. Concordia agents produce their behavior usinga flexible component system which mediates between two fundamental operations:LLM calls and associative memory retrieval. A special agent called the GameMaster (GM), which was inspired by tabletop role-playing games, is responsiblefor simulating the environment where the agents interact. Agents take actionsby describing what they want to do in natural language. The GM then translatestheir actions into appropriate implementations. In a simulated physical world,the GM checks the physical plausibility of agent actions and describes theireffects. In digital environments simulating technologies such as apps andservices, the GM may handle API calls to integrate with external tools such asgeneral AI assistants (e.g., Bard, ChatGPT), and digital apps (e.g., Calendar,Email, Search, etc.). Concordia was designed to support a wide array ofapplications both in scientific research and for evaluating performance of realdigital services by simulating users and/or generating synthetic data.</description><author>Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets, John P.

Despite theirpotential, research in autonomous systems is hindered by the lack of datasetswith annotated reasoning chains that explain the decision-making processes indriving. To bridge this gap, we present Reason2Drive, a benchmark dataset withover 600K video-text pairs, aimed at facilitating the study of interpretablereasoning in complex driving environments. We distinctly characterize theautonomous driving process as a sequential combination of perception,prediction, and reasoning steps, and the question-answer pairs areautomatically collected from a diverse range of open-source outdoor drivingdatasets, including nuScenes, Waymo and ONCE. Moreover, we introduce a novelaggregated evaluation metric to assess chain-based reasoning performance inautonomous systems, addressing the semantic ambiguities of existing metricssuch as BLEU and CIDEr. Based on the proposed benchmark, we conduct experimentsto assess various existing VLMs, revealing insights into their reasoningcapabilities. Additionally, we develop an efficient approach to empower VLMs toleverage object-level perceptual elements in both feature extraction andprediction, further enhancing their reasoning accuracy.

This approach assumesthat the results of these simplified are faithful to the original model. Here,we illustrate an important caveat to this assumption: even if the simplifiedrepresentations can accurately approximate the full model on the training set,they may fail to accurately capture the model's behavior out of distribution --the understanding developed from simplified representations may be an illusion.We illustrate this by training Transformer models on controlled datasets withsystematic generalization splits. First, we train models on the Dyckbalanced-parenthesis languages. We simplify these models using tools likedimensionality reduction and clustering, and then explicitly test how thesesimplified proxies match the behavior of the original model on variousout-of-distribution test sets. We find that the simplified proxies aregenerally less faithful out of distribution. In cases where the original modelgeneralizes to novel structures or deeper depths, the simplified versions mayfail, or generalize better. This finding holds even if the simplifiedrepresentations do not directly depend on the training distribution. Next, westudy a more naturalistic task: predicting the next character in a dataset ofcomputer code. We find similar generalization gaps between the original modeland simplified proxies, and conduct further analysis to investigate whichaspects of the code completion task are associated with the largest gaps.Together, our results raise questions about the extent to which mechanisticinterpretations derived using tools like SVD can reliably predict what a modelwill do in novel situations.</description><author>Dan Friedman, Andrew Lampinen, Lucas Dixon, Danqi Chen, Asma Ghandeharioun</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 18:25:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03656v1</guid></item><item><title>Source-Free Domain Adaptation for RGB-D Semantic Segmentation with Vision Transformers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14269v2</link><description>With the increasing availability of depth sensors, multimodal frameworks thatcombine color information with depth data are gaining interest. However, groundtruth data for semantic segmentation is burdensome to provide, thus makingdomain adaptation a significant research area. Yet most domain adaptationmethods are not able to effectively handle multimodal data. Specifically, weaddress the challenging source-free domain adaptation setting where theadaptation is performed without reusing source data. We propose MISFIT:MultImodal Source-Free Information fusion Transformer, a depth-aware frameworkwhich injects depth data into a segmentation module based on visiontransformers at multiple stages, namely at the input, feature and outputlevels. Color and depth style transfer helps early-stage domain alignment whilere-wiring self-attention between modalities creates mixed features, allowingthe extraction of better semantic content. Furthermore, a depth-based entropyminimization strategy is also proposed to adaptively weight regions atdifferent distances. Our framework, which is also the first approach usingRGB-D vision transformers for source-free semantic segmentation, showsnoticeable performance improvements with respect to standard strategies.</description><author>Giulia Rizzoli, Donald Shenaj, Pietro Zanuttigh</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 18:21:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14269v2</guid></item><item><title>Efficient Inverse Design Optimization through Multi-fidelity Simulations, Machine Learning, and Search Space Reduction Strategies</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03654v1</link><description>This paper introduces a methodology designed to augment the inverse designoptimization process in scenarios constrained by limited compute, through thestrategic synergy of multi-fidelity evaluations, machine learning models, andoptimization algorithms.

Two issues which complicate theproblem on such datasets are class imbalance and ground-truth uncertainty inlabeling. The AL-ALL and AL-PUB datasets - consisting of tightly cropped,individual characters from images of ancient Greek papyri - are stronglyaffected by both issues. The application of ensemble modeling to such datasetscan help identify images where the ground-truth is questionable and quantifythe trustworthiness of those samples. As such, we apply stacked generalizationconsisting of nearly identical ResNets with different loss functions: oneutilizing sparse cross-entropy (CXE) and the other Kullback-Liebler Divergence(KLD). Both networks use labels drawn from a crowd-sourced consensus. Thisconsensus is derived from a Normalized Distribution of Annotations (NDA) basedon all annotations for a given character in the dataset. For the secondnetwork, the KLD is calculated with respect to the NDA. For our ensemble model,we apply a k-nearest neighbors model to the outputs of the CXE and KLDnetworks. Individually, the ResNet models have approximately 93% accuracy,while the ensemble model achieves an accuracy of &gt; 95%, increasing theclassification trustworthiness. We also perform an analysis of the Shannonentropy of the various models' output distributions to measure classificationuncertainty. Our results suggest that entropy is useful for predicting modelmisclassifications.</description><author>Graham West, Matthew I. Swindall, Ben Keener, Timothy Player, Alex C. Williams, James H.

While independent learning inMARL offers flexibility and scalability, accurately assigning credit toindividual agents in offline settings poses challenges due to partialobservability and emergent behavior. Directly transferring the online creditassignment method to offline settings results in suboptimal outcomes due to theabsence of real-time feedback and intricate agent interactions. Our approach,MACCA, characterizing the generative process as a Dynamic Bayesian Network,captures relationships between environmental variables, states, actions, andrewards. Estimating this model on offline data, MACCA can learn each agent'scontribution by analyzing the causal relationship of their individual rewards,ensuring accurate and interpretable credit assignment. Additionally, themodularity of our approach allows it to seamlessly integrate with variousoffline MARL methods. Theoretically, we proved that under the setting of theoffline dataset, the underlying causal structure and the function forgenerating the individual rewards of agents are identifiable, which laid thefoundation for the correctness of our modeling. Experimentally, we tested MACCAin two environments, including discrete and continuous action settings. Theresults show that MACCA outperforms SOTA methods and improves performance upontheir backbones.</description><author>Ziyan Wang, Yali Du, Yudi Zhang, Meng Fang, Biwei Huang</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 17:59:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03644v1</guid></item><item><title>Transformer-Powered Surrogates Close the ICF Simulation-Experiment Gap with Extremely Limited Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03642v1</link><description>Recent advances in machine learning, specifically transformer architecture,have led to significant advancements in commercial domains.

Their underlying idea is to (i) run a forwardprocess for time $T_1$ by adding noise to the data, (ii) estimate its scorefunction, and (iii) use such estimate to run a reverse process. As the reverseprocess is initialized with the stationary distribution of the forward one, theexisting analysis paradigm requires $T_1\to\infty$. This is howeverproblematic: from a theoretical viewpoint, for a given precision of the scoreapproximation, the convergence guarantee fails as $T_1$ diverges; from apractical viewpoint, a large $T_1$ increases computational costs and leads toerror propagation. This paper addresses the issue by considering a version ofthe popular predictor-corrector scheme: after running the forward process, wefirst estimate the final distribution via an inexact Langevin dynamics and thenrevert the process. Our key technical contribution is to provide convergenceguarantees which require to run the forward process only for a fixed finitetime $T_1$. Our bounds exhibit a mild logarithmic dependence on the inputdimension and the subgaussian norm of the target distribution, have minimalassumptions on the data, and require only to control the $L^2$ loss on thescore approximation, which is the quantity minimized in practice.</description><author>Francesco Pedrotti, Jan Maas, Marco Mondelli</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 17:50:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14164v2</guid></item><item><title>MotionCtrl: A Unified and Flexible Motion Controller for Video Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03641v1</link><description>Motions in a video primarily consist of camera motion, induced by cameramovement, and object motion, resulting from object movement. Accurate controlof both camera and object motion is essential for video generation. However,existing works either mainly focus on one type of motion or do not clearlydistinguish between the two, limiting their control capabilities and diversity.Therefore, this paper presents MotionCtrl, a unified and flexible motioncontroller for video generation designed to effectively and independentlycontrol camera and object motion. The architecture and training strategy ofMotionCtrl are carefully devised, taking into account the inherent propertiesof camera motion, object motion, and imperfect training data. Compared toprevious methods, MotionCtrl offers three main advantages: 1) It effectivelyand independently controls camera motion and object motion, enabling morefine-grained motion control and facilitating flexible and diverse combinationsof both types of motion. 2) Its motion conditions are determined by cameraposes and trajectories, which are appearance-free and minimally impact theappearance or shape of objects in generated videos. 3) It is a relativelygeneralizable model that can adapt to a wide array of camera poses andtrajectories once trained. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimentshave been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of MotionCtrl over existingmethods.</description><author>Zhouxia Wang, Ziyang Yuan, Xintao Wang, Tianshui Chen, Menghan Xia, Ping Luo, Ying Shan</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 17:49:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03641v1</guid></item><item><title>Training Neural Networks on RAW and HDR Images for Restoration Tasks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03640v1</link><description>The vast majority of standard image and video content available online isrepresented in display-encoded color spaces, in which pixel values areconveniently scaled to a limited range (0-1) and the color distribution isapproximately perceptually uniform. In contrast, both camera RAW and highdynamic range (HDR) images are often represented in linear color spaces, inwhich color values are linearly related to colorimetric quantities of light.While training on commonly available display-encoded images is awell-established practice, there is no consensus on how neural networks shouldbe trained for tasks on RAW and HDR images in linear color spaces. In thiswork, we test several approaches on three popular image restorationapplications: denoising, deblurring, and single-image super-resolution. Weexamine whether HDR/RAW images need to be display-encoded using populartransfer functions (PQ, PU21, mu-law), or whether it is better to train inlinear color spaces, but use loss functions that correct for perceptualnon-uniformity. Our results indicate that neural networks train significantlybetter on HDR and RAW images represented in display-encoded color spaces, whichoffer better perceptual uniformity than linear spaces. This small change to thetraining strategy can bring a very substantial gain in performance, up to 10-15dB.</description><author>Lei Luo, Alexandre Chapiro, Xiaoyu Xiang, Yuchen Fan, Rakesh Ranjan, Rafal Mantiuk</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 17:47:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03640v1</guid></item><item><title>Not All Large Language Models (LLMs) Succumb to the "Reversal Curse": A Comparative Study of Deductive Logical Reasoning in BERT and GPT Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03633v1</link><description>The "Reversal Curse" refers to the scenario where auto-regressive decoderlarge language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, trained on "A is B" fail tolearn "B is A", demonstrating a basic failure of logical deduction.

Dedicated methods for reducing hallucinations in imagecaptioning largely focus on closed-vocabulary object tokens, ignoring mosttypes of hallucinations that occur in practice. In this work, we propose MOCHa,an approach that harnesses advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) toaddress the sequence-level nature of hallucinations in an open-world setup. Tooptimize for caption fidelity to the input image, we leverage ground-truthreference captions as proxies to measure the logical consistency of generatedcaptions. However, optimizing for caption fidelity alone fails to preserve thesemantic adequacy of generations; therefore, we propose a multi-objectivereward function that jointly targets these qualities, without requiring anystrong supervision. We demonstrate that these goals can be simultaneouslyoptimized with our framework, enhancing performance for various captioningmodels of different scales. Our qualitative and quantitative resultsdemonstrate MOCHa's superior performance across various established metrics. Wealso demonstrate the benefit of our method in the open-vocabulary setting.

Through this method, we are able to achieve macro average and weightedaverage F1-Scores of 0.75 and 0.85 respectively. The third technique uses anAI-assisted tagging tool to tag and structure the raw maintenance information,together with a novel rule-based approach for extracting relevant maintenancework orders for failure rate calculation. In our experiments the AI-assistedtool leads to a 88% drop in tagging time in comparison to the other twoapproaches, while expert labeling and text classification are more accurate inKPI extraction. Overall, our findings make extracting maintenance informationfrom maintenance work orders more efficient, enable the assessment ofreliability key performance indicators and therefore support the optimizationof wind turbine operation and maintenance.</description><author>Marc-Alexander Lutz, Bastian Schäfermeier, Rachael Sexton, Michael Sharp, Alden Dima, Stefan Faulstich, Jagan Mohini Aluri</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 17:17:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04064v2</guid></item><item><title>Consensus, dissensus and synergy between clinicians and specialist foundation models in radiology report generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18260v2</link><description>Radiology reports are an instrumental part of modern medicine, informing keyclinical decisions such as diagnosis and treatment. The worldwide shortage ofradiologists, however, restricts access to expert care and imposes heavyworkloads, contributing to avoidable errors and delays in report delivery.While recent progress in automated report generation with vision-languagemodels offer clear potential in ameliorating the situation, the path toreal-world adoption has been stymied by the challenge of evaluating theclinical quality of AI-generated reports. In this study, we build astate-of-the-art report generation system for chest radiographs,\textit{Flamingo-CXR}, by fine-tuning a well-known vision-language foundationmodel on radiology data. To evaluate the quality of the AI-generated reports, agroup of 16 certified radiologists provide detailed evaluations of AI-generatedand human written reports for chest X-rays from an intensive care setting inthe United States and an inpatient setting in India. At least one radiologist(out of two per case) preferred the AI report to the ground truth report inover 60$\%$ of cases for both datasets. Amongst the subset of AI-generatedreports that contain errors, the most frequently cited reasons were related tothe location and finding, whereas for human written reports, most mistakes wererelated to severity and finding. This disparity suggested potentialcomplementarity between our AI system and human experts, prompting us todevelop an assistive scenario in which \textit{Flamingo-CXR} generates afirst-draft report, which is subsequently revised by a clinician. This is thefirst demonstration of clinician-AI collaboration for report writing, and theresultant reports are assessed to be equivalent or preferred by at least oneradiologist to reports written by experts alone in 80$\%$ of in-patient casesand 60$\%$ of intensive care cases.</description><author>Ryutaro Tanno, David G.

As deploying an AFA agentintroduces a shift in missingness distribution, it's vital to assess itsexpected performance at deployment using retrospective data. In a companionpaper, we introduce a semi-offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework foractive feature acquisition performance evaluation (AFAPE) where features areassumed to be time-dependent. Here, we study and extend the AFAPE problem tocover static feature settings, where features are time-invariant, and henceprovide more flexibility to the AFA agents in deciding the order of theacquisitions. In this static feature setting, we derive and adapt new inverseprobability weighting (IPW), direct method (DM), and double reinforcementlearning (DRL) estimators within the semi-offline RL framework. Theseestimators can be applied when the missingness in the retrospective datasetfollows a missing-at-random (MAR) pattern. They also can be applied tomissing-not-at-random (MNAR) patterns in conjunction with appropriate existingmissing data techniques. We illustrate the improved data efficiency offered bythe semi-offline RL estimators in synthetic and real-world data experimentsunder synthetic MAR and MNAR missingness.</description><author>Henrik von Kleist, Alireza Zamanian, Ilya Shpitser, Narges Ahmidi</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 17:07:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03619v1</guid></item><item><title>LLMLingua: Compressing Prompts for Accelerated Inference of Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05736v2</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have been applied in various applications due totheir astonishing capabilities.

Each is responsible fordifferent parts of the process. This is often done in a sequential manner, e.g.the structural engineer makes a design under the assumption of certain materialproperties (e.g. the strength class of the concrete), and then the materialengineer optimizes the material with these restrictions. This paper proposes aholistic optimization procedure, which combines the concrete mixture design andstructural simulations in a joint, forward workflow that we ultimately seek toinvert. In this manner, new mixtures beyond standard ranges can be considered.Any design effort should account for the presence of uncertainties which can bealeatoric or epistemic as when data is used to calibrate physical models oridentify models that fill missing links in the workflow. Inverting the causalrelations established poses several challenges especially when these involvephysics-based models which most often than not do not providederivatives/sensitivities or when design constraints are present. To this end,we advocate Variational Optimization, with proposed extensions andappropriately chosen heuristics to overcome the aforementioned challenges. Theproposed methodology is illustrated using the design of a precast concrete beamwith the objective to minimize the global warming potential while satisfying anumber of constraints associated with its load-bearing capacity after 28daysaccording to the Eurocode, the demoulding time as computed by a complexnonlinear Finite Element model, and the maximum temperature during thehydration.</description><author>Atul Agrawal, Erik Tamsen, Phaedon-Stelios Koutsourelakis, Joerg F.

However, existing models are not tailoredto support remote sensing data, which is widely used in important applicationsincluding environmental monitoring and crop-yield prediction. Satellite imagesare significantly different from natural images -- they can be multi-spectral,irregularly sampled across time -- and existing diffusion models trained onimages from the Web do not support them. Furthermore, remote sensing data isinherently spatio-temporal, requiring conditional generation tasks notsupported by traditional methods based on captions or images. In this paper, wepresent DiffusionSat, to date the largest generative foundation model trainedon a collection of publicly available large, high-resolution remote sensingdatasets. As text-based captions are sparsely available for satellite images,we incorporate the associated metadata such as geolocation as conditioninginformation. Our method produces realistic samples and can be used to solvemultiple generative tasks including temporal generation, superresolution givenmulti-spectral inputs and in-painting.

Their accessibility for analyticconsiderations also opens up the possibility of prescreening datasets based ontheir potential for a quantum advantage. To do so, earlier works developed thegeometric difference, which can be understood as a closeness measure betweentwo kernel-based machine learning approaches, most importantly between aquantum kernel and classical kernel. This metric links the quantum andclassical model complexities. Therefore, it raises the question of whether thegeometric difference, based on its relation to model complexity, can be auseful tool in evaluations other than for the potential for quantum advantage.In this work, we investigate the effects of hyperparameter choice on the modelperformance and the generalization gap between classical and quantum kernels.The importance of hyperparameter optimization is well known also for classicalmachine learning. Especially for the quantum Hamiltonian evolution feature map,the scaling of the input data has been shown to be crucial. However, there areadditional parameters left to be optimized, like the best number of qubits totrace out before computing a projected quantum kernel. We investigate theinfluence of these hyperparameters and compare the classically reliable methodof cross validation with the method of choosing based on the geometricdifference. Based on the thorough investigation of the hyperparameters across11 datasets we identified commodities that can be exploited when examining anew dataset. In addition, our findings contribute to better understanding ofthe applicability of the geometric difference.</description><author>Sebastian Egginger, Alona Sakhnenko, Jeanette Miriam Lorenz</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 16:51:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11891v2</guid></item><item><title>Dimensionless Anomaly Detection on Multivariate Streams with Variance Norm and Path Signature</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03487v2</link><description>In this paper, we propose a dimensionless anomaly detection method formultivariate streams.

However, these models oftensuffer from a trade-off between real-time performance, high fidelity, andmotion editability. To address this gap, we introduce MMM, a novel yet simplemotion generation paradigm based on Masked Motion Model. MMM consists of twokey components: (1) a motion tokenizer that transforms 3D human motion into asequence of discrete tokens in latent space, and (2) a conditional maskedmotion transformer that learns to predict randomly masked motion tokens,conditioned on the pre-computed text tokens. By attending to motion and texttokens in all directions, MMM explicitly captures inherent dependency amongmotion tokens and semantic mapping between motion and text tokens. Duringinference, this allows parallel and iterative decoding of multiple motiontokens that are highly consistent with fine-grained text descriptions,therefore simultaneously achieving high-fidelity and high-speed motiongeneration. In addition, MMM has innate motion editability. By simply placingmask tokens in the place that needs editing, MMM automatically fills the gapswhile guaranteeing smooth transitions between editing and non-editing parts.Extensive experiments on the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that MMMsurpasses current leading methods in generating high-quality motion (evidencedby superior FID scores of 0.08 and 0.429), while offering advanced editingfeatures such as body-part modification, motion in-betweening, and thesynthesis of long motion sequences. In addition, MMM is two orders of magnitudefaster on a single mid-range GPU than editable motion diffusion models.

An outstanding limitation is length generalization,meaning that when trained on reasoning problems of smaller lengths or sizes,the resulting models struggle with problems of larger sizes or lengths. Thispotentially indicates some theoretical limitations of generalization inlearning reasoning skills. These evaluations and their observations motivatedus to perform a theoretical study of the length generalization problem. Thiswork focuses on reasoning tasks that can be formulated as Markov dynamicprocesses (MDPs) and/or directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It identifies andproves conditions that decide whether the length generalization problem can besolved or not for a reasoning task in a particular representation.

The present work introduces an autoencoder framework that combinesimplicit regularization with internal linear layers and $L_2$ regularization(weight decay) to automatically estimate the underlying dimensionality of adata set, produce an orthogonal manifold coordinate system, and provide themapping functions between the ambient space and manifold space, allowing forout-of-sample projections. We validate our framework's ability to estimate themanifold dimension for a series of datasets from dynamical systems of varyingcomplexities and compare to other state-of-the-art estimators. We analyze thetraining dynamics of the network to glean insight into the mechanism oflow-rank learning and find that collectively each of the implicit regularizinglayers compound the low-rank representation and even self-correct duringtraining. Analysis of gradient descent dynamics for this architecture in thelinear case reveals the role of the internal linear layers in leading to fasterdecay of a "collective weight variable" incorporating all layers, and the roleof weight decay in breaking degeneracies and thus driving convergence alongdirections in which no decay would occur in its absence. We show that thisframework can be naturally extended for applications of state-space modelingand forecasting by generating a data-driven dynamic model of a spatiotemporallychaotic partial differential equation using only the manifold coordinates.Finally, we demonstrate that our framework is robust to hyperparameter choices.</description><author>Kevin Zeng, Carlos E.

Tominimize the adaption cost for downstream tasks, many Parameter-EfficientFine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques are proposed for language and 2D imagepre-trained models. However, the specialized PEFT method for 3D pre-trainedmodels is still under-explored. To this end, we introduce Point-PEFT, a novelframework for adapting point cloud pre-trained models with minimal learnableparameters. Specifically, for a pre-trained 3D model, we freeze most of itsparameters, and only tune the newly added PEFT modules on downstream tasks,which consist of a Point-prior Prompt and a Geometry-aware Adapter. ThePoint-prior Prompt adopts a set of learnable prompt tokens, for which wepropose to construct a memory bank with domain-specific knowledge, and utilizea parameter-free attention to enhance the prompt tokens. The Geometry-awareAdapter aims to aggregate point cloud features within spatial neighborhoods tocapture fine-grained geometric information through local interactions.Extensive experiments indicate that our Point-PEFT can achieve betterperformance than the full fine-tuning on various downstream tasks, while usingonly 5% of the trainable parameters, demonstrating the efficiency andeffectiveness of our approach.

We assay the connectionbetween invariance and causal representation learning by establishingimpossibility results which show that invariance alone is insufficient toidentify latent causal variables. Together with practical considerations, weuse these theoretical findings to highlight the need for additional constraintsin order to identify representations by exploiting invariance.</description><author>Simon Bing, Jonas Wahl, Urmi Ninad, Jakob Runge</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 16:16:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03580v1</guid></item><item><title>Improving Bias Mitigation through Bias Experts in Natural Language Understanding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03577v1</link><description>Biases in the dataset often enable the model to achieve high performance onin-distribution data, while poorly performing on out-of-distribution data. Tomitigate the detrimental effect of the bias on the networks, previous workshave proposed debiasing methods that down-weight the biased examples identifiedby an auxiliary model, which is trained with explicit bias labels. However,finding a type of bias in datasets is a costly process. Therefore, recentstudies have attempted to make the auxiliary model biased without the guidance(or annotation) of bias labels, by constraining the model's trainingenvironment or the capability of the model itself. Despite the promisingdebiasing results of recent works, the multi-class learning objective, whichhas been naively used to train the auxiliary model, may harm the biasmitigation effect due to its regularization effect and competitive natureacross classes. As an alternative, we propose a new debiasing framework thatintroduces binary classifiers between the auxiliary model and the main model,coined bias experts. Specifically, each bias expert is trained on a binaryclassification task derived from the multi-class classification task via theOne-vs-Rest approach. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposedstrategy improves the bias identification ability of the auxiliary model.Consequently, our debiased model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arton various challenge datasets.</description><author>Eojin Jeon, Mingyu Lee, Juhyeong Park, Yeachan Kim, Wing-Lam Mok, SangKeun Lee</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 16:15:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03577v1</guid></item><item><title>Harnessing machine learning for accurate treatment of overlapping opacity species in general circulation models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00775v3</link><description>To understand high precision observations of exoplanets and brown dwarfs, weneed detailed and complex general circulation models (GCMs) that incorporatehydrodynamics, chemistry, and radiation. For this study, we specificallyexamined the coupling between chemistry and radiation in GCMs and compareddifferent methods for the mixing of opacities of different chemical species inthe correlated-k assumption, when equilibrium chemistry cannot be assumed. Wepropose a fast machine learning method based on DeepSets (DS), whicheffectively combines individual correlated-k opacities (k-tables). We evaluatedthe DS method alongside other published methods such as adaptive equivalentextinction (AEE) and random overlap with rebinning and resorting (RORR). Weintegrated these mixing methods into our GCM (expeRT/MITgcm) and assessed theiraccuracy and performance for the example of the hot Jupiter HD~209458 b. Ourfindings indicate that the DS method is both accurate and efficient for GCMusage, whereas RORR is too slow. Additionally, we observed that the accuracy ofAEE depends on its specific implementation and may introduce numerical issuesin achieving radiative transfer solution convergence. We then applied the DSmixing method in a simplified chemical disequilibrium situation, where wemodeled the rainout of TiO and VO, and confirmed that the rainout of TiO and VOwould hinder the formation of a stratosphere. To further expedite thedevelopment of consistent disequilibrium chemistry calculations in GCMs, weprovide documentation and code for coupling the DS mixing method withcorrelated-k radiative transfer solvers. The DS method has been extensivelytested to be accurate enough for GCMs; however, other methods might be neededfor accelerating atmospheric retrievals.</description><author>Aaron David Schneider, Paul Mollière, Gilles Louppe, Ludmila Carone, Uffe Gråe Jørgensen, Leen Decin, Christiane Helling</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 16:08:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00775v3</guid></item><item><title>TIGERScore: Towards Building Explainable Metric for All Text Generation Tasks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00752v2</link><description>We present TIGERScore, a \textbf{T}rained metric that follows\textbf{I}nstruction \textbf{G}uidance to perform \textbf{E}xplainable, and\textbf{R}eference-free evaluation over a wide spectrum of text generationtasks.

We propose DocBinFormer (Document BinarizationTransformer), a novel two-level vision transformer (TL-ViT) architecture basedon vision transformers for effective document image binarization. The presentedarchitecture employs a two-level transformer encoder to effectively captureboth global and local feature representation from the input images. Thesecomplimentary bi-level features are exploited for efficient document imagebinarization, resulting in improved results for system-generated as well ashandwritten document images in a comprehensive approach. With the absence ofconvolutional layers, the transformer encoder uses the pixel patches andsub-patches along with their positional information to operate directly onthem, while the decoder generates a clean (binarized) output image from thelatent representation of the patches. Instead of using a simple visiontransformer block to extract information from the image patches, the proposedarchitecture uses two transformer blocks for greater coverage of the extractedfeature space on a global and local scale. The encoded feature representationis used by the decoder block to generate the corresponding binarized output.Extensive experiments on a variety of DIBCO and H-DIBCO benchmarks show thatthe proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on four metrics.

However, buildingthese systems typically requires expert-annotated QA pairs. Large languagemodels (LLMs), which can perform extractive QA, depend on high quality data intheir prompts, specialized for the application domain. We introduce a novelapproach, XAIQA, for generating synthetic QA pairs at scale from data naturallyavailable in electronic health records. Our method uses the idea of aclassification model explainer to generate questions and answers about medicalconcepts corresponding to medical codes. In an expert evaluation with twophysicians, our method identifies $2.2\times$ more semantic matches and$3.8\times$ more clinical abbreviations than two popular approaches that usesentence transformers to create QA pairs. In an ML evaluation, adding our QApairs improves performance of GPT-4 as an extractive QA model, including ondifficult questions.

Traditional methods either entail manual classification, which islaborious and error-prone, or utilize machine learning requiring extensivetraining data, often leading to model underfit or overfit issues. This studyunveils a novel approach employing the zero-shot and few-shot GenerativePretrained Transformer (GPT) classifier for hierarchical item categorization,minimizing the necessity for training data, and instead, leveraging human-likelanguage descriptions to define categories. Through a structured pythondictionary, the hierarchical nature of examination blueprints is navigatedseamlessly, allowing for a tiered classification of items across multiplelevels.

Despite the significantadvances in face generative models, ensuring that a person's unique facialidentity is maintained during the inpainting process is still an elusive goal.Current state-of-the-art techniques, exemplified by MyStyle, necessitateresource-intensive fine-tuning and a substantial number of images for each newidentity. Furthermore, existing methods often fall short in accommodatinguser-specified semantic attributes, such as beard or expression. To improveinpainting results, and reduce the computational complexity during inference,this paper proposes the use of Parallel Visual Attention (PVA) in conjunctionwith diffusion models. Specifically, we insert parallel attention matrices toeach cross-attention module in the denoising network, which attends to featuresextracted from reference images by an identity encoder. We train the addedattention modules and identity encoder on CelebAHQ-IDI, a dataset proposed foridentity-preserving face inpainting. Experiments demonstrate that PVA attainsunparalleled identity resemblance in both face inpainting and face inpaintingwith language guidance tasks, in comparison to various benchmarks, includingMyStyle, Paint by Example, and Custom Diffusion. Our findings reveal that PVAensures good identity preservation while offering effectivelanguage-controllability. Additionally, in contrast to Custom Diffusion, PVArequires just 40 fine-tuning steps for each new identity, which translates to asignificant speed increase of over 20 times.</description><author>Jianjin Xu, Saman Motamed, Praneetha Vaddamanu, Chen Henry Wu, Christian Haene, Jean-Charles Bazin, Fernando de la Torre</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 15:39:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03556v1</guid></item><item><title>Entailment Semantics Can Be Extracted from an Ideal Language Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12407v2</link><description>Language models are often trained on text alone, without additionalgrounding.

Their equilibrium distribution is thecanonical ensemble given by a prescribed target distribution, so they mustbalance fluctuation and dissipation as dictated by the fluctuation-dissipationtheorem. In contrast to the common belief, we show that thefluctuation-dissipation theorem is not required because only the configurationspace distribution, and not the full phase space distribution, needs to becanonical. We propose a continuous-time Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo(MCLMC) as a dissipation-free system of stochastic differential equations(SDE). We derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation and show that thestationary distribution is the microcanonical ensemble with the desiredcanonical distribution on configuration space. We prove that MCLMC is ergodicfor any nonzero amount of stochasticity, and for smooth, convex potentials, theexpectation values converge exponentially fast. Furthermore, the deterministicdrift and the stochastic diffusion separately preserve the stationarydistribution. This uncommon property is attractive for practicalimplementations as it implies that the drift-diffusion discretization schemesare bias-free, so the only source of bias is the discretization of thedeterministic dynamics. We applied MCLMC on a lattice $\phi^4$ model, whereHamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is currently the state-of-the-art integrator. Forthe same accuracy, MCLMC converges 12 times faster than HMC on an $8\times8$lattice. On a $64\times64$ lattice, it is already 32 times faster.

However, training these modelscan incur significant expenses, often requiring tens of thousands of GPUs formonths of continuous operation. Typically, this training is carried out inspecialized GPU clusters equipped with homogeneous high-speed Remote DirectMemory Access (RDMA) network interface cards (NICs). The acquisition andmaintenance of such dedicated clusters is challenging.

Due to the characteristics of ORSIs,ORSI-SOD is full of challenges, such as multiple objects, small objects, lowilluminations, and irregular shapes. To address these challenges, we propose aconcise yet effective Texture-Semantic Collaboration Network (TSCNet) toexplore the collaboration of texture cues and semantic cues for ORSI-SOD.Specifically, TSCNet is based on the generic encoder-decoder structure. Inaddition to the encoder and decoder, TSCNet includes a vital Texture-SemanticCollaboration Module (TSCM), which performs valuable feature modulation andinteraction on basic features extracted from the encoder. The main idea of ourTSCM is to make full use of the texture features at the lowest level and thesemantic features at the highest level to achieve the expression enhancement ofsalient regions on features. In the TSCM, we first enhance the position ofpotential salient regions using semantic features. Then, we render and restorethe object details using the texture features. Meanwhile, we also perceiveregions of various scales, and construct interactions between differentregions. Thanks to the perfect combination of TSCM and generic structure, ourTSCNet can take care of both the position and details of salient objects,effectively handling various scenes.

This paper introduces a sophisticated encoder-decoderframework, developed to address visual grounding in AVs.Our Context-AwareVisual Grounding (CAVG) model is an advanced system that integrates five coreencoders-Text, Image, Context, and Cross-Modal-with a Multimodal decoder. Thisintegration enables the CAVG model to adeptly capture contextual semantics andto learn human emotional features, augmented by state-of-the-art Large LanguageModels (LLMs) including GPT-4. The architecture of CAVG is reinforced by theimplementation of multi-head cross-modal attention mechanisms and aRegion-Specific Dynamic (RSD) layer for attention modulation. Thisarchitectural design enables the model to efficiently process and interpret arange of cross-modal inputs, yielding a comprehensive understanding of thecorrelation between verbal commands and corresponding visual scenes. Empiricalevaluations on the Talk2Car dataset, a real-world benchmark, demonstrate thatCAVG establishes new standards in prediction accuracy and operationalefficiency. Notably, the model exhibits exceptional performance even withlimited training data, ranging from 50% to 75% of the full dataset. Thisfeature highlights its effectiveness and potential for deployment in practicalAV applications. Moreover, CAVG has shown remarkable robustness andadaptability in challenging scenarios, including long-text commandinterpretation, low-light conditions, ambiguous command contexts, inclementweather conditions, and densely populated urban environments.

In this paper, we will therefore discuss differentmeans for measuring and 'calculating' with ordinal structures -- a specificclass of directed graphs -- and show how to infer knowledge from them. Our aimis to establish Ordinal Data Science as a fundamentally new research agenda.Besides cross-fertilization with other cornerstone machine learning andknowledge representation methods, a broad range of disciplines will benefitfrom this endeavor, including, psychology, sociology, economics, web science,knowledge engineering, scientometrics.</description><author>Gerd Stumme, Dominik Dürrschnabel, Tom Hanika</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 15:09:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09477v2</guid></item><item><title>FoodFusion: A Latent Diffusion Model for Realistic Food Image Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03540v1</link><description>Current state-of-the-art image generation models such as Latent DiffusionModels (LDMs) have demonstrated the capacity to produce visually strikingfood-related images. However, these generated images often exhibit an artisticor surreal quality that diverges from the authenticity of real-world foodrepresentations. This inadequacy renders them impractical for applicationsrequiring realistic food imagery, such as training models for image-baseddietary assessment. To address these limitations, we introduce FoodFusion, aLatent Diffusion model engineered specifically for the faithful synthesis ofrealistic food images from textual descriptions. The development of theFoodFusion model involves harnessing an extensive array of open-source fooddatasets, resulting in over 300,000 curated image-caption pairs. Additionally,we propose and employ two distinct data cleaning methodologies to ensure thatthe resulting image-text pairs maintain both realism and accuracy. TheFoodFusion model, thus trained, demonstrates a remarkable ability to generatefood images that exhibit a significant improvement in terms of both realism anddiversity over the publicly available image generation models.

Yet, existing solutions make strong assumptionson the form of input surfaces and the nature of output paths, resulting inlimited approaches unable to cope with real-data variability. By leveraging onrecent advances in 3D deep learning, we introduce a novel framework capable ofdealing with arbitrary 3D surfaces, and handling a variable number of unorderedoutput paths (i.e. unstructured). Our approach predicts local path segments,which can be later concatenated to reconstruct long-horizon paths. Weextensively validate the proposed method in the context of robotic spraypainting by releasing PaintNet, the first public dataset of expertdemonstrations on free-shape 3D objects collected in a real industrialscenario. A thorough experimental analysis demonstrates the capabilities of ourmodel to promptly predict smooth output paths that cover up to 95% ofpreviously unseen object surfaces, even without explicitly optimizing for paintcoverage.</description><author>Gabriele Tiboni, Raffaello Camoriano, Tatiana Tommasi</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 14:59:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06930v3</guid></item><item><title>Low-shot Object Learning with Mutual Exclusivity Bias</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03533v1</link><description>This paper introduces Low-shot Object Learning with Mutual Exclusivity Bias(LSME), the first computational framing of mutual exclusivity bias, aphenomenon commonly observed in infants during word learning.

The utilization ofunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, has shown promise inaiding wildfire management efforts. This work focuses on the development of anoptimal wildfire escape route planning system specifically designed for drones,considering dynamic fire and smoke models. First, the location of the source ofthe wildfire can be well located by information fusion between UAV andsatellite, and the road conditions in the vicinity of the fire can be assessedand analyzed using multi-channel remote sensing data. Second, the road networkcan be extracted and segmented in real time using UAV vision technology, andeach road in the road network map can be given priority based on the results ofroad condition classification. Third, the spread model of dynamic firescalculates the new location of the fire source based on the fire intensity,wind speed and direction, and the radius increases as the wildfire spreads.Smoke is generated around the fire source to create a visual representation ofa burning fire. Finally, based on the improved A* algorithm, which considersall the above factors, the UAV can quickly plan an escape route based on thestarting and destination locations that avoid the location of the fire sourceand the area where it is spreading. By considering dynamic fire and smokemodels, the proposed system enhances the safety and efficiency of droneoperations in wildfire environments.</description><author>Chang Liu, Tamas Sziranyi</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 14:30:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03521v1</guid></item><item><title>Defense Against Adversarial Attacks using Convolutional Auto-Encoders</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03520v1</link><description>Deep learning models, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on manytasks, are susceptible to adversarial attacks that exploit inherentvulnerabilities in their architectures.

An Interpretability Illusion for Subspace Activation Patching</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17030v2</link><description>Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand model behaviors in terms ofspecific, interpretable features, often hypothesized to manifest aslow-dimensional subspaces of activations. Specifically, recent studies haveexplored subspace interventions (such as activation patching) as a way tosimultaneously manipulate model behavior and attribute the features behind itto given subspaces. In this work, we demonstrate that these two aims diverge, potentially leadingto an illusory sense of interpretability. Counterintuitively, even if asubspace intervention makes the model's output behave as if the value of afeature was changed, this effect may be achieved by activating a dormantparallel pathway leveraging another subspace that is causally disconnected frommodel outputs. We demonstrate this phenomenon in a distilled mathematicalexample, in two real-world domains (the indirect object identification task andfactual recall), and present evidence for its prevalence in practice. In thecontext of factual recall, we further show a link to rank-1 fact editing,providing a mechanistic explanation for previous work observing aninconsistency between fact editing performance and fact localization. However, this does not imply that activation patching of subspaces isintrinsically unfit for interpretability. To contextualize our findings, wealso show what a success case looks like in a task (indirect objectidentification) where prior manual circuit analysis informs an understanding ofthe location of a feature. We explore the additional evidence needed to arguethat a patched subspace is faithful.</description><author>Aleksandar Makelov, Georg Lange, Neel Nanda</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 14:28:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17030v2</guid></item><item><title>Active Wildfires Detection and Dynamic Escape Routes Planning for Humans through Information Fusion between Drones and Satellites</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03519v1</link><description>UAVs are playing an increasingly important role in the field of wildernessrescue by virtue of their flexibility.

While several studies haveattempted to address this issue by reducing the number of score functionevaluations using advanced ODE solvers without fine-tuning, the decreasednumber of denoising iterations misses the opportunity to update fine details,resulting in noticeable quality degradation. In our work, we introduce anadvanced acceleration technique that leverages the temporal redundancy inherentin diffusion models. Reusing feature maps with high temporal similarity opensup a new opportunity to save computation without sacrificing output quality. Torealize the practical benefits of this intuition, we conduct an extensiveanalysis and propose a novel method, FRDiff.

It applies a constant penalty coefficientuniformly across all parameters. This may be unnecessarily restrictive for someparameters, while insufficiently restricting others. To dynamically adjustpenalty coefficients for different parameter groups, we present constrainedparameter regularization (CPR) as an alternative to traditional weight decay.Instead of applying a single constant penalty to all parameters, we enforce anupper bound on a statistical measure (e.g., the L$_2$-norm) of parametergroups. Consequently, learning becomes a constraint optimization problem, whichwe address by an adaptation of the augmented Lagrangian method. CPR onlyrequires two hyperparameters and incurs no measurable runtime overhead.Additionally, we propose a simple but efficient mechanism to adapt the upperbounds during the optimization. We provide empirical evidence of CPR's efficacyin experiments on the "grokking" phenomenon, computer vision, and languagemodeling tasks. Our results demonstrate that CPR counteracts the effects ofgrokking and consistently matches or outperforms traditional weight decay.</description><author>Jörg K. H.

The predominant approach of fitting a large neural network and thenpruning it to a reduced size has commonly neglected shortcomings. The producedsurrogate models often will not capture the sensitivities and uncertaintiesinherent in the original model. In particular, (higher-order) derivativeinformation of such surrogates could differ drastically. Given a large enoughnetwork, we expect this derivative information to match. However, the prunedmodel will almost certainly not share this behavior. In this paper, we propose to find surrogate models by using sensitivityinformation throughout the learning and pruning process. We build on work usingInterval Adjoint Significance Analysis for pruning and combine it with therecent advancements in Sobolev Training to accurately model the originalsensitivity information in the pruned neural network based surrogate model. Weexperimentally underpin the method on an example of pricing a multidimensionalBasket option modelled through a stochastic differential equation with Brownianmotion. The proposed method is, however, not limited to the domain ofquantitative finance, which was chosen as a case study for intuitiveinterpretations of the sensitivities.

Subsequently, the LLM's policy is fine-tuned byoptimizing it to maximize the reward model through a reinforcement learningalgorithm. However, an inherent limitation of current reward models is theirinability to fully represent the richness of human preferences and theirdependency on the sampling distribution. In this study, we introduce an alternative pipeline for the fine-tuning ofLLMs using pairwise human feedback. Our approach entails the initial learningof a preference model, which is conditioned on two inputs given a prompt,followed by the pursuit of a policy that consistently generates responsespreferred over those generated by any competing policy, thus defining the Nashequilibrium of this preference model. We term this approach Nash learning fromhuman feedback (NLHF). In the context of a tabular policy representation, we present a novelalgorithmic solution, Nash-MD, founded on the principles of mirror descent.This algorithm produces a sequence of policies, with the last iterationconverging to the regularized Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we exploreparametric representations of policies and introduce gradient descentalgorithms for deep-learning architectures. To demonstrate the effectiveness ofour approach, we present experimental results involving the fine-tuning of aLLM for a text summarization task. We believe NLHF offers a compelling avenuefor preference learning and policy optimization with the potential of advancingthe field of aligning LLMs with human preferences.</description><author>Rémi Munos, Michal Valko, Daniele Calandriello, Mohammad Gheshlaghi Azar, Mark Rowland, Zhaohan Daniel Guo, Yunhao Tang, Matthieu Geist, Thomas Mesnard, Andrea Michi, Marco Selvi, Sertan Girgin, Nikola Momchev, Olivier Bachem, Daniel J.
