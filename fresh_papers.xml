However, these structures face challenges in datareduction, leading to over-subtraction from speckles and self-subtraction withmost existing methods. Iterative post-processing methods offer promisingresults, but their integration into existing pipelines is hindered by selectivealgorithms, high computational cost, and algorithmic regularization. To addressthis for reference differential imaging (RDI), here we propose the dataimputation concept to Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform (DIKL) by modifying two stepsin the standard Karhunen-Lo\`eve image projection (KLIP) method. Specifically,we partition an image to two matrices: an anchor matrix which focuses only onthe speckles to obtain the DIKL coefficients, and a boat matrix which focuseson the regions of astrophysical interest for speckle removal using DIKLcomponents. As an analytical approach, DIKL achieves high-quality results withsignificantly reduced computational cost (~3 orders of magnitude less thaniterative methods). Being a derivative method of KLIP, DIKL is seamlesslyintegrable into high contrast imaging pipelines for RDI observations.</description><author>Bin B.

Incontrast to behavior cloning, which assumes the data is collected from expertdemonstrations, offline RL can work with non-expert data and multimodalbehavior policies. However, offline RL algorithms face challenges in handlingdistribution shifts and effectively representing policies due to the lack ofonline interaction during training. Prior work on offline RL uses conditionaldiffusion models to represent multimodal behavior in the dataset. Nevertheless,these methods are not tailored toward alleviating the out-of-distribution stategeneralization. We introduce a novel method, named State Reconstruction forDiffusion Policies (SRDP), incorporating state reconstruction feature learningin the recent class of diffusion policies to address the out-of-distributiongeneralization problem. State reconstruction loss promotes more descriptiverepresentation learning of states to alleviate the distribution shift incurredby the out-of-distribution (OOD) states. We design a novel 2D MultimodalContextual Bandit environment to illustrate the OOD generalization of SRDPcompared to prior algorithms. In addition, we assess the performance of ourmodel on D4RL continuous control benchmarks, namely the navigation of an 8-DoFant and forward locomotion of half-cheetah, hopper, and walker2d, achievingstate-of-the-art results.</description><author>Suzan Ece Ada, Erhan Oztop, Emre Ugur</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 18:59:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04726v2</guid></item><item><title>PointLLM: Empowering Large Language Models to Understand Point Clouds</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16911v1</link><description>The unprecedented advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have created aprofound impact on natural language processing but are yet to fully embrace therealm of 3D understanding. This paper introduces PointLLM, a preliminary effortto fill this gap, thereby enabling LLMs to understand point clouds and offeringa new avenue beyond 2D visual data. PointLLM processes colored object pointclouds with human instructions and generates contextually appropriateresponses, illustrating its grasp of point clouds and common sense.Specifically, it leverages a point cloud encoder with a powerful LLM toeffectively fuse geometric, appearance, and linguistic information. We collecta novel dataset comprising 660K simple and 70K complex point-text instructionpairs to enable a two-stage training strategy: initially aligning latent spacesand subsequently instruction-tuning the unified model. To rigorously evaluateour model's perceptual abilities and its generalization capabilities, weestablish two benchmarks: Generative 3D Object Classification and 3D ObjectCaptioning, assessed through three different methods, including humanevaluation, GPT-4/ChatGPT evaluation, and traditional metrics. Experimentresults show that PointLLM demonstrates superior performance over existing 2Dbaselines. Remarkably, in human-evaluated object captioning tasks, PointLLMoutperforms human annotators in over 50% of the samples.

To address this challenge, researchers have used pretrained StyleGANimage generators for high-quality frame synthesis and focused on motiongenerator design. The motion generator is trained in an autoregressive mannerusing heavy 3D convolutional discriminators to ensure motion coherence duringvideo generation. In this paper, we introduce a novel motion generator designthat uses a learning-based inversion network for GAN. The encoder in our methodcaptures rich and smooth priors from encoding images to latents, and given thelatent of an initially generated frame as guidance, our method can generatesmooth future latent by modulating the inversion encoder temporally. Our methodenjoys the advantage of sparse training and naturally constrains the generationspace of our motion generator with the inversion network guided by the initialframe, eliminating the need for heavy discriminators. Moreover, our methodsupports style transfer with simple fine-tuning when the encoder is paired witha pretrained StyleGAN generator. Extensive experiments conducted on variousbenchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method in generating long andhigh-resolution videos with decent single-frame quality and temporalconsistency.</description><author>Yuhan Wang, Liming Jiang, Chen Change Loy</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 18:59:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16909v1</guid></item><item><title>Fine-Grained Cross-View Geo-Localization Using a Correlation-Aware Homography Estimator</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16906v1</link><description>In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to fine-grained cross-viewgeo-localization. Our method aligns a warped ground image with a correspondingGPS-tagged satellite image covering the same area using homography estimation.We first employ a differentiable spherical transform, adhering to geometricprinciples, to accurately align the perspective of the ground image with thesatellite map. This transformation effectively places ground and aerial imagesin the same view and on the same plane, reducing the task to an image alignmentproblem. To address challenges such as occlusion, small overlapping range, andseasonal variations, we propose a robust correlation-aware homography estimatorto align similar parts of the transformed ground image with the satelliteimage. Our method achieves sub-pixel resolution and meter-level GPS accuracy bymapping the center point of the transformed ground image to the satellite imageusing a homography matrix and determining the orientation of the ground camerausing a point above the central axis. Operating at a speed of 30 FPS, ourmethod outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, reducing the mean metriclocalization error by 21.3% and 32.4% in same-area and cross-areageneralization tasks on the VIGOR benchmark, respectively, and by 34.4% on theKITTI benchmark in same-area evaluation.</description><author>Xiaolong Wang, Runsen Xu, Zuofan Cui, Zeyu Wan, Yu Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 18:59:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16906v1</guid></item><item><title>InterDiff: Generating 3D Human-Object Interactions with Physics-Informed Diffusion</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16905v1</link><description>This paper addresses a novel task of anticipating 3D human-objectinteractions (HOIs). Most existing research on HOI synthesis lackscomprehensive whole-body interactions with dynamic objects, e.g., often limitedto manipulating small or static objects. Our task is significantly morechallenging, as it requires modeling dynamic objects with various shapes,capturing whole-body motion, and ensuring physically valid interactions. Tothis end, we propose InterDiff, a framework comprising two key steps: (i)interaction diffusion, where we leverage a diffusion model to encode thedistribution of future human-object interactions; (ii) interaction correction,where we introduce a physics-informed predictor to correct denoised HOIs in adiffusion step. Our key insight is to inject prior knowledge that theinteractions under reference with respect to contact points follow a simplepattern and are easily predictable. Experiments on multiple human-objectinteraction datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for this task,capable of producing realistic, vivid, and remarkably long-term 3D HOIpredictions.</description><author>Sirui Xu, Zhengyuan Li, Yu-Xiong Wang, Liang-Yan Gui</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 18:59:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16905v1</guid></item><item><title>A Note on Randomized Kaczmarz Algorithm for Solving Doubly-Noisy Linear Systems</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16904v1</link><description>Large-scale linear systems, $Ax=b$, frequently arise in practice and demandeffective iterative solvers. Often, these systems are noisy due to operationalerrors or faulty data-collection processes. In the past decade, the randomizedKaczmarz (RK) algorithm has been studied extensively as an efficient iterativesolver for such systems. However, the convergence study of RK in the noisyregime is limited and considers measurement noise in the right-hand sidevector, $b$. Unfortunately, in practice, that is not always the case; thecoefficient matrix $A$ can also be noisy. In this paper, we analyze theconvergence of RK for noisy linear systems when the coefficient matrix, $A$, iscorrupted with both additive and multiplicative noise, along with the noisyvector, $b$. In our analyses, the quantity $\tilde R=\| \tilde A^{\dagger}\|_2^2 \|\tilde A \|_F^2$ influences the convergence of RK, where $\tilde A$represents a noisy version of $A$. We claim that our analysis is robust andrealistically applicable, as we do not require information about the noiselesscoefficient matrix, $A$, and considering different conditions on noise, we cancontrol the convergence of RK. We substantiate our theoretical findings byperforming comprehensive numerical experiments.</description><author>El Houcine Bergou, Soumia Boucherouite, Aritra Dutta, Xin Li, Anna Ma</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 18:59:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16904v1</guid></item><item><title>Motion Matters: Neural Motion Transfer for Better Camera Physiological Measurement</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12059v3</link><description>Machine learning models for camera-based physiological measurement can haveweak generalization due to a lack of representative training data. Body motionis one of the most significant sources of noise when attempting to recover thesubtle cardiac pulse from a video. We explore motion transfer as a form of dataaugmentation to introduce motion variation while preserving physiologicalchanges of interest. We adapt a neural video synthesis approach to augmentvideos for the task of remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) and study the effectsof motion augmentation with respect to 1) the magnitude and 2) the type ofmotion. After training on motion-augmented versions of publicly availabledatasets, we demonstrate a 47% improvement over existing inter-dataset resultsusing various state-of-the-art methods on the PURE dataset. We also presentinter-dataset results on five benchmark datasets to show improvements of up to79% using TS-CAN, a neural rPPG estimation method. Our findings illustrate theusefulness of motion transfer as a data augmentation technique for improvingthe generalization of models for camera-based physiological sensing. We releaseour code for using motion transfer as a data augmentation technique on threepublicly available datasets, UBFC-rPPG, PURE, and SCAMPS, and modelspre-trained on motion-augmented data here: https://motion-matters.github.io/</description><author>Akshay Paruchuri, Xin Liu, Yulu Pan, Shwetak Patel, Daniel McDuff, Soumyadip Sengupta</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 18:58:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12059v3</guid></item><item><title>Learning to Taste: A Multimodal Wine Dataset</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16900v1</link><description>We present WineSensed, a large multimodal wine dataset for studying therelations between visual perception, language, and flavor. The datasetencompasses 897k images of wine labels and 824k reviews of wines curated fromthe Vivino platform. It has over 350k unique vintages, annotated with year,region, rating, alcohol percentage, price, and grape composition. We obtainedfine-grained flavor annotations on a subset by conducting a wine-tastingexperiment with 256 participants who were asked to rank wines based on theirsimilarity in flavor, resulting in more than 5k pairwise flavor distances.

The attention layer within thetransformer admits a sequence of input tokens $X$ and makes them interactthrough pairwise similarities computed as softmax$(XQK^\top X^\top)$, where$(K,Q)$ are the trainable key-query parameters. In this work, we establish aformal equivalence between the optimization geometry of self-attention and ahard-margin SVM problem that separates optimal input tokens from non-optimaltokens using linear constraints on the outer-products of token pairs. Thisformalism allows us to characterize the implicit bias of 1-layer transformersoptimized with gradient descent: (1) Optimizing the attention layer withvanishing regularization, parameterized by $(K,Q)$, converges in direction toan SVM solution minimizing the nuclear norm of the combined parameter$W=KQ^\top$. Instead, directly parameterizing by $W$ minimizes a Frobenius normobjective. We characterize this convergence, highlighting that it can occurtoward locally-optimal directions rather than global ones. (2) Complementingthis, we prove the local/global directional convergence of gradient descentunder suitable geometric conditions. Importantly, we show thatover-parameterization catalyzes global convergence by ensuring the feasibilityof the SVM problem and by guaranteeing a benign optimization landscape devoidof stationary points. (3) While our theory applies primarily to linearprediction heads, we propose a more general SVM equivalence that predicts theimplicit bias with nonlinear heads. Our findings are applicable to arbitrarydatasets and their validity is verified via experiments. We also introduceseveral open problems and research directions. We believe these findingsinspire the interpretation of transformers as a hierarchy of SVMs thatseparates and selects optimal tokens.</description><author>Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Christos Thrampoulidis, Samet Oymak</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 18:57:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16898v1</guid></item><item><title>PointOcc: Cylindrical Tri-Perspective View for Point-based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16896v1</link><description>Semantic segmentation in autonomous driving has been undergoing an evolutionfrom sparse point segmentation to dense voxel segmentation, where the objectiveis to predict the semantic occupancy of each voxel in the concerned 3D space.The dense nature of the prediction space has rendered existing efficient2D-projection-based methods (e.g., bird's eye view, range view, etc.)ineffective, as they can only describe a subspace of the 3D scene. To addressthis, we propose a cylindrical tri-perspective view to represent point cloudseffectively and comprehensively and a PointOcc model to process themefficiently. Considering the distance distribution of LiDAR point clouds, weconstruct the tri-perspective view in the cylindrical coordinate system formore fine-grained modeling of nearer areas. We employ spatial group pooling tomaintain structural details during projection and adopt 2D backbones toefficiently process each TPV plane. Finally, we obtain the features of eachpoint by aggregating its projected features on each of the processed TPV planeswithout the need for any post-processing. Extensive experiments on both 3Doccupancy prediction and LiDAR segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that theproposed PointOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance with much faster speed.Specifically, despite only using LiDAR, PointOcc significantly outperforms allother methods, including multi-modal methods, with a large margin on theOpenOccupancy benchmark.

EMDB is a novel dataset that contains high-quality 3D SMPLpose and shape parameters with global body and camera trajectories forin-the-wild videos. We use body-worn, wireless electromagnetic (EM) sensors anda hand-held iPhone to record a total of 58 minutes of motion data, distributedover 81 indoor and outdoor sequences and 10 participants. Together withaccurate body poses and shapes, we also provide global camera poses and bodyroot trajectories. To construct EMDB, we propose a multi-stage optimizationprocedure, which first fits SMPL to the 6-DoF EM measurements and then refinesthe poses via image observations. To achieve high-quality results, we leveragea neural implicit avatar model to reconstruct detailed human surface geometryand appearance, which allows for improved alignment and smoothness via a densepixel-level objective. Our evaluations, conducted with a multi-view volumetriccapture system, indicate that EMDB has an expected accuracy of 2.3 cmpositional and 10.6 degrees angular error, surpassing the accuracy of previousin-the-wild datasets.

At times, it is desired (e.g.manipulation and grasping), and at times, it is harmful (e.g. when avoidingobstacles). However, traditional path planning algorithms focus solely oncollision-free paths, limiting their applicability in contact-rich tasks. Toaddress this limitation, we propose the domain of Language-Conditioned PathPlanning, where contact-awareness is incorporated into the path planningproblem. As a first step in this domain, we propose Language-ConditionedCollision Functions (LACO) a novel approach that learns a collision functionusing only a single-view image, language prompt, and robot configuration. LACOpredicts collisions between the robot and the environment, enabling flexible,conditional path planning without the need for manual object annotations, pointcloud data, or ground-truth object meshes. In both simulation and the realworld, we demonstrate that LACO can facilitate complex, nuanced path plans thatallow for interaction with objects that are safe to collide, rather thanprohibiting any collision.</description><author>Amber Xie, Youngwoon Lee, Pieter Abbeel, Stephen James</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 18:56:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16893v1</guid></item><item><title>ReZero: Region-customizable Sound Extraction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16892v1</link><description>We introduce region-customizable sound extraction (ReZero), a general andflexible framework for the multi-channel region-wise sound extraction (R-SE)task. R-SE task aims at extracting all active target sounds (e.g., humanspeech) within a specific, user-defined spatial region, which is different fromconventional and existing tasks where a blind separation or a fixed, predefinedspatial region are typically assumed. The spatial region can be defined as anangular window, a sphere, a cone, or other geometric patterns. Being a solutionto the R-SE task, the proposed ReZero framework includes (1) definitions ofdifferent types of spatial regions, (2) methods for region feature extractionand aggregation, and (3) a multi-channel extension of the band-split RNN(BSRNN) model specified for the R-SE task. We design experiments for differentmicrophone array geometries, different types of spatial regions, andcomprehensive ablation studies on different system configurations.

To achieve this goal, the robot needs to have acomprehensive understanding of the 3D structure and semantics of the scene. Inthis work, we present $\textbf{GNFactor}$, a visual behavior cloning agent formulti-task robotic manipulation with $\textbf{G}$eneralizable $\textbf{N}$euralfeature $\textbf{F}$ields. GNFactor jointly optimizes a generalizable neuralfield (GNF) as a reconstruction module and a Perceiver Transformer as adecision-making module, leveraging a shared deep 3D voxel representation.

However, current assessments mainly focus onrecognizing and reasoning abilities, lacking direct evaluation ofconversational skills and neglecting visual storytelling abilities. In thispaper, we propose an evaluation method that uses strong LLMs as judges tocomprehensively evaluate the various abilities of LVLMs. Firstly, we constructa comprehensive visual dialogue dataset TouchStone, consisting of open-worldimages and questions, covering five major categories of abilities and 27subtasks. This dataset not only covers fundamental recognition andcomprehension but also extends to literary creation. Secondly, by integratingdetailed image annotations we effectively transform the multimodal inputcontent into a form understandable by LLMs. This enables us to employ advancedLLMs for directly evaluating the quality of the multimodal dialogue withoutrequiring human intervention. Through validation, we demonstrate that powerfulLVLMs, such as GPT-4, can effectively score dialogue quality by leveragingtheir textual capabilities alone, aligning with human preferences. We hope ourwork can serve as a touchstone for LVLMs' evaluation and pave the way forbuilding stronger LVLMs. The evaluation code is available athttps://github.com/OFA-Sys/TouchStone.</description><author>Shuai Bai, Shusheng Yang, Jinze Bai, Peng Wang, Xingxuan Zhang, Junyang Lin, Xinggang Wang, Chang Zhou, Jingren Zhou</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 18:52:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16890v1</guid></item><item><title>StyleGAN as a Utility-Preserving Face De-identification Method</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02611v2</link><description>Face de-identification methods have been proposed to preserve users' privacyby obscuring their faces. These methods, however, can degrade the quality ofphotos, and they usually do not preserve the utility of faces, i.e., their age,gender, pose, and facial expression. Recently, GANs, such as StyleGAN, havebeen proposed, which generate realistic, high-quality imaginary faces. In thispaper, we investigate the use of StyleGAN in generating de-identified facesthrough style mixing. We examined this de-identification method for preservingutility and privacy by implementing several face detection, verification, andidentification attacks and conducting a user study. The results from ourextensive experiments, human evaluation, and comparison with twostate-of-the-art methods, i.e., CIAGAN and DeepPrivacy, show that StyleGANperforms on par or better than these methods, preserving users' privacy andimages' utility. In particular, the results of the machine learning-basedexperiments show that StyleGAN0-4 preserves utility better than CIAGAN andDeepPrivacy while preserving privacy at the same level. StyleGAN0-3 preservesutility at the same level while providing more privacy. In this paper, for thefirst time, we also performed a carefully designed user study to examine bothprivacy and utility-preserving properties of StyleGAN0-3, 0-4, and 0-5, as wellas CIAGAN and DeepPrivacy from the human observers' perspectives. Ourstatistical tests showed that participants tend to verify and identifyStyleGAN0-5 images more easily than DeepPrivacy images. All the methods butStyleGAN0-5 had significantly lower identification rates than CIAGAN. Regardingutility, as expected, StyleGAN0-5 performed significantly better in preservingsome attributes. Among all methods, on average, participants believe gender hasbeen preserved the most while naturalness has been preserved the least.</description><author>Seyyed Mohammad Sadegh Moosavi Khorzooghi, Shirin Nilizadeh</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 18:51:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02611v2</guid></item><item><title>Federated Learning in UAV-Enhanced Networks: Joint Coverage and Convergence Time Optimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16889v1</link><description>Federated learning (FL) involves several devices that collaboratively train ashared model without transferring their local data. FL reduces thecommunication overhead, making it a promising learning method in UAV-enhancedwireless networks with scarce energy resources. Despite the potential,implementing FL in UAV-enhanced networks is challenging, as conventional UAVplacement methods that maximize coverage increase the FL delay significantly.Moreover, the uncertainty and lack of a priori information about crucialvariables, such as channel quality, exacerbate the problem. In this paper, wefirst analyze the statistical characteristics of a UAV-enhanced wireless sensornetwork (WSN) with energy harvesting. We then develop a model and solutionbased on the multi-objective multi-armed bandit theory to maximize the networkcoverage while minimizing the FL delay. Besides, we propose another solutionthat is particularly useful with large action sets and strict energyconstraints at the UAVs. Our proposal uses a scalarized best-arm identificationalgorithm to find the optimal arms that maximize the ratio of the expectedreward to the expected energy cost by sequentially eliminating one or more armsin each round. Then, we derive the upper bound on the error probability of ourmulti-objective and cost-aware algorithm.

Thestrategy exploits the separation of characteristic times between coarse-grainedparticle evolution on the monomer scale and slow morphological evolution overmesoscopic scales. In contrast to empirical continuum models, the proposedapproach learns stochastically driven defect annihilation processes directlyfrom particle-based simulations. A UNet architecture that respects differentboundary conditions is adopted, thereby allowing periodic and fixed substrateboundary conditions of arbitrary shape. Physical concepts are also introducedvia the loss function and symmetries are incorporated via data augmentation.The model is validated using three different use cases. Explainable artificialintelligence methods are applied to visualize the morphology evolution overtime. This approach enables the generation of large system sizes and longtrajectories to investigate defect densities and their evolution underdifferent types of confinement. As an application, we demonstrate theimportance of accessing late-stage morphologies for understanding particlediffusion inside a single block.

The questions were carefullycurated to discriminate between models with different levels of generallanguage comprehension. The English dataset on its own proves difficult enoughto challenge state-of-the-art language models. Being fully parallel, thisdataset enables direct comparison of model performance across all languages. Weuse this dataset to evaluate the capabilities of multilingual masked languagemodels (MLMs) and large language models (LLMs). We present extensive resultsand find that despite significant cross-lingual transfer in English-centricLLMs, much smaller MLMs pretrained on balanced multilingual data stillunderstand far more languages. We also observe that larger vocabulary size andconscious vocabulary construction correlate with better performance onlow-resource languages. Overall, Belebele opens up new avenues for evaluatingand analyzing the multilingual capabilities of NLP systems.</description><author>Lucas Bandarkar, Davis Liang, Benjamin Muller, Mikel Artetxe, Satya Narayan Shukla, Donald Husa, Naman Goyal, Abhinandan Krishnan, Luke Zettlemoyer, Madian Khabsa</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 18:43:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16884v1</guid></item><item><title>Seeking Interpretability and Explainability in Binary Activated Neural Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03450v2</link><description>We study the use of binary activated neural networks as interpretable andexplainable predictors in the context of regression tasks on tabular data; morespecifically, we provide guarantees on their expressiveness, present anapproach based on the efficient computation of SHAP values for quantifying therelative importance of the features, hidden neurons and even weights.

The question of which one can adapt most quickly to a domain shiftis of significant importance in many fields. Specifically, consider an originaldistribution p that changes due to an unknown intervention, resulting in amodified distribution p*. In aligning p with p*, several factors can affect theadaptation rate, including the causal dependencies between variables in p. Inreal-life scenarios, however, we have to consider the fairness of the trainingprocess, and it is particularly crucial to involve a sensitive variable (bias)present between a cause and an effect variable. To explore this scenario, weexamine a simple structural causal model (SCM) with a cause-bias-effectstructure, where variable A acts as a sensitive variable between cause (X) andeffect (Y). The two models, respectively, exhibit consistent and contrarycause-effect directions in the cause-bias-effect SCM. After conducting unknowninterventions on variables within the SCM, we can simulate some kinds of domainshifts for analysis. We then compare the adaptation speeds of two models acrossfour shift scenarios. Additionally, we prove the connection between theadaptation speeds of the two models across all interventions.</description><author>Yujie Lin, Chen Zhao, Minglai Shao, Xujiang Zhao, Haifeng Chen</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 18:36:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16879v1</guid></item><item><title>SportsSloMo: A New Benchmark and Baselines for Human-centric Video Frame Interpolation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16876v1</link><description>Human-centric video frame interpolation has great potential for improvingpeople's entertainment experiences and finding commercial applications in thesports analysis industry, e.g., synthesizing slow-motion videos. Although thereare multiple benchmark datasets available in the community, none of them isdedicated for human-centric scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduceSportsSloMo, a benchmark consisting of more than 130K video clips and 1M videoframes of high-resolution ($\geq$720p) slow-motion sports videos crawled fromYouTube. We re-train several state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, and theresults show a decrease in their accuracy compared to other datasets. Ithighlights the difficulty of our benchmark and suggests that it posessignificant challenges even for the best-performing methods, as human bodiesare highly deformable and occlusions are frequent in sports videos. To improvethe accuracy, we introduce two loss terms considering the human-aware priors,where we add auxiliary supervision to panoptic segmentation and human keypointsdetection, respectively. The loss terms are model agnostic and can be easilyplugged into any video frame interpolation approaches. Experimental resultsvalidate the effectiveness of our proposed loss terms, leading to consistentperformance improvement over 5 existing models, which establish strong baselinemodels on our benchmark.

Despite recent progress in documenting thisproblem and many attempts at mitigating it, we still lack shared methodologyand tooling to report gender representation in large datasets. Suchquantitative reporting will enable further mitigation, e.g., via dataaugmentation. This paper describes the Gender-GAP Pipeline (for Gender-AwarePolyglot Pipeline), an automatic pipeline to characterize gender representationin large-scale datasets for 55 languages. The pipeline uses a multilinguallexicon of gendered person-nouns to quantify the gender representation in text.We showcase it to report gender representation in WMT training data anddevelopment data for the News task, confirming that current data is skewedtowards masculine representation.

The innatevariability in the transportation system makes it exceptionally challenging toexpose AVs to all possible driving scenarios during empirical experimentationor testing. Consequently, AVs could be blind to certain encounters that aredeemed detrimental to their safe and efficient operation. It is then criticalto share knowledge across AVs that increase exposure to driving scenariosoccurring in the real world. This paper explores a method to collaborativelytrain a driver model by sharing knowledge and borrowing strength acrossvehicles while retaining a personalized model tailored to the vehicle's uniqueconditions and properties. Our model brings a federated learning approach tocollaborate between multiple vehicles while circumventing the need to share rawdata between them. We showcase our method's performance in experimentalsimulations. Such an approach to learning finds several applications acrosstransportation engineering including intelligent transportation systems,traffic management, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication.

In this work, we start with anon-autonomous ODE and build neural networks using a suitable,structure-preserving, numerical time-discretisation. The structure of theneural network is then inferred from the properties of the ODE vector field.Besides injecting more structure into the network architectures, this modellingprocedure allows a better theoretical understanding of their behaviour.

Hence, predictinginflammatory disease activity is crucial for disease assessment and treatment.However, MS lesions can occur throughout the brain and vary in shape, size andtotal count among patients. The high variance in lesion load and locationsmakes it challenging for machine learning methods to learn a globally effectiverepresentation of whole-brain MRI scans to assess and predict disease.Technically it is non-trivial to incorporate essential biomarkers such aslesion load or spatial proximity. Our work represents the first attempt toutilize graph neural networks (GNN) to aggregate these biomarkers for a novelglobal representation. We propose a two-stage MS inflammatory disease activityprediction approach. First, a 3D segmentation network detects lesions, and aself-supervised algorithm extracts their image features. Second, the detectedlesions are used to build a patient graph. The lesions act as nodes in thegraph and are initialized with image features extracted in the first stage.Finally, the lesions are connected based on their spatial proximity and theinflammatory disease activity prediction is formulated as a graphclassification task. Furthermore, we propose a self-pruning strategy toauto-select the most critical lesions for prediction. Our proposed methodoutperforms the existing baseline by a large margin (AUCs of 0.67 vs. 0.61 and0.66 vs. 0.60 for one-year and two-year inflammatory disease activity,respectively). Finally, our proposed method enjoys inherent explainability byassigning an importance score to each lesion for the overall prediction.

The sample complexity of learning a DAG'sstructure is well-studied for static systems, where the samples of nodal statesare independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). However, such a study isless explored for DAGs with dynamical systems, where the nodal states aretemporally correlated. We call such a DAG underlying an LDS as \emph{dynamical}DAG (DDAG). In particular, we consider a DDAG where the nodal dynamics aredriven by unobserved exogenous noise sources that are wide-sense stationary(WSS) in time but are mutually uncorrelated, and have the same {power spectraldensity (PSD)}. Inspired by the static settings, a metric and an algorithmbased on the PSD matrix of the observed time series are proposed to reconstructthe DDAG. The equal noise PSD assumption can be relaxed such thatidentifiability conditions for DDAG reconstruction are not violated. For theLDS with WSS (sub) Gaussian exogenous noise sources, it is shown that theoptimal sample complexity (or length of state trajectory) needed to learn theDDAG is $n=\Theta(q\log(p/q))$, where $p$ is the number of nodes and $q$ is themaximum number of parents per node. To prove the sample complexity upper bound,a concentration bound for the PSD estimation is derived, under two differentsampling strategies. A matching min-max lower bound using generalized Fano'sinequality also is provided, thus showing the order optimality of the proposedalgorithm.</description><author>Mishfad Shaikh Veedu, Deepjyoti Deka, Murti V.

In scenarios where explicit hypergraphs arenot readily available, it is desirable to infer a meaningful hypergraphstructure from the node features to capture the intrinsic relations within thedata. However, existing methods either adopt simple pre-defined rules that failto precisely capture the distribution of the potential hypergraph structure, orlearn a mapping between hypergraph structures and node features but require alarge amount of labelled data, i.e., pre-existing hypergraph structures, fortraining. Both restrict their applications in practical scenarios. To fill thisgap, we propose a novel smoothness prior that enables us to design a method toinfer the probability for each potential hyperedge without labelled data assupervision. The proposed prior indicates features of nodes in a hyperedge arehighly correlated by the features of the hyperedge containing them. We use thisprior to derive the relation between the hypergraph structure and the nodefeatures via probabilistic modelling. This allows us to develop an unsupervisedinference method to estimate the probability for each potential hyperedge viasolving an optimisation problem that has an analytical solution. Experiments onboth synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can learnmeaningful hypergraph structures from data more efficiently than existinghypergraph structure inference methods.</description><author>Bohan Tang, Siheng Chen, Xiaowen Dong</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 17:57:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14172v2</guid></item><item><title>Humans in 4D: Reconstructing and Tracking Humans with Transformers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20091v3</link><description>We present an approach to reconstruct humans and track them over time.

Formany real-world applications, which often require high-resolution data points,training time and memory usage are significant bottlenecks. While there aremixed-precision training techniques for standard neural networks, those workfor real-valued datatypes on finite dimensions and therefore cannot be directlyapplied to FNO, which crucially operates in the (complex-valued) Fourier domainand in function spaces. On the other hand, since the Fourier transform isalready an approximation (due to discretization error), we do not need toperform the operation at full precision. In this work, we (i) profile memoryand runtime for FNO with full and mixed-precision training, (ii) conduct astudy on the numerical stability of mixed-precision training of FNO, and (iii)devise a training routine which substantially decreases training time andmemory usage (up to 34%), with little or no reduction in accuracy, on theNavier-Stokes and Darcy flow equations.

Previousstudies have proposed machine learning-based methods to predict received signalstrength for future time periods using time series of depth images to mitigatethe line-of-sight (LOS) path blockage by pedestrians in mmWave communication.However, these image-based methods have limited applicability due to privacyconcerns as camera images may contain sensitive information. This studyproposes a point cloud-based method for mmWave link quality prediction anddemonstrates its feasibility through experiments. Point clouds representthree-dimensional (3D) spaces as a set of points and are sparser and lesslikely to contain sensitive information than camera images. Additionally, pointclouds provide 3D position and motion information, which is necessary forunderstanding the radio propagation environment involving pedestrians. Thisstudy designs the mmWave link quality prediction method and conducts realisticindoor experiments, where the link quality fluctuates significantly due tohuman blockage, using commercially available IEEE 802.11ad-based 60 GHzwireless LAN devices and Kinect v2 RGB-D camera and Velodyne VLP-16 lightdetection and ranging (LiDAR) for point cloud acquisition. The experimentalresults showed that our proposed method can predict future large attenuation ofmmWave received signal strength and throughput induced by the LOS path blockageby pedestrians with comparable or superior accuracy to image-based predictionmethods.

Whenmaking personalized predictions, a model can combine two types of trends: (a)trends shared across people, i.e., person-generic trends, such as being happieron weekends, and (b) unique trends for each person, i.e., person-specifictrends, such as a stressful weekly meeting. Mixed effect models are popularstatistical models to study both trends by combining person-generic andperson-specific parameters. Though linear mixed effect models are gainingpopularity in machine learning by integrating them with neural networks, theseintegrations are currently limited to linear person-specific parameters: rulingout nonlinear person-specific trends. In this paper, we propose Neural MixedEffect (NME) models to optimize nonlinear person-specific parameters anywherein a neural network in a scalable manner. NME combines the efficiency of neuralnetwork optimization with nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Empirically, weobserve that NME improves performance across six unimodal and multimodaldatasets, including a smartphone dataset to predict daily mood and amother-adolescent dataset to predict affective state sequences where half themothers experience at least moderate symptoms of depression. Furthermore, weevaluate NME for two model architectures, including for neural conditionalrandom fields (CRF) to predict affective state sequences where the CRF learnsnonlinear person-specific temporal transitions between affective states.Analysis of these person-specific transitions on the mother-adolescent datasetshows interpretable trends related to the mother's depression symptoms.</description><author>Torsten Wörtwein, Nicholas Allen, Lisa B.

Based on the main architecture of recently proposed VISinger, weput forward several specific designs for expressive singing voice synthesis.First, different from the previous SVS models, we use text representation oflyrics extracted from pre-trained BERT as additional input to the model. Therepresentation contains information about semantics of the lyrics, which couldhelp SVS system produce more expressive and natural voice. Second, we furtherintroduce an energy predictor to stabilize the synthesized voice and model thewider range of energy variations that also contribute to the expressiveness ofsinging voice. Last but not the least, to attenuate the off-key issues, thepitch predictor is re-designed to predict the real to note pitch ratio.

Moreover, the parameter server needs to wait for theslowest client (i.e., straggler, which may have the largest model size, lowestcomputing capability or worst network condition) to upload parameters, whichmay significantly degrade the communication efficiency. Commonly-used clientselection methods such as partial client selection would lead to the waste ofcomputing resources and weaken the generalization of the global model. Totackle this problem, along a different line, in this paper, we advocate theapproach of model parameter dropout instead of client selection, andaccordingly propose a novel framework of Federated learning scheme withDifferential parameter Dropout (FedDD). FedDD consists of two key modules:dropout rate allocation and uploaded parameter selection, which will optimizethe model parameter uploading ratios tailored to different clients'heterogeneous conditions and also select the proper set of important modelparameters for uploading subject to clients' dropout rate constraints.Specifically, the dropout rate allocation is formulated as a convexoptimization problem, taking system heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, andmodel heterogeneity among clients into consideration. The uploaded parameterselection strategy prioritizes on eliciting important parameters for uploadingto speedup convergence. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the convergenceof the proposed FedDD scheme. Extensive performance evaluations demonstratethat the proposed FedDD scheme can achieve outstanding performances in bothcommunication efficiency and model convergence, and also possesses a stronggeneralization capability to data of rare classes.</description><author>Zhiying Feng, Xu Chen, Qiong Wu, Wen Wu, Xiaoxi Zhang, Qianyi Huang</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 17:10:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16835v1</guid></item><item><title>Neural ShDF: Reviving an Efficient and Consistent Mesh Segmentation Method</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11737v2</link><description>Partitioning a polygonal mesh into meaningful parts can be challenging. Manyapplications require decomposing such structures for further processing incomputer graphics. In the last decade, several methods were proposed to tacklethis problem, at the cost of intensive computational times. Recently, machinelearning has proven to be effective for the segmentation task on 3D structures.Nevertheless, these state-of-the-art methods are often hardly generalizable andrequire dividing the learned model into several specific classes of objects toavoid overfitting. We present a data-driven approach leveraging deep learningto encode a mapping function prior to mesh segmentation for multipleapplications. Our network reproduces a neighborhood map using our knowledge ofthe \textsl{Shape Diameter Function} (SDF) method using similarities amongvertex neighborhoods. Our approach is resolution-agnostic as we downsample theinput meshes and query the full-resolution structure solely for neighborhoodcontributions. Using our predicted SDF values, we can inject the resultingstructure into a graph-cut algorithm to generate an efficient and robust meshsegmentation while considerably reducing the required computation times.</description><author>Bruno Roy</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 16:57:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11737v2</guid></item><item><title>Coarse-to-Fine Amodal Segmentation with Shape Prior</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16825v1</link><description>Amodal object segmentation is a challenging task that involves segmentingboth visible and occluded parts of an object. In this paper, we propose a novelapproach, called Coarse-to-Fine Segmentation (C2F-Seg), that addresses thisproblem by progressively modeling the amodal segmentation. C2F-Seg initiallyreduces the learning space from the pixel-level image space to thevector-quantized latent space. This enables us to better handle long-rangedependencies and learn a coarse-grained amodal segment from visual features andvisible segments. However, this latent space lacks detailed information aboutthe object, which makes it difficult to provide a precise segmentationdirectly. To address this issue, we propose a convolution refine module toinject fine-grained information and provide a more precise amodal objectsegmentation based on visual features and coarse-predicted segmentation. Tohelp the studies of amodal object segmentation, we create a synthetic amodaldataset, named as MOViD-Amodal (MOViD-A), which can be used for both image andvideo amodal object segmentation. We extensively evaluate our model on twobenchmark datasets: KINS and COCO-A. Our empirical results demonstrate thesuperiority of C2F-Seg. Moreover, we exhibit the potential of our approach forvideo amodal object segmentation tasks on FISHBOWL and our proposed MOViD-A.Project page at: http://jianxgao.github.io/C2F-Seg.</description><author>Jianxiong Gao, Xuelin Qian, Yikai Wang, Tianjun Xiao, Tong He, Zheng Zhang, Yanwei Fu</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 16:56:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16825v1</guid></item><item><title>Can Programming Languages Boost Each Other via Instruction Tuning?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16824v1</link><description>When human programmers have mastered a programming language, it would beeasier when they learn a new programming language.

In such applications, adverse conditions(heavy rain, night time, snow, extreme lighting) on the one hand pose specificchallenges, yet are typically underrepresented in the available datasets.Generating more training data is cumbersome and expensive, and the processitself is error-prone due to the inherent aleatoric uncertainty. To addressthis challenging problem, we propose BTSeg, which exploits image-levelcorrespondences as weak supervision signal to learn a segmentation model thatis agnostic to adverse conditions. To this end, our approach uses the Barlowtwins loss from the field of unsupervised learning and treats images taken atthe same location but under different adverse conditions as "augmentations" ofthe same unknown underlying base image. This allows the training of asegmentation model that is robust to appearance changes introduced by differentadverse conditions. We evaluate our approach on ACDC and the new challengingACG benchmark to demonstrate its robustness and generalization capabilities.Our approach performs favorably when compared to the current state-of-the-artmethods, while also being simpler to implement and train.

However, due to the irregular traffic time seriesproduced by intelligent intersections, the traffic forecasting task becomesmuch more intractable and imposes three major new challenges: 1) asynchronousspatial dependency, 2) irregular temporal dependency among traffic data, and 3)variable-length sequence to be predicted, which severely impede the performanceof current traffic forecasting methods. To this end, we propose an AsynchronousSpatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) to predict the trafficstates of the lanes entering intelligent intersections in a future time window.Specifically, by linking lanes via a traffic diffusion graph, we first proposean Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to model the asynchronous spatialdependency between the time-misaligned traffic state measurements of lanes.After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic statesequence, a learnable personalized time encoding is devised to embed thecontinuous time for each lane. Then we propose a Transformable Time-awareConvolution Network that learns meta-filters to derive time-aware convolutionfilters with transformable filter sizes for efficient temporal convolution onthe irregular sequence. Furthermore, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Networkconsisting of a state evolution unit and a semiautoregressive predictor isdesigned to effectively and efficiently predict variable-length traffic statesequences.

Informative log-likelihood evaluation locations are selected usinga sequential experimental design strategy until the MH accept/reject decisionis done accurately enough according to the GP model. The resulting approximatesampler is conceptually simple and sample-efficient. It is also more robust toviolations of GP modelling assumptions compared with earlier, related "Bayesianoptimisation-like" methods tailored for Bayesian inference.

Recently, multiscale graphs have been developed to modelthe human body at higher abstraction levels, resulting in more stable motionprediction. Current methods however predetermine scale levels and combinespatially proximal joints to generate coarser scales based on human priors,even though movement patterns in different motion sequences vary and do notfully comply with a fixed graph of spatially connected joints. Another problemwith graph convolutional methods is mode collapse, in which predicted posesconverge around a mean pose with no discernible movements, particularly inlong-term predictions. To tackle these issues, we propose ResChunk, anend-to-end network which explores dynamically correlated body components basedon the pairwise relationships between all joints in individual sequences.ResChunk is trained to learn the residuals between target sequence chunks in anautoregressive manner to enforce the temporal connectivities betweenconsecutive chunks. It is hence a sequence-to-sequence prediction network whichconsiders dynamic spatio-temporal features of sequences at multiple levels.

We show the prevalence ofinvariant subspaces, demonstrating a fixed relative behavior that is unaffectedby feature transformations. Our work clarifies recent observations related toconvergence to a constant state and a potential over-separation of node states,as the amplification of subspaces only depends on the spectrum of theaggregation function. In linear scenarios, this leads to node representationsbeing dominated by a low-dimensional subspace with an asymptotic convergencerate independent of the feature transformations. This causes a rank collapse ofthe node representations, resulting in over-smoothing when smooth vectors spanthis subspace, and over-correlation even when over-smoothing is avoided. Guidedby our theory, we propose a sum of Kronecker products as a beneficial propertythat can provably prevent over-smoothing, over-correlation, and rank collapse.We empirically extend our insights to the non-linear case, demonstrating theinability of existing models to capture linearly independent features.</description><author>Andreas Roth, Thomas Liebig</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 16:22:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16800v1</guid></item><item><title>Simple LLM Prompting is State-of-the-Art for Robust and Multilingual Dialogue Evaluation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16797v1</link><description>Despite significant research effort in the development of automatic dialogueevaluation metrics, little thought is given to evaluating dialogues other thanin English.

Specifically, the teacher first maps its data into a k-ordersimplicial complex and learns its high-order correlations. For effectivecommunication and inference, the teacher seeks minimally sufficient andinvariant semantic structures prior to conveying information. These minimalsimplicial structures are found via judiciously removing simplices selected bythe Hodge Laplacians without compromising the inference query accuracy.Subsequently, the student locally runs its own set of queries based on a maskedsimplicial convolutional autoencoder (SCAE) leveraging both local and remoteteacher's knowledge. Numerical results corroborate the effectiveness of theproposed approach in terms of improving inference query accuracy underdifferent channel conditions and simplicial structures. Experiments on acoauthorship dataset show that removing simplices by ranking the Laplacianvalues yields a 85% reduction in payload size without sacrificing accuracy.Joint semantic communication and inference by masked SCAE improves queryaccuracy by 25% compared to local student based query and 15% compared toremote teacher based query.

Current zero-shotmethods mainly focus on using pre-trained discriminative models (e.g., CLIP).However, we have observed that generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) havepotentially understood the relationships between various visual elements andtext descriptions, which are rarely investigated in this task. In this work, weintroduce a novel Referring Diffusional segmentor (Ref-Diff) for this task,which leverages the fine-grained multi-modal information from generativemodels. We demonstrate that without a proposal generator, a generative modelalone can achieve comparable performance to existing SOTA weakly-supervisedmodels. When we combine both generative and discriminative models, our Ref-Diffoutperforms these competing methods by a significant margin. This indicatesthat generative models are also beneficial for this task and can complementdiscriminative models for better referring segmentation.

Theseindicators, achieved by representing feed-forward structures as componentgraphs through one-hot encoding, face a limitation: their inability to evaluatearchitecture performance across varying search spaces. In contrast, handcraftedperformance indicators (zero-shot NAS), which use the same architecture withrandom initialization, can generalize across multiple search spaces. Addressingthis limitation, we propose a novel approach for zero-shot NAS using deeplearning. Our method employs Fourier sum of sines encoding for convolutionalkernels, enabling the construction of a computational feed-forward graph with astructure similar to the architecture under evaluation. These encodings arelearnable and offer a comprehensive view of the architecture's topologicalinformation. An accompanying multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then ranks thesearchitectures based on their encodings. Experimental results show that ourapproach surpasses previous methods using graph convolutional networks in termsof correlation on the NAS-Bench-201 dataset and exhibits a higher convergencerate. Moreover, our extracted feature representation trained on eachNAS-Benchmark is transferable to other NAS-Benchmarks, showing promisinggeneralizability across multiple search spaces.

In SNNs, delays refer to the timeneeded for one spike to travel from one neuron to another. These delays matterbecause they influence the spike arrival times, and it is well-known thatspiking neurons respond more strongly to coincident input spikes. Moreformally, it has been shown theoretically that plastic delays greatly increasethe expressivity in SNNs. Yet, efficient algorithms to learn these delays havebeen lacking. Here, we propose a new discrete-time algorithm that addressesthis issue in deep feedforward SNNs using backpropagation, in an offlinemanner. To simulate delays between consecutive layers, we use 1D convolutionsacross time. The kernels contain only a few non-zero weights - one per synapse- whose positions correspond to the delays. These positions are learnedtogether with the weights using the recently proposed Dilated Convolution withLearnable Spacings (DCLS). We evaluated our method on three datasets: theSpiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD), the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) and itsnon-spiking version Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC) benchmarks, whichrequire detecting temporal patterns. We used feedforward SNNs with two or threehidden fully connected layers, and vanilla leaky integrate-and fire neurons.

This paper develops aregion-based radio map from received signal strength (RSS) measurements withoutlocation labels. The construction is based on a set of blindly collected RSSmeasurement data from a device that visits each region in an indoor areaexactly once, where the footprints and timestamps are not recorded. The mainchallenge is to cluster the RSS data and match clusters with the physicalregions. Classical clustering algorithms fail to work as the RSS data naturallyappears as non-clustered due to multipaths and noise. In this paper, a signalsubspace model with a sequential prior is constructed for the RSS data, and anintegrated segmentation and clustering algorithm is developed, which is shownto find the globally optimal solution in a special case. Furthermore, theclustered data is matched with the physical regions using a graph-basedapproach. Based on real measurements from an office space, the proposed schemereduces the region localization error by roughly 50% compared to a weightedcentroid localization (WCL) baseline, and it even outperforms some supervisedlocalization schemes, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vectormachine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN), which require labeled data fortraining.</description><author>Zheng Xing, Junting Chen</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 15:27:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16759v1</guid></item><item><title>Towards High-Fidelity Text-Guided 3D Face Generation and Manipulation Using only Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16758v1</link><description>Generating 3D faces from textual descriptions has a multitude ofapplications, such as gaming, movie, and robotics.

However, due to the limited text-3D face data pairs,text-driven 3D face generation remains an open problem. In this paper, wepropose a text-guided 3D faces generation method, refer as TG-3DFace, forgenerating realistic 3D faces using text guidance. Specifically, we adopt anunconditional 3D face generation framework and equip it with text conditions,which learns the text-guided 3D face generation with only text-2D face data. Ontop of that, we propose two text-to-face cross-modal alignment techniques,including the global contrastive learning and the fine-grained alignmentmodule, to facilitate high semantic consistency between generated 3D faces andinput texts. Besides, we present directional classifier guidance during theinference process, which encourages creativity for out-of-domain generations.Compared to the existing methods, TG-3DFace creates more realistic andaesthetically pleasing 3D faces, boosting 9% multi-view consistency (MVIC) overLatent3D.

Queries are typically rewritten duringquery processing time for better query modelling for the downstream ranker.With the advent of large-language models (LLMs), there have been initialinvestigations into using generative approaches to generate pseudo documents totackle this inherent vocabulary gap. In this work, we analyze the utility ofLLMs for improved query rewriting for text ranking tasks. We find that thereare two inherent limitations of using LLMs as query re-writers -- concept driftwhen using only queries as prompts and large inference costs during queryprocessing. We adopt a simple, yet surprisingly effective, approach calledcontext aware query rewriting (CAR) to leverage the benefits of LLMs for queryunderstanding. Firstly, we rewrite ambiguous training queries by context-awareprompting of LLMs, where we use only relevant documents as context.Unlikeexisting approaches, we use LLM-based query rewriting only during the trainingphase. Eventually, a ranker is fine-tuned on the rewritten queries instead ofthe original queries during training. In our extensive experiments, we findthat fine-tuning a ranker using re-written queries offers a significantimprovement of up to 33% on the passage ranking task and up to 28% on thedocument ranking task when compared to the baseline performance of usingoriginal queries.</description><author>Abhijit Anand, Venktesh V, Vinay Setty, Avishek Anand</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 15:19:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16753v1</guid></item><item><title>Moreau Envelope ADMM for Decentralized Weakly Convex Optimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16752v1</link><description>This paper proposes a proximal variant of the alternating direction method ofmultipliers (ADMM) for distributed optimization.

However, these methods heavily rely on trainingwith simulated data, as obtaining paired metal artifact CT and clean CT data inclinical settings is challenging. This limitation can lead to decreasedperformance when applying these methods in clinical practice. Existingunsupervised MAR methods, whether based on learning or not, typically operatewithin a single domain, either in the image domain or the sinogram domain. Inthis paper, we propose an unsupervised MAR method based on the diffusion model,a generative model with a high capacity to represent data distributions.Specifically, we first train a diffusion model using CT images without metalartifacts. Subsequently, we iteratively utilize the priors embedded within thepre-trained diffusion model in both the sinogram and image domains to restorethe degraded portions caused by metal artifacts. This dual-domain processingempowers our approach to outperform existing unsupervised MAR methods,including another MAR method based on the diffusion model, which we havequalitatively and quantitatively validated using synthetic datasets.

Despite their success in gait recognition for in-the-lab environments,they usually fail in real-world scenarios due to their low information entropyfor gait representations. To achieve accurate gait recognition in the wild,this paper presents a novel gait representation, named Gait Parsing Sequence(GPS). GPSs are sequences of fine-grained human segmentation, i.e., humanparsing, extracted from video frames, so they have much higher informationentropy to encode the shapes and dynamics of fine-grained human parts duringwalking. Moreover, to effectively explore the capability of the GPSrepresentation, we propose a novel human parsing-based gait recognitionframework, named ParsingGait. ParsingGait contains a Convolutional NeuralNetwork (CNN)-based backbone and two light-weighted heads. The first headextracts global semantic features from GPSs, while the other one learns mutualinformation of part-level features through Graph Convolutional Networks tomodel the detailed dynamics of human walking.

Post-Deployment Adaptation (PDA) addressesthis by tailoring a pre-trained, deployed model to the target data distributionusing limited labelled or entirely unlabelled target data, while assuming noaccess to source training data as they cannot be deployed with the model due toprivacy concerns and their large size. This makes reliable adaptationchallenging due to limited learning signal. This paper challenges thisassumption and introduces FedPDA, a novel adaptation framework that brings theutility of learning from remote data from Federated Learning into PDA. FedPDAenables a deployed model to obtain information from source data via remotegradient exchange, while aiming to optimize the model specifically for thetarget domain. Tailored for FedPDA, we introduce a novel optimization methodStarAlign (Source-Target Remote Gradient Alignment) that aligns gradientsbetween source-target domain pairs by maximizing their inner product, tofacilitate learning a target-specific model. We demonstrate the method'seffectiveness using multi-center databases for the tasks of cancer metastasesdetection and skin lesion classification, where our method compares favourablyto previous work.

Achieving this goal requires cutting-edge advances in naturallanguage processing, computer vision, and robotics engineering. Thus, thispaper mainly investigates the potential of integrating the most recent LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) and existing visual grounding and robotic graspingsystem to enhance the effectiveness of the human-robot interaction. Weintroduce the WALL-E (Embodied Robotic WAiter load lifting with Large Languagemodel) as an example of this integration. The system utilizes the LLM ofChatGPT to summarize the preference object of the users as a target instructionvia the multi-round interactive dialogue. The target instruction is thenforwarded to a visual grounding system for object pose and size estimation,following which the robot grasps the object accordingly. We deploy thisLLM-empowered system on the physical robot to provide a more user-friendlyinterface for the instruction-guided grasping task. The further experimentalresults on various real-world scenarios demonstrated the feasibility andefficacy of our proposed framework.

As more data becomes available and modelarchitectures become more complex, the need for more computational powerincreases. On the other hand, since the introduction of Bitcoin as the firstcryptocurrency and the establishment of the concept of blockchain as adistributed ledger, many variants and approaches have been proposed. However,many of them have one thing in common, which is the Proof of Work (PoW)consensus mechanism. PoW is mainly used to support the process of new blockgeneration. While PoW has proven its robustness, its main drawback is that itrequires a significant amount of processing power to maintain the security andintegrity of the blockchain. This is due to applying brute force to solve ahashing puzzle. To utilize the computational power available in useful andmeaningful work while keeping the blockchain secure, many techniques have beenproposed, one of which is known as Proof of Deep Learning (PoDL). PoDL is aconsensus mechanism that uses the process of training a deep learning model asproof of work to add new blocks to the blockchain. In this paper, we survey thevarious approaches for PoDL. We discuss the different types of PoDL algorithms,their advantages and disadvantages, and their potential applications. We alsodiscuss the challenges of implementing PoDL and future research directions.</description><author>Mahmoud Salhab, Khaleel Mershad</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 14:49:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16730v1</guid></item><item><title>Adaptive Uncertainty-Guided Model Selection for Data-Driven PDE Discovery</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10283v2</link><description>We propose a new parameter-adaptive uncertainty-penalized Bayesianinformation criterion (UBIC) to prioritize the parsimonious partialdifferential equation (PDE) that sufficiently governs noisy spatial-temporalobserved data with few reliable terms.

Recently, deep learning based terrain generation hasemerged, notably the ones based on generative adversarial networks (GAN).However, these methods often struggle to fulfill the requirements of flexibleuser control and maintain generative diversity for realistic terrain.Therefore, we propose a novel diffusion-based method, namely terrain diffusionnetwork (TDN), which actively incorporates user guidance for enhancedcontrollability, taking into account terrain features like rivers, ridges,basins, and peaks. Instead of adhering to a conventional monolithic denoisingprocess, which often compromises the fidelity of terrain details or thealignment with user control, a multi-level denoising scheme is proposed togenerate more realistic terrains by taking into account fine-grained details,particularly those related to climatic patterns influenced by erosion andtectonic activities. Specifically, three terrain synthesisers are designed forstructural, intermediate, and fine-grained level denoising purposes, whichallow each synthesiser concentrate on a distinct terrain aspect. Moreover, tomaximise the efficiency of our TDN, we further introduce terrain and sketchlatent spaces for the synthesizers with pre-trained terrain autoencoders.Comprehensive experiments on a new dataset constructed from NASA TopologyImages clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achievingthe state-of-the-art performance.

However, this idealistic assumption may not alwayshold due to potential annotation inaccuracies, meaning the ground-truth may notbe present in the candidate label set. This is known as Unreliable PartialLabel Learning (UPLL) that introduces an additional complexity due to theinherent unreliability and ambiguity of partial labels, often resulting in asub-optimal performance with existing methods. To address this challenge, wepropose the Unreliability-Robust Representation Learning framework (URRL) thatleverages unreliability-robust contrastive learning to help the model fortifyagainst unreliable partial labels effectively. Concurrently, we propose a dualstrategy that combines KNN-based candidate label set correction andconsistency-regularization-based label disambiguation to refine label qualityand enhance the ability of representation learning within the URRL framework.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperformsstate-of-the-art PLL methods on various datasets with diverse degrees ofunreliability and ambiguity.

But what makes a good IML model? The answer lies in the wayto capture artifacts. Exploiting artifacts requires the model to extractnon-semantic discrepancies between manipulated and authentic regions,necessitating explicit comparisons between the two areas. With theself-attention mechanism, naturally, the Transformer should be a bettercandidate to capture artifacts. However, due to limited datasets, there iscurrently no pure ViT-based approach for IML to serve as a benchmark, and CNNsdominate the entire task. Nevertheless, CNNs suffer from weak long-range andnon-semantic modeling. To bridge this gap, based on the fact that artifacts aresensitive to image resolution, amplified under multi-scale features, andmassive at the manipulation border, we formulate the answer to the formerquestion as building a ViT with high-resolution capacity, multi-scale featureextraction capability, and manipulation edge supervision that could convergewith a small amount of data. We term this simple but effective ViT paradigmIML-ViT, which has significant potential to become a new benchmark for IML.Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets verified our model outperformsthe state-of-the-art manipulation localization methods.Code and models areavailable at \url{https://github.com/SunnyHaze/IML-ViT}.</description><author>Xiaochen Ma, Bo Du, Zhuohang Jiang, Ahmed Y.

In human-centeredapplications, like skin lesion classification in dermatology, DL-drivenclinical decision support systems are still in their infancy due to the limitedtransparency of their decision-making process. Moreover, the lack of proceduresthat can explain the behavior of trained DL algorithms leads to almost no trustfrom clinical physicians. To diagnose skin lesions, dermatologists rely onvisual assessment of the disease and the data gathered from the patient'sanamnesis. Data-driven algorithms dealing with multi-modal data are limited bythe separation of feature-level and decision-level fusion procedures requiredby convolutional architectures. To address this issue, we enable single-stagemulti-modal data fusion via the attention mechanism of transformer-basedarchitectures to aid in diagnosing skin diseases. Our method beats otherstate-of-the-art single- and multi-modal DL architectures in image-rich andpatient-data-rich environments.

The main goalof an attacker is to steal as much information as possible about a protectedvictim model, so that he can mimic it with a substitute model, even with alimited access to similar training data. Recently, physical attacks such asfault injection have shown worrying efficiency against the integrity andconfidentiality of embedded models. We focus on embedded deep neural networkmodels on 32-bit microcontrollers, a widespread family of hardware platforms inIoT, and the use of a standard fault injection strategy - Safe Error Attack(SEA) - to perform a model extraction attack with an adversary having a limitedaccess to training data. Since the attack strongly depends on the inputqueries, we propose a black-box approach to craft a successful attack set. Fora classical convolutional neural network, we successfully recover at least 90%of the most significant bits with about 1500 crafted inputs. These informationenable to efficiently train a substitute model, with only 8% of the trainingdataset, that reaches high fidelity and near identical accuracy level than thevictim model.</description><author>Kevin Hector, Pierre-Alain Moellic, Mathieu Dumont, Jean-Max Dutertre</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 14:09:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16703v1</guid></item><item><title>Invertible normalizing flow neural networks by JKO scheme</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14424v2</link><description>Normalizing flow is a class of deep generative models for efficient samplingand density estimation.

Thecurrent paper develops a neural ODE flow network inspired by theJordan-Kinderleherer-Otto (JKO) scheme, which allows efficient block-wisetraining of the residual blocks without sampling SDE trajectories or innerloops of score matching or variational learning. As the JKO scheme unfolds thedynamic of gradient flow, the proposed model naturally stacks residual networkblocks one by one, reducing the memory load and difficulty in performingend-to-end deep flow network training. We also develop adaptive timereparameterization of the flow network with a progressive refinement of thetrajectory in probability space, which improves the model training efficiencyand accuracy in practice. Using numerical experiments with synthetic and realdata, we show that the proposed JKO-iFlow model achieves similar or betterperformance in generating new samples compared with the existing flow anddiffusion models at a significantly reduced computational and memory cost.</description><author>Chen Xu, Xiuyuan Cheng, Yao Xie</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 14:06:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14424v2</guid></item><item><title>USAGE: A Unified Seed Area Generation Paradigm for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07806v2</link><description>Seed area generation is usually the starting point of weakly supervisedsemantic segmentation (WSSS). Computing the Class Activation Map (CAM) from amulti-label classification network is the de facto paradigm for seed areageneration, but CAMs generated from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) andTransformers are prone to be under- and over-activated, respectively, whichmakes the strategies to refine CAMs for CNNs usually inappropriate forTransformers, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose a Unified optimizationparadigm for Seed Area GEneration (USAGE) for both types of networks, in whichthe objective function to be optimized consists of two terms: One is ageneration loss, which controls the shape of seed areas by a temperatureparameter following a deterministic principle for different types of networks;The other is a regularization loss, which ensures the consistency between theseed areas that are generated by self-adaptive network adjustment fromdifferent views, to overturn false activation in seed areas. Experimentalresults show that USAGE consistently improves seed area generation for bothCNNs and Transformers by large margins, e.g., outperforming state-of-the-artmethods by a mIoU of 4.1% on PASCAL VOC. Moreover, based on the USAGE-generatedseed areas on Transformers, we achieve state-of-the-art WSSS results on bothPASCAL VOC and MS COCO.</description><author>Zelin Peng, Guanchun Wang, Lingxi Xie, Dongsheng Jiang, Wei Shen, Qi Tian</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 14:00:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07806v2</guid></item><item><title>SpeechTokenizer: Unified Speech Tokenizer for Speech Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16692v1</link><description>Current speech large language models build upon discrete speechrepresentations, which can be categorized into semantic tokens and acoustictokens.
