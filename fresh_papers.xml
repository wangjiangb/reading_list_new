The dataset contains 28K unique short videoscenarios, and 419K annotations. Evaluating state-of-the-art vision-languagemodels on our benchmark shows that their performance is below humancapabilities, with GPT-4V responding truthfully to 59.6% of the questionscompared to 96.6% for humans. For evaluation, we propose a truthfulnessclassifier, called Lingo-Judge, that achieves a 0.95 Spearman correlationcoefficient to human evaluations, surpassing existing techniques like METEOR,BLEU, CIDEr, and GPT-4. We establish a baseline vision-language model and runextensive ablation studies to understand its performance. We release ourdataset and benchmark as an evaluation platform for vision-language models inautonomous driving.</description><author>Ana-Maria Marcu, Long Chen, Jan Hünermann, Alice Karnsund, Benoit Hanotte, Prajwal Chidananda, Saurabh Nair, Vijay Badrinarayanan, Alex Kendall, Jamie Shotton, Elahe Arani, Oleg Sinavski</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 15:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14115v4</guid></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating API-oriented Code Generation in Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15228v3</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have emerged aspowerful tools for code generation, significantly enhancing productivity andaccelerating software development. However, existing benchmarks primarily focuson general code generation without considering API-oriented code generation,i.e., generating code that invokes APIs from specific libraries. Given thegrowing demand for API-oriented code generation, there is a pressing need for asystematic and automated approach to evaluate LLM on API-oriented codegeneration. To address this gap, we propose AutoAPIEval, a lightweight andautomated framework designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs inAPI-oriented code generation. Our framework works with any library thatprovides API documentation and focuses on two unit tasks: API recommendationand code example generation, along with four metrics to evaluate the generatedAPIs and code examples, such as the proportion of incorrect API recommendationsfor Task 1, and the proportion of code examples where no specific API isinvoked and uncompilable/unexecutable code examples for Task 2. In addition, weconducted a case study on three LLMs (ChatGPT, MagiCoder, and DeepSeek Coder)and Java Runtime Environment 8 to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness.Our findings reveal substantial variability in LLM performance across tasks,with ChatGPT adhering better to instructions, while sharing similareffectiveness in code example generation with its counterparts (i.e., MagiCoderand DeekSeek Coder). We also identify key factors associated with code quality,such as API popularity and model confidence, and build classifiers that achievehigh accuracy in detecting incorrect API recommendations and erroneous codeexamples. Retrieval-augmented generation enhances the quality of code generatedby LLMs, though its effectiveness varies across different LLMs.</description><author>Yixi Wu, Pengfei He, Zehao Wang, Shaowei Wang, Yuan Tian, Tse-Hsun Chen</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 14:57:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15228v3</guid></item><item><title>Opponent Shaping for Antibody Development</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10588v5</link><description>Anti-viral therapies are typically designed to target the current strains ofa virus. Game theoretically, this corresponds to a short-sighted, or myopic,response. However, therapy-induced selective pressures act on viral antigens todrive the emergence of mutated strains, against which initial therapies havereduced efficacy. Building on a computational model of binding betweenantibodies and viral antigens (the Absolut! framework), we design and implementa genetic simulation of such viral evolutionary escape. Crucially, this allowsour antibody optimisation algorithm to consider and influence the entire escapecurve of the virus, i.e. to guide (or ''shape'') the viral evolution. This isinspired by opponent shaping which, in general-sum learning, accounts for theadaptation of the co-player rather than playing a myopic best response. Hencewe call the optimised antibodies shapers. Within our simulations, wedemonstrate that our shapers target both current and simulated future viralvariants, outperforming the antibodies chosen in a myopic way. Furthermore, weshow that shapers exert specific evolutionary pressure on the virus compared tomyopic antibodies. Altogether, shapers modify the evolutionary trajectories ofviral strains and minimise the viral escape compared to their myopiccounterparts. While this is a simplified model, we hope that our proposedparadigm will enable the discovery of better long-lived vaccines and antibodytherapies in the future, enabled by rapid advancements in the capabilities ofsimulation tools.

These regions emerge duringtraining and become more defined as training progresses or model sizeincreases. The regions appear to be much larger than previously studiedpolytopes. Our analysis suggests that these stable regions align with semanticdistinctions, where similar prompts cluster within regions, and activationsfrom the same region lead to similar next token predictions.

However, this field faces two major challenges:first, the data from the two domains are often unpaired, making it difficult totrain generative adversarial networks effectively; second, existing methodstend to produce artifacts or hallucinations during image generation, leading toa decline in image quality. To address these issues, this paper proposes anenhanced unsupervised image-to-image translation method based on theContrastive Unpaired Translation (CUT) model, incorporating Histogram ofOriented Gradients (HOG) features. This novel approach ensures the preservationof the semantic structure of images, even without semantic labels, byminimizing the loss between the HOG features of input and generated images. Themethod was tested on translating synthetic game environments from GTA5 datasetto realistic urban scenes in cityscapes dataset, demonstrating significantimprovements in reducing hallucinations and enhancing image quality.</description><author>Wanchen Zhao</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 13:18:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16042v2</guid></item><item><title>Scenario of Use Scheme: Threat Model Specification for Speaker Privacy Protection in the Medical Domain</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16106v2</link><description>Speech recordings are being more frequently used to detect and monitordisease, leading to privacy concerns. Beyond cryptography, protection of speechcan be addressed by approaches, such as perturbation, disentanglement, andre-synthesis, that eliminate sensitive information of the speaker, leaving theinformation necessary for medical analysis purposes. In order for such privacyprotective approaches to be developed, clear and systematic specifications ofassumptions concerning medical settings and the needs of medical professionalsare necessary. In this paper, we propose a Scenario of Use Scheme thatincorporates an Attacker Model, which characterizes the adversary against whomthe speaker's privacy must be defended, and a Protector Model, which specifiesthe defense. We discuss the connection of the scheme with previous work onspeech privacy. Finally, we present a concrete example of a specified Scenarioof Use and a set of experiments about protecting speaker data against genderinference attacks while maintaining utility for Parkinson's detection.</description><author>Mehtab Ur Rahman, Martha Larson, Louis ten Bosch, Cristian Tejedor-García</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 13:05:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16106v2</guid></item><item><title>Interpretable Vision-Language Survival Analysis with Ordinal Inductive Bias for Computational Pathology</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09369v3</link><description>Histopathology Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) provide an important tool to assesscancer prognosis in computational pathology (CPATH). While existing survivalanalysis (SA) approaches have made exciting progress, they are generallylimited to adopting highly-expressive architectures and only coarse-grainedpatient-level labels to learn prognostic visual representations from gigapixelWSIs. Such learning paradigm suffers from important performance bottlenecks,when facing present scarce training data and standard multi-instance learning(MIL) framework in CPATH. To overcome it, this paper, for the first time,proposes a new Vision-Language-based SA (VLSA) paradigm. Concretely, (1) VLSAis driven by pathology VL foundation models. It no longer relies onhigh-capability networks and shows the advantage of data efficiency. (2) Invision-end, VLSA encodes prognostic language prior and then employs it asauxiliary signals to guide the aggregating of prognostic visual features atinstance level, thereby compensating for the weak supervision in MIL. Moreover,given the characteristics of SA, we propose i) ordinal survival prompt learningto transform continuous survival labels into textual prompts; and ii) ordinalincidence function as prediction target to make SA compatible with VL-basedprediction. Notably, VLSA's predictions can be interpreted intuitively by ourShapley values-based method. The extensive experiments on five datasets confirmthe effectiveness of our scheme. Our VLSA could pave a new way for SA in CPATHby offering weakly-supervised MIL an effective means to learn valuableprognostic clues from gigapixel WSIs.

Recent advancements in largevideo-language models offer the potential for automating SOP generation byanalyzing recordings of human demonstrations. However, current largevideo-language models face challenges with zero-shot SOP generation. We explorein-context learning with video-language models for SOP generation. We reportthat in-context learning sometimes helps video-language models at SOPgeneration. We then propose an in-context ensemble learning to further enhancethe capabilities of the models in SOP generation.</description><author>Moucheng Xu, Evangelos Chatzaroulas, Luc McCutcheon, Abdul Ahad, Hamzah Azeem, Janusz Marecki, Ammar Anwar</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 09:56:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15867v3</guid></item><item><title>EAGLE: Towards Efficient Arbitrary Referring Visual Prompts Comprehension for Multimodal Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16723v2</link><description>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have sparked greatresearch interests owing to their exceptional content-reasoning andinstruction-following capabilities. To effectively instruct an MLLM, inaddition to conventional language expressions, the practice of referring toobjects by painting with brushes on images has emerged as a prevalent tool(referred to as "referring visual prompts") due to its efficacy in aligning theuser's intention with specific image regions. To accommodate the most commonreferring visual prompts, namely points, boxes, and masks, existing approachesinitially utilize specialized feature encoding modules to capture the semanticsof the highlighted areas indicated by these prompts. Subsequently, theseencoded region features are adapted to MLLMs through fine-tuning on ameticulously curated multimodal instruction dataset. However, such designssuffer from redundancy in architecture. Moreover, they face challenges ineffectively generalizing when encountering a diverse range of arbitraryreferring visual prompts in real-life scenarios. To address the above issues,we propose EAGLE, a novel MLLM that empowers comprehension of arbitraryreferring visual prompts with less training efforts than existing approaches.Specifically, our EAGLE maintains the innate format of the referring visualprompts as colored patches rendered on the given image for conducting theinstruction tuning. Our approach embeds referring visual prompts as spatialconcepts conveying specific spatial areas comprehensible to the MLLM, with thesemantic comprehension of these regions originating from the MLLM itself.Besides, we also propose a Geometry-Agnostic Learning paradigm (GAL) to furtherdisentangle the MLLM's region-level comprehension with the specific formats ofreferring visual prompts. Extensive experiments are conducted to prove theeffectiveness of our proposed method.</description><author>Jiacheng Zhang, Yang Jiao, Shaoxiang Chen, Jingjing Chen, Yu-Gang Jiang</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 08:28:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16723v2</guid></item><item><title>Quality Matters: Evaluating Synthetic Data for Tool-Using LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16341v2</link><description>Training large language models (LLMs) for external tool usage is a rapidlyexpanding field, with recent research focusing on generating synthetic data toaddress the shortage of available data. However, the absence of systematic dataquality checks poses complications for properly training and testing models. Tothat end, we propose two approaches for assessing the reliability of data fortraining LLMs to use external tools. The first approach uses intuitive,human-defined correctness criteria. The second approach uses a model-drivenassessment with in-context evaluation. We conduct a thorough evaluation of dataquality on two popular benchmarks, followed by an extrinsic evaluation thatshowcases the impact of data quality on model performance. Our resultsdemonstrate that models trained on high-quality data outperform those trainedon unvalidated data, even when trained with a smaller quantity of data. Thesefindings empirically support the significance of assessing and ensuring thereliability of training data for tool-using LLMs.</description><author>Shadi Iskander, Nachshon Cohen, Zohar Karnin, Ori Shapira, Sofia Tolmach</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 07:54:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16341v2</guid></item><item><title>INT-FlashAttention: Enabling Flash Attention for INT8 Quantization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16997v2</link><description>As the foundation of large language models (LLMs), self-attention modulefaces the challenge of quadratic time and memory complexity with respect tosequence length. FlashAttention accelerates attention computation and reducesits memory usage by leveraging the GPU memory hierarchy. A promising researchdirection is to integrate FlashAttention with quantization methods. This paperintroduces INT-FlashAttention, the first INT8 quantization architecturecompatible with the forward workflow of FlashAttention, which significantlyimproves the inference speed of FlashAttention on Ampere GPUs. We implement ourINT-FlashAttention prototype with fully INT8 activations and generalmatrix-multiplication (GEMM) kernels, making it the first attention operatorwith fully INT8 input. As a general token-level post-training quantizationframework, INT-FlashAttention is also compatible with other data formats likeINT4, etc. Experimental results show INT-FlashAttention achieves 72% fasterinference speed and 82% smaller quantization error compared to standardFlashAttention with FP16 and FP8 data format.</description><author>Shimao Chen, Zirui Liu, Zhiying Wu, Ce Zheng, Peizhuang Cong, Zihan Jiang, Yuhan Wu, Lei Su, Tong Yang</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 06:13:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16997v2</guid></item><item><title>VideoPatchCore: An Effective Method to Memorize Normality for Video Anomaly Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16225v2</link><description>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a crucial task in video analysis andsurveillance within computer vision. Currently, VAD is gaining attention withmemory techniques that store the features of normal frames. The stored featuresare utilized for frame reconstruction, identifying an abnormality when asignificant difference exists between the reconstructed and input frames.However, this approach faces several challenges due to the simultaneousoptimization required for both the memory and encoder-decoder model. Thesechallenges include increased optimization difficulty, complexity ofimplementation, and performance variability depending on the memory size. Toaddress these challenges,we propose an effective memory method for VAD, calledVideoPatchCore. Inspired by PatchCore, our approach introduces a structure thatprioritizes memory optimization and configures three types of memory tailoredto the characteristics of video data. This method effectively addresses thelimitations of existing memory-based methods, achieving good performancecomparable to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our method requires notraining and is straightforward to implement, making VAD tasks more accessible.Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-VideoPatchCore.</description><author>Sunghyun Ahn, Youngwan Jo, Kijung Lee, Sanghyun Park</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 06:04:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16225v2</guid></item><item><title>Regional quality estimation for echocardiography using deep learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00591v4</link><description>Automatic estimation of cardiac ultrasound image quality can be beneficialfor guiding operators and ensuring the accuracy of clinical measurements.Previous work often fails to distinguish the view correctness of theechocardiogram from the image quality. Additionally, previous studies onlyprovide a global image quality value, which limits their practical utility. Inthis work, we developed and compared three methods to estimate image quality:1) classic pixel-based metrics like the generalized contrast-to-noise ratio(gCNR) on myocardial segments as region of interest and left ventricle lumen asbackground, obtained using a U-Net segmentation 2) local image coherencederived from a U-Net model that predicts coherence from B-Mode images 3) a deepconvolutional network that predicts the quality of each region directly in anend-to-end fashion. We evaluate each method against manual regional imagequality annotations by three experienced cardiologists. The results indicatepoor performance of the gCNR metric, with Spearman correlation to theannotations of rho = 0.24. The end-to-end learning model obtains the bestresult, rho = 0.69, comparable to the inter-observer correlation, rho = 0.63.Finally, the coherence-based method, with rho = 0.58, outperformed theclassical metrics and is more generic than the end-to-end approach.

Mitigating Idiosyncrasies and Improving Human-AI Alignment in the Writing Process through Edits</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14509v3</link><description>LLM-based applications are helping people write, and LLM-generated text ismaking its way into social media, journalism, and our classrooms. However, thedifferences between LLM-generated and human-written text remain unclear. Toexplore this, we hired professional writers to edit paragraphs in severalcreative domains. We first found these writers agree on undesirableidiosyncrasies in LLM-generated text, formalizing it into a seven-categorytaxonomy (e.g. cliches, unnecessary exposition). Second, we curated the LAMPcorpus: 1,057 LLM-generated paragraphs edited by professional writers accordingto our taxonomy. Analysis of LAMP reveals that none of the LLMs used in ourstudy (GPT4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1-70b) outperform each other in termsof writing quality, revealing common limitations across model families. Third,we explored automatic editing methods to improve LLM-generated text. Alarge-scale preference annotation confirms that although experts largely prefertext edited by other experts, automatic editing methods show promise inimproving alignment between LLM-generated and human-written text.</description><author>Tuhin Chakrabarty, Philippe Laban, Chien-Sheng Wu</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 03:15:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14509v3</guid></item><item><title>Mitigating Covariate Shift in Imitation Learning for Autonomous Vehicles Using Latent Space Generative World Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16663v2</link><description>We propose the use of latent space generative world models to address thecovariate shift problem in autonomous driving.

However, generating high-quality 3D avatars capable of expressiveanimation remains challenging. In this work, we present DreamWaltz-G, a novellearning framework for animatable 3D avatar generation from text. The core ofthis framework lies in Skeleton-guided Score Distillation and Hybrid 3DGaussian Avatar representation. Specifically, the proposed skeleton-guidedscore distillation integrates skeleton controls from 3D human templates into 2Ddiffusion models, enhancing the consistency of SDS supervision in terms of viewand human pose. This facilitates the generation of high-quality avatars,mitigating issues such as multiple faces, extra limbs, and blurring. Theproposed hybrid 3D Gaussian avatar representation builds on the efficient 3DGaussians, combining neural implicit fields and parameterized 3D meshes toenable real-time rendering, stable SDS optimization, and expressive animation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamWaltz-G is highly effective ingenerating and animating 3D avatars, outperforming existing methods in bothvisual quality and animation expressiveness.

Motivated by text prompting in LLMs, visual promptinghas been explored to enhance LVLMs' capabilities of perceiving visualinformation. However, previous visual prompting techniques solely processvisual inputs without considering text queries, limiting the models' ability tofollow text instructions to complete tasks. To fill this gap, in this work, wepropose a new prompting technique named Attention Prompting on Image, whichjust simply overlays a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the originalinput image and effectively enhances LVLM on various tasks. Specifically, wegenerate an attention heatmap for the input image dependent on the text querywith an auxiliary model like CLIP. Then the heatmap simply multiplies the pixelvalues of the original image to obtain the actual input image for the LVLM.Extensive experiments on various vison-language benchmarks verify theeffectiveness of our technique. For example, Attention Prompting on Imageimproves LLaVA-1.5 by 3.8% and 2.9% on MM-Vet and LLaVA-Wild benchmarks,respectively.</description><author>Runpeng Yu, Weihao Yu, Xinchao Wang</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 17:59:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17143v1</guid></item><item><title>FineZip : Pushing the Limits of Large Language Models for Practical Lossless Text Compression</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17141v1</link><description>While the language modeling objective has been shown to be deeply connectedwith compression, it is surprising that modern LLMs are not employed inpractical text compression systems. In this paper, we provide an in-depthanalysis of neural network and transformer-based compression techniques toanswer this question. We compare traditional text compression systems withneural network and LLM-based text compression methods. Although LLM-basedsystems significantly outperform conventional compression methods, they arehighly impractical. Specifically, LLMZip, a recent text compression systemusing Llama3-8B requires 9.5 days to compress just 10 MB of text, although withhuge improvements in compression ratios. To overcome this, we present FineZip -a novel LLM-based text compression system that combines ideas of onlinememorization and dynamic context to reduce the compression time immensely.FineZip can compress the above corpus in approximately 4 hours compared to 9.5days, a 54 times improvement over LLMZip and comparable performance. FineZipoutperforms traditional algorithmic compression methods with a large margin,improving compression ratios by approximately 50\%. With this work, we take thefirst step towards making lossless text compression with LLMs a reality. WhileFineZip presents a significant step in that direction, LLMs are still not aviable solution for large-scale text compression. We hope our work paves theway for future research and innovation to solve this problem.</description><author>Fazal Mittu, Yihuan Bu, Akshat Gupta, Ashok Devireddy, Alp Eren Ozdarendeli, Anant Singh, Gopala Anumanchipalli</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 17:58:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17141v1</guid></item><item><title>Pre-trained Language Models Do Not Help Auto-regressive Text-to-Image Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16201v2</link><description>Recent advances in image tokenizers, such as VQ-VAE, have enabledtext-to-image generation using auto-regressive methods, similar to languagemodeling.

We provide a two-fold explanation by analyzingtokens from each modality. First, we demonstrate that image tokens possesssignificantly different semantics compared to text tokens, renderingpre-trained language models no more effective in modeling them than randomlyinitialized ones. Second, the text tokens in the image-text datasets are toosimple compared to normal language model pre-training data, which causes thecatastrophic degradation of language models' capability.</description><author>Yuhui Zhang, Brandon McKinzie, Zhe Gan, Vaishaal Shankar, Alexander Toshev</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 17:58:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16201v2</guid></item><item><title>Turn Every Application into an Agent: Towards Efficient Human-Agent-Computer Interaction with API-First LLM-Based Agents</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17140v1</link><description>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled LLM-based agents todirectly interact with application user interfaces (UIs), enhancing agents'performance in complex tasks.

However, the optimization for tasksperformance often comes at the cost of generalizability in fine-tuned models.To address this issue, we theoretically connect smaller weight gradient normsduring training and larger datasets to the improved model generalization.Motivated by this connection, we propose reducing gradient norms for enhancedgeneralization and aligning fine-tuned model with the pre-trained counterpartto retain knowledge from large-scale pre-training data. Yet, naive alignmentdoes not guarantee gradient reduction and can potentially cause gradientexplosion, complicating efforts to manage gradients. To address such issues, wepropose PACE, marrying generalization of PArameter-efficient fine-tuning withConsistency rEgularization. We perturb features learned from the adapter withthe multiplicative noise and ensure the fine-tuned model remains consistent forsame sample under different perturbations. Theoretical analysis shows that PACEnot only implicitly regularizes gradients for enhanced generalization, but alsoimplicitly aligns the fine-tuned and pre-trained models to retain knowledge.Experimental evidence supports our theories.

The ISP is typically proprietary andhandcrafted and consists of several blocks such as white balance, colorcorrection, and tone mapping. Deep learning-based ISPs aim to transform RAWimages into DSLR-like RGB images using deep neural networks. However, mostlearned ISPs are trained using patches (small regions) due to computationallimitations. Such methods lack global context, which limits their efficacy onfull-resolution images and harms their ability to capture global propertiessuch as color constancy or illumination.

Inspired by the rich history of research in industrial''Design for Assembly'', we introduce a novel problem: GenerativeDesign-for-Robot-Assembly (GDfRA). The task is to generate an assembly based ona natural language prompt (e.g., ''giraffe'') and an image of availablephysical components, such as 3D-printed blocks. The output is an assembly, aspatial arrangement of these components, and instructions for a robot to buildthis assembly. The output must 1) resemble the requested object and 2) bereliably assembled by a 6 DoF robot arm with a suction gripper. We then presentBlox-Net, a GDfRA system that combines generative vision language models withwell-established methods in computer vision, simulation, perturbation analysis,motion planning, and physical robot experimentation to solve a class of GDfRAproblems with minimal human supervision. Blox-Net achieved a Top-1 accuracy of63.5% in the ''recognizability'' of its designed assemblies (eg, resemblinggiraffe as judged by a VLM). These designs, after automated perturbationredesign, were reliably assembled by a robot, achieving near-perfect successacross 10 consecutive assembly iterations with human intervention only duringreset prior to assembly.

This system relies on expert pathologists to evaluate samples ofprostate tissue and assign a Gleason grade, a task that requires significanttime and manual effort. To address this challenge, artificial intelligence (AI)solutions have been explored to automate the grading process. In light of thesechallenges, this study evaluates and compares the effectiveness of three deeplearning methodologies, YOLO, Vision Transformers, and Vision Mamba, inaccurately classifying Gleason grades from histopathology images. The goal isto enhance diagnostic precision and efficiency in prostate cancer management.This study utilized two publicly available datasets, Gleason2019 and SICAPv2,to train and test the performance of YOLO, Vision Transformers, and VisionMamba models. Each model was assessed based on its ability to classify Gleasongrades accurately, considering metrics such as false positive rate, falsenegative rate, precision, and recall. The study also examined the computationalefficiency and applicability of each method in a clinical setting. Vision Mambademonstrated superior performance across all metrics, achieving high precisionand recall rates while minimizing false positives and negatives. YOLO showedpromise in terms of speed and efficiency, particularly beneficial for real-timeanalysis. Vision Transformers excelled in capturing long-range dependencieswithin images, although they presented higher computational complexity comparedto the other models.

In this context, the combinationof machine learning and proximity sensors is emerging as a technique capable ofachieving this detection efficiently and effectively. For example, this machinelearning approach has been applied to potato crops -- to detect late blight(Phytophthora infestans) -- and grapevine crops -- to detect downy mildew.However, most of these AI models found in the specialised literature have beendeveloped using leaf-by-leaf images taken in the lab, which does not representfield conditions and limits their applicability. In this study, we present the first machine learning model capable ofdetecting mild symptoms of late blight in potato crops through the analysis ofhigh-resolution RGB images captured directly in the field, overcoming thelimitations of other publications in the literature and presenting real-worldapplicability. Our proposal exploits the availability of high-resolution imagesvia the concept of patching, and is based on deep convolutional neural networkswith a focal loss function, which makes the model to focus on the complexpatterns that arise in field conditions. Additionally, we present a dataaugmentation scheme that facilitates the training of these neural networks withfew high-resolution images, which allows for development of models under thesmall data paradigm. Our model correctly detects all cases of late blight in the test dataset,demonstrating a high level of accuracy and effectiveness in identifying earlysymptoms.

However, these rules lack the flexibility to addressthe unique characteristics of individual example effectively. Meanwhile,applying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts. Inthis paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3Bparameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable tothose of human experts. We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novelframework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models torefine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such asstring normalization, for each individual example at scale. Experimentalresults show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform eitheroriginal data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2%across various downstream benchmarks. Its effectiveness spans various modelsizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, and FineWeb.Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in domain-specific continualpre-training: without domain specific design, models trained on OpenWebMathrefined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based methods, improving averageaccuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for Llama-2-7B and 20.3% forCodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable to models like Llemma-7Btrained on 200B tokens.

However, segmenting biological cells remains challengingdue to the high variability and complexity of cell shapes. Addressing thischallenge requires high-quality datasets that accurately represent the diversemorphologies found in biological cells. Existing cell segmentation datasets areoften limited by their focus on regular and uniform shapes. In this paper, weintroduce a novel benchmark dataset of Ntera-2 (NT2) cells, a pluripotentcarcinoma cell line, exhibiting diverse morphologies across multiple stages ofdifferentiation, capturing the intricate and heterogeneous cellular structuresthat complicate segmentation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose anuncertainty-aware deep learning framework for complex cellular morphologysegmentation (MorphoSeg) by incorporating sampling of virtual outliers fromlow-likelihood regions during training. Our comprehensive experimentalevaluations against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate that MorphoSegsignificantly enhances segmentation accuracy, achieving up to a 7.74% increasein the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and a 28.36% reduction in theHausdorff Distance.

The state-of-the-art forprocessing raw inputs, though, are deep neural networks (DNNs), nowadays oftenbased off from multimodal foundation models. These automatically learn richrepresentations of concepts and respective reasoning. Unfortunately, thelearned qualitative knowledge is opaque, preventing easy inspection,validation, or adaptation against available QR models. So far, it is possibleto associate pre-defined concepts with latent representations of DNNs, butextractable relations are mostly limited to semantic similarity. As a next steptowards QR for validation and verification of DNNs: Concretely, we propose amethod that extracts the learned superclass hierarchy from a multimodal DNN fora given set of leaf concepts. Under the hood we (1) obtain leaf conceptembeddings using the DNN's textual input modality; (2) apply hierarchicalclustering to them, using that DNNs encode semantic similarities via vectordistances; and (3) label the such-obtained parent concepts using search inavailable ontologies from QR. An initial evaluation study shows that meaningfulontological class hierarchies can be extracted from state-of-the-art foundationmodels. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to validate and verify a DNN's learnedrepresentations against given ontologies.

Thedataset contains $\sim170$K models and $\sim660$K text annotations, fromabstract CAD descriptions (e.g., generate two concentric cylinders) to detailedspecifications (e.g., draw two circles with center $(x,y)$ and radius $r_{1}$,$r_{2}$, and extrude along the normal by $d$...). Within the Text2CADframework, we propose an end-to-end transformer-based auto-regressive networkto generate parametric CAD models from input texts. We evaluate the performanceof our model through a mixture of metrics, including visual quality, parametricprecision, and geometrical accuracy. Our proposed framework shows greatpotential in AI-aided design applications.

Despite significant advancements, automatic parametertuning of delay-network models remains an open challenge. We introduce a novelmethod for finding the parameters of a Feedback Delay Network (FDN) such thatits output renders target attributes of a measured room impulse response. Theproposed approach involves the implementation of a differentiable FDN withtrainable delay lines, which, for the first time, allows us to simultaneouslylearn each and every delay-network parameter via backpropagation. The iterativeoptimization process seeks to minimize a perceptually-motivated time-domainloss function incorporating differentiable terms accounting for energy decayand echo density. Through experimental validation, we show that the proposedmethod yields time-invariant frequency-independent FDNs capable of closelymatching the desired acoustical characteristics, and outperforms existingmethods based on genetic algorithms and analytical FDN design.</description><author>Alessandro Ilic Mezza, Riccardo Giampiccolo, Enzo De Sena, Alberto Bernardini</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 17:16:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00082v3</guid></item><item><title>LingoQA: Video Question Answering for Autonomous Driving</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14115v3</link><description>We introduce LingoQA, a novel dataset and benchmark for visual questionanswering in autonomous driving.

Detection-based approaches have until now been largely discardedfor HTR because reading characters separately is often challenging, andcharacter-level annotation is difficult and expensive. We overcome thesechallenges thanks to three main insights: (i) synthetic pre-training withsufficiently diverse data enables learning reasonable character localizationfor any script; (ii) modern transformer-based detectors can jointly detect alarge number of instances, and, if trained with an adequate masking strategy,leverage consistency between the different detections; (iii) once a pre-traineddetection model with approximate character localization is available, it ispossible to fine-tune it with line-level annotation on real data, even with adifferent alphabet. Our approach, dubbed DTLR, builds on a completely differentparadigm than state-of-the-art HTR methods, which rely on autoregressivedecoding, predicting character values one by one, while we treat a completeline in parallel. Remarkably, we demonstrate good performance on a large rangeof scripts, usually tackled with specialized approaches. In particular, weimprove state-of-the-art performances for Chinese script recognition on theCASIA v2 dataset, and for cipher recognition on the Borg and Copiale datasets.Our code and models are available at https://github.com/raphael-baena/DTLR.</description><author>Raphael Baena, Syrine Kalleli, Mathieu Aubry</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 17:05:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17095v1</guid></item><item><title>BitQ: Tailoring Block Floating Point Precision for Improved DNN Efficiency on Resource-Constrained Devices</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17093v1</link><description>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful for cognitive tasks such as imageclassification, object detection, and scene segmentation. One drawback howeveris the significant high computational complexity and memory consumption, whichmakes them unfeasible to run real-time on embedded platforms because of thelimited hardware resources. Block floating point (BFP) quantization is one ofthe representative compression approaches for reducing the memory andcomputational burden owing to their capability to effectively capture the broaddata distribution of DNN models. Unfortunately, prior works on BFP-basedquantization empirically choose the block size and the precision that preserveaccuracy. In this paper, we develop a BFP-based bitwidth-aware analyticalmodeling framework (called ``BitQ'') for the best BFP implementation of DNNinference on embedded platforms. We formulate and resolve an optimizationproblem to identify the optimal BFP block size and bitwidth distribution by thetrade-off of both accuracy and performance loss. Experimental results show thatcompared with an equal bitwidth setting, the BFP DNNs with optimized bitwidthallocation provide efficient computation, preserving accuracy on famousbenchmarks.

For identification error on observed segments, our singledata-driven congestion function compares favorably to segment-specificmodel-based functions on highway roads, but has room to improve on arterialroads.

Due to the redundancy in LLM weights, recentresearch has focused on pushing weight-only quantization to extremely low-bit(even down to 2 bits). It reduces memory requirements, optimizes storage costs,and decreases memory bandwidth needs during inference. However, due tonumerical representation limitations, traditional scalar-based weightquantization struggles to achieve such extreme low-bit. Recent research onVector Quantization (VQ) for LLMs has demonstrated the potential for extremelylow-bit model quantization by compressing vectors into indices using lookuptables. In this paper, we introduce Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ) forextremely low-bit quantization of LLMs. We use Second-Order Optimization toformulate the LLM VQ problem and guide our quantization algorithm design bysolving the optimization. We further refine the weights usingChannel-Independent Second-Order Optimization for a granular VQ. In addition,by decomposing the optimization problem, we propose a brief and effectivecodebook initialization algorithm. We also extend VPTQ to support residual andoutlier quantization, which enhances model accuracy and further compresses themodel. Our experimental results show that VPTQ reduces model quantizationperplexity by $0.01$-$0.34$ on LLaMA-2, $0.38$-$0.68$ on Mistral-7B,$4.41$-$7.34$ on LLaMA-3 over SOTA at 2-bit, with an average accuracyimprovement of $0.79$-$1.5\%$ on LLaMA-2, $1\%$ on Mistral-7B, $11$-$22\%$ onLLaMA-3 on QA tasks on average.

However, these methods still face two challenges: the requirement fordozens of sampling steps to achieve satisfactory results, which limitsefficiency in real scenarios, and the neglect of degradation models, which arecritical auxiliary information in solving the SR problem. In this work, weintroduced a novel one-step SR model, which significantly addresses theefficiency issue of diffusion-based SR methods. Unlike existing fine-tuningstrategies, we designed a degradation-guided Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modulespecifically for SR, which corrects the model parameters based on thepre-estimated degradation information from low-resolution images. This modulenot only facilitates a powerful data-dependent or degradation-dependent SRmodel but also preserves the generative prior of the pre-trained diffusionmodel as much as possible. Furthermore, we tailor a novel training pipeline byintroducing an online negative sample generation strategy. Combined with theclassifier-free guidance strategy during inference, it largely improves theperceptual quality of the super-resolution results.

The use of diverse modalities, including histopathology slides,MRI, and genetic data, offers unprecedented opportunities to improve prognosisprediction and to unveil new treatment pathways. Contrastive learning, widelyused for deriving representations from paired data in multimodal tasks, assumesthat different views contain the same task-relevant information and leveragesonly shared information. This assumption becomes restrictive when handlingmedical data since each modality also harbors specific knowledge relevant todownstream tasks. We introduce DRIM, a new multimodal method for capturingthese shared and unique representations, despite data sparsity. Morespecifically, given a set of modalities, we aim to encode a representation foreach one that can be divided into two components: one encapsulatingpatient-related information common across modalities and the other,encapsulating modality-specific details. This is achieved by increasing theshared information among different patient modalities while minimizing theoverlap between shared and unique components within each modality. Our methodoutperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on glioma patients survival predictiontasks, while being robust to missing modalities.

Doctors need to conductthorough consultations, which include diagnosing the patient's condition,providing treatment advice, and transcribing detailed notes into medicalrecords. In regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds, doctors often have toask clarifying questions, further prolonging the process. While diagnosing isessential, transcription and summarization can often be automated using AI toimprove time efficiency and help doctors enhance care quality and enable earlydiagnosis and intervention. This paper proposes a solution using a localizedlarge language model (LLM) to transcribe, translate, and summarizedoctor-patient conversations. We utilize the Whisper model for transcriptionand GPT-3 to summarize them into the ePuskemas medical records format. Thissystem is implemented as an add-on to an existing web browser extension,allowing doctors to fill out patient forms while talking. By leveraging thissolution for real-time transcription, translation, and summarization, doctorscan improve the turnaround time for patient care while enhancing the quality ofrecords, which become more detailed and insightful for future visits. Thisinnovation addresses challenges like overcrowded facilities and theadministrative burden on healthcare providers in Indonesia. We believe thissolution will help doctors save time, provide better care, and produce moreaccurate medical records, representing a significant step toward modernizinghealthcare and ensuring patients receive timely, high-quality care, even inresource-constrained settings.</description><author>Azmul Asmar Irfan, Nur Ahmad Khatim, Mansur M.

While thesemodels have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict onevalue at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiplemeasures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporalfusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, andpropose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vitaltrajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signsrecorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperatureand respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures,which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accuratepredictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate ourmodel on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, anddemonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariateprediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vectorregression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform astudy case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changesin response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</description><author>Rosemary Y.

To address this, we propose a multi-source geographic data transformationsolution, utilizing accessible and complete VGI data to assist in generatingurban building footprint data. We also employ a multimodal data generationframework to improve accuracy. First, we introduce a pipeline for constructingan 'image-text-metadata-building footprint' dataset, primarily based on roadnetwork data and supplemented by other multimodal data. We then presentControlCity, a geographic data transformation method based on a multimodaldiffusion model. This method first uses a pre-trained text-to-image model toalign text, metadata, and building footprint data. An improved ControlNetfurther integrates road network and land-use imagery, producing refinedbuilding footprint data. Experiments across 22 global cities demonstrate thatControlCity successfully simulates real urban building patterns, achievingstate-of-the-art performance. Specifically, our method achieves an average FIDscore of 50.94, reducing error by 71.01% compared to leading methods, and aMIoU score of 0.36, an improvement of 38.46%.

GeoBiked is curated to contain 4 355 bicycleimages, annotated with structural and technical features and is used toinvestigate two automated labeling techniques: The utilization of consolidatedlatent features (Hyperfeatures) from image-generation models to detectgeometric correspondences (e.g. the position of the wheel center) in structuralimages and the generation of diverse text descriptions for structural images.GPT-4o, a vision-language-model (VLM), is instructed to analyze images andproduce diverse descriptions aligned with the system-prompt. By representingtechnical images as Diffusion-Hyperfeatures, drawing geometric correspondencesbetween them is possible. The detection accuracy of geometric points in unseensamples is improved by presenting multiple annotated source images. GPT-4o hassufficient capabilities to generate accurate descriptions of technical images.Grounding the generation only on images leads to diverse descriptions butcauses hallucinations, while grounding it on categorical labels restricts thediversity. Using both as input balances creativity and accuracy. Successfullyusing Hyperfeatures for geometric correspondence suggests that this approachcan be used for general point-detection and annotation tasks in technicalimages. Labeling such images with text descriptions using VLMs is possible, butdependent on the models detection capabilities, careful prompt-engineering andthe selection of input information. Applying foundation models in engineeringdesign is largely unexplored.

Quantization is apromising way to compress and accelerate models. Nevertheless, due to the widerange and time-varying activations in diffusion models, existing methods cannotmaintain both accuracy and efficiency simultaneously for low-bit quantization.To tackle this issue, we propose DilateQuant, a novel quantization frameworkfor diffusion models that offers comparable accuracy and high efficiency.Specifically, we keenly aware of numerous unsaturated in-channel weights, whichcan be cleverly exploited to reduce the range of activations without additionalcomputation cost. Based on this insight, we propose Weight Dilation (WD) thatmaximally dilates the unsaturated in-channel weights to a constrained rangethrough a mathematically equivalent scaling. WD costlessly absorbs theactivation quantization errors into weight quantization. The range ofactivations decreases, which makes activations quantization easy. The range ofweights remains constant, which makes model easy to converge in training stage.Considering the temporal network leads to time-varying activations, we design aTemporal Parallel Quantizer (TPQ), which sets time-step quantization parametersand supports parallel quantization for different time steps, significantlyimproving the performance and reducing time cost. To further enhanceperformance while preserving efficiency, we introduce a Block-wise KnowledgeDistillation (BKD) to align the quantized models with the full-precision modelsat a block level. The simultaneous training of time-step quantizationparameters and weights minimizes the time required, and the shorterbackpropagation paths decreases the memory footprint of the quantizationprocess.</description><author>Xuewen Liu, Zhikai Li, Qingyi Gu</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 15:56:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14307v2</guid></item><item><title>How to Connect Speech Foundation Models and Large Language Models?

Nevertheless, most current methods aredesigned solely to learn from the data distribution regardless of theunderlying Boltzmann distribution, and the physics priors such as energies andforces are constantly overlooked.

We propose using readily available front-facing video toinfer attention levels based on movements of the eyes, head, and face. We traina deep learning model to predict a measure of attention based on overt eyemovements. Specifically, we measure Inter-Subject Correlation of eye movementsin ten-second intervals while students watch the same educational videos. In 3different experiments (N=83) we show that the trained model predicts thisobjective metric of attention on unseen data with $R^2$=0.38, and on unseensubjects with $R^2$=0.26-0.30. The deep network relies mostly on a student'seye movements, but to some extent also on movements of the brows, cheeks, andhead. In contrast to Inter-Subject Correlation of the eyes, the model canestimate attentional engagement from individual students' movements withoutneeding reference data from an attentive group.

On the basis of these features,previous works have attempted to reconstruct high dynamic range (HDR) videosfrom events, but have either suffered from unrealistic artifacts or failed toprovide sufficiently high frame rates. In this paper, we present a recurrentconvolutional neural network that reconstruct high-speed HDR videos from eventsequences, with a key frame guidance to prevent potential error accumulationcaused by the sparse event data.

Although this story, generated by a large language model,is captivating, one may wonder -- how would the story have unfolded if themodel had chosen "Captain Maeve" as the protagonist instead? We cannot know.State-of-the-art large language models are stateless -- they maintain nointernal memory or state. Given a prompt, they generate a sequence of tokens asan output using an autoregressive process. As a consequence, they cannot reasonabout counterfactual alternatives to tokens they have generated in the past. Inthis work, our goal is to enhance them with this functionality. To this end, wedevelop a causal model of token generation that builds upon the Gumbel-Maxstructural causal model.

Simulated surgery allows for a realistic yet repeatable environment,meaning the insights gained from automated assessment can be used by novicesurgeons to hone their skills on the simulator before moving to real surgery.PRINTNet (Pituitary Real-time INstrument Tracking Network) has been created asa baseline model for this automated assessment. Consisting of DeepLabV3 forclassification and segmentation; StrongSORT for tracking; and the NVIDIAHoloscan SDK for real-time performance, PRINTNet achieved 71.9% Multiple ObjectTracking Precision running at 22 Frames Per Second. Using this tracking output,a Multilayer Perceptron achieved 87% accuracy in predicting surgical skilllevel (novice or expert), with the "ratio of total procedure time to instrumentvisible time" correlated with higher surgical skill.

However, we find that a well-designed combination of existingactivation functions within a neural network can also achieve this objective.In this paper, we introduce the Combined Units activation (CombU), whichemploys different activation functions at various dimensions across differentlayers. This approach can be theoretically proven to fit most mathematicalexpressions accurately. The experiments conducted on four mathematicalexpression datasets, compared against six State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) activationfunction algorithms, demonstrate that CombU outperforms all SOTA algorithms in10 out of 16 metrics and ranks in the top three for the remaining six metrics.</description><author>Jiayu Li, Zilong Zhao, Kevin Yee, Uzair Javaid, Biplab Sikdar</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 15:26:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17021v1</guid></item><item><title>PTQ4RIS: Post-Training Quantization for Referring Image Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17020v1</link><description>Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), aims to segment the object referred by agiven sentence in an image by understanding both visual and linguisticinformation.

This method optimizes computational resources by dynamicallyselecting key channels in feature maps for focused processing within theconvolutional blocks (Conv-Blocks), while skipping less relevant channels.Unlike conditional computation methods that require dynamic computation graphs,CNN MoD uses a static computation graph with fixed tensor sizes which improvehardware efficiency. It speeds up the training and inference processes withoutthe need for customized CUDA kernels, unique loss functions, or finetuning. CNNMoD either matches the performance of traditional CNNs with reduced inferencetimes, GMACs, and parameters, or exceeds their performance while maintainingsimilar inference times, GMACs, and parameters.

Active Debris Removal(ADR) has emerged as a promising approach to address this issue, utilisingOrbital Transfer Vehicles (OTVs) to facilitate debris deorbiting, therebyreducing future collision risks. However, ADR missions are substantiallycomplex, necessitating accurate planning to make the missions economicallyviable and technically effective. Moreover, these servicing missions require ahigh level of autonomous capability to plan under evolving orbital conditionsand changing mission requirements. In this paper, an autonomousdecision-planning model based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is developedto train an OTV to plan optimal debris removal sequencing.

Typically,existing methods mainly adopt domain adaptation to transfer motion knowledgefrom clean to degraded domain through one-stage adaptation. However, thisdirect adaptation is ineffective, since there exists a large gap due to adverseweather and scene style between clean and real degraded domains. Moreover, evenwithin the degraded domain itself, static weather (e.g., fog) and dynamicweather (e.g., rain) have different impacts on optical flow. To address aboveissues, we explore synthetic degraded domain as an intermediate bridge betweenclean and real degraded domains, and propose a cumulativehomogeneous-heterogeneous adaptation framework for real adverse weather opticalflow. Specifically, for clean-degraded transfer, our key insight is that staticweather possesses the depth-association homogeneous feature which does notchange the intrinsic motion of the scene, while dynamic weather additionallyintroduces the heterogeneous feature which results in a significant boundarydiscrepancy in warp errors between clean and degraded domains. Forsynthetic-real transfer, we figure out that cost volume correlation shares asimilar statistical histogram between synthetic and real degraded domains,benefiting to holistically aligning the homogeneous correlation distributionfor synthetic-real knowledge distillation. Under this unified framework, theproposed method can progressively and explicitly transfer knowledge from cleanscenes to real adverse weather. In addition, we further collect a real adverseweather dataset with manually annotated optical flow labels and performextensive experiments to verify the superiority of the proposed method.</description><author>Hanyu Zhou, Yi Chang, Zhiwei Shi, Wending Yan, Gang Chen, Yonghong Tian, Luxin Yan</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 15:05:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17001v1</guid></item><item><title>WasteGAN: Data Augmentation for Robotic Waste Sorting through Generative Adversarial Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16999v1</link><description>Robotic waste sorting poses significant challenges in both perception andmanipulation, given the extreme variability of objects that should berecognized on a cluttered conveyor belt. While deep learning has proveneffective in solving complex tasks, the necessity for extensive data collectionand labeling limits its applicability in real-world scenarios like wastesorting. To tackle this issue, we introduce a data augmentation method based ona novel GAN architecture called wasteGAN. The proposed method allows toincrease the performance of semantic segmentation models, starting from a verylimited bunch of labeled examples, such as few as 100. The key innovations ofwasteGAN include a novel loss function, a novel activation function, and alarger generator block. Overall, such innovations helps the network to learnfrom limited number of examples and synthesize data that better mirrorsreal-world distributions. We then leverage the higher-quality segmentationmasks predicted from models trained on the wasteGAN synthetic data to computesemantic-aware grasp poses, enabling a robotic arm to effectively recognizingcontaminants and separating waste in a real-world scenario. Throughcomprehensive evaluation encompassing dataset-based assessments and real-worldexperiments, our methodology demonstrated promising potential for robotic wastesorting, yielding performance gains of up to 5.8\% in picking contaminants.

Therefore RSD plays an important role in improving patient care andminimising surgical theatre costs via efficient scheduling. In endoscopicpituitary surgery, it is uniquely challenging due to variable workflowsequences with a selection of optional steps contributing to high variabilityin surgery duration. This paper presents PitRSDNet for predicting RSD duringpituitary surgery, a spatio-temporal neural network model that learns fromhistorical data focusing on workflow sequences. PitRSDNet integrates workflowknowledge into RSD prediction in two forms: 1) multi-task learning forconcurrently predicting step and RSD; and 2) incorporating prior steps ascontext in temporal learning and inference. PitRSDNet is trained and evaluatedon a new endoscopic pituitary surgery dataset with 88 videos to showcompetitive performance improvements over previous statistical and machinelearning methods. The findings also highlight how PitRSDNet improve RSDprecision on outlier cases utilising the knowledge of prior steps.</description><author>Anjana Wijekoon, Adrito Das, Roxana R. Herrera, Danyal Z.

Recent research demonstrates that LLMsare highly vulnerable to jailbreaking and prompt injection attacks, whichdisrupt the safety and quality goals of LLMs using adversarial strings. Thiswork investigates the impact of prompt injections on the ranking order ofsources referenced by conversational search engines. To this end, we introducea focused dataset of real-world consumer product websites and formalizeconversational search ranking as an adversarial problem. Experimentally, weanalyze conversational search rankings in the absence of adversarial injectionsand show that different LLMs vary significantly in prioritizing product name,document content, and context position. We then present a tree-of-attacks-basedjailbreaking technique which reliably promotes low-ranked products.Importantly, these attacks transfer effectively to state-of-the-artconversational search engines such as perplexity$.$ai.

To achieve this, researchers are currently investigating theuse of data influence to measure the importance of data instances, $i.e.,$ ahigh influence score indicates that incorporating this instance to the trainingset is likely to enhance the model performance. Consequently, they select thetop-$k$ instances with the highest scores. However, this approach has severallimitations. (1) Computing the influence of all available data istime-consuming. (2) The selected data instances are not diverse enough, whichmay hinder the pre-trained model's ability to generalize effectively to variousdownstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{Quad}, a data selectionapproach that considers both quality and diversity by using data influence toachieve state-of-the-art pre-training results. In particular, noting thatattention layers capture extensive semantic details, we have adapted theaccelerated $iHVP$ computation methods for attention layers, enhancing ourability to evaluate the influence of data, $i.e.,$ its quality. For thediversity, \texttt{Quad} clusters the dataset into similar data instanceswithin each cluster and diverse instances across different clusters. For eachcluster, if we opt to select data from it, we take some samples to evaluate theinfluence to prevent processing all instances. To determine which clusters toselect, we utilize the classic Multi-Armed Bandit method, treating each clusteras an arm. This approach favors clusters with highly influential instances(ensuring high quality) or clusters that have been selected less frequently(ensuring diversity), thereby well balancing between quality and diversity.</description><author>Chi Zhang, Huaping Zhong, Kuan Zhang, Chengliang Chai, Rui Wang, Xinlin Zhuang, Tianyi Bai, Jiantao Qiu, Lei Cao, Ye Yuan, Guoren Wang, Conghui He</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 14:49:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16986v1</guid></item><item><title>AXCEL: Automated eXplainable Consistency Evaluation using LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16984v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in both industry and academiafor various tasks, yet evaluating the consistency of generated text responsescontinues to be a challenge. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BLEU show aweak correlation with human judgment. More sophisticated metrics using NaturalLanguage Inference (NLI) have shown improved correlations but are complex toimplement, require domain-specific training due to poor cross-domaingeneralization, and lack explainability. More recently, prompt-based metricsusing LLMs as evaluators have emerged; while they are easier to implement, theystill lack explainability and depend on task-specific prompts, which limitstheir generalizability. This work introduces Automated eXplainable ConsistencyEvaluation using LLMs (AXCEL), a prompt-based consistency metric which offersexplanations for the consistency scores by providing detailed reasoning andpinpointing inconsistent text spans. AXCEL is also a generalizable metric whichcan be adopted to multiple tasks without changing the prompt. AXCEL outperformsboth non-prompt and prompt-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics in detectinginconsistencies across summarization by 8.7%, free text generation by 6.2%, anddata-to-text conversion tasks by 29.4%. We also evaluate the influence ofunderlying LLMs on prompt based metric performance and recalibrate the SOTAprompt-based metrics with the latest LLMs for fair comparison. Further, we showthat AXCEL demonstrates strong performance using open source LLMs.</description><author>P Aditya Sreekar, Sahil Verma, Suransh Chopra, Sarik Ghazarian, Abhishek Persad, Narayanan Sadagopan</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 14:45:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16984v1</guid></item><item><title>Guide-and-Rescale: Self-Guidance Mechanism for Effective Tuning-Free Real Image Editing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01322v3</link><description>Despite recent advances in large-scale text-to-image generative models,manipulating real images with these models remains a challenging problem. Themain limitations of existing editing methods are that they either fail toperform with consistent quality on a wide range of image edits or requiretime-consuming hyperparameter tuning or fine-tuning of the diffusion model topreserve the image-specific appearance of the input image. We propose a novelapproach that is built upon a modified diffusion sampling process via theguidance mechanism. In this work, we explore the self-guidance technique topreserve the overall structure of the input image and its local regionsappearance that should not be edited. In particular, we explicitly introducelayout-preserving energy functions that are aimed to save local and globalstructures of the source image. Additionally, we propose a noise rescalingmechanism that allows to preserve noise distribution by balancing the norms ofclassifier-free guidance and our proposed guiders during generation. Such aguiding approach does not require fine-tuning the diffusion model and exactinversion process. As a result, the proposed method provides a fast andhigh-quality editing mechanism. In our experiments, we show through humanevaluation and quantitative analysis that the proposed method allows to producedesired editing which is more preferable by humans and also achieves a bettertrade-off between editing quality and preservation of the original image.
