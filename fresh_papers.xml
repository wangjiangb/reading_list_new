However, dueto the challenges in data collection and network designs, it remainschallenging for existing solutions to achieve real-time full-body capture whilebeing accurate in world space. In this work, we contribute a sequentialproxy-to-motion learning scheme together with a proxy dataset of 2D skeletonsequences and 3D rotational motions in world space. Such proxy data enables usto build a learning-based network with accurate full-body supervision whilealso mitigating the generalization issues. For more accurate and physicallyplausible predictions, a contact-aware neural motion descent module is proposedin our network so that it can be aware of foot-ground contact and motionmisalignment with the proxy observations. Additionally, we share the body-handcontext information in our network for more compatible wrist poses recoverywith the full-body model. With the proposed learning-based solution, wedemonstrate the first real-time monocular full-body capture system withplausible foot-ground contact in world space.

They are more expressive than analytic models andoccupy less memory than tabulated BTFs. However, existing neural materials areimmutable, meaning that their output for a certain query of UVs, camera, andlight vector is fixed once they are trained. While this is practical when thereis no need to edit the material, it can become very limiting when the fragmentof the material used for training is too small or not tileable, whichfrequently happens when the material has been captured with agonioreflectometer. In this paper, we propose a novel neural materialrepresentation which jointly tackles the problems of BTF compression, tiling,and extrapolation. At test time, our method uses a guidance image as input tocondition the neural BTF to the structural features of this input image. Then,the neural BTF can be queried as a regular BTF using UVs, camera, and lightvectors. Every component in our framework is purposefully designed to maximizeBTF encoding quality at minimal parameter count and computational complexity,achieving competitive compression rates compared with previous work. Wedemonstrate the results of our method on a variety of synthetic and capturedmaterials, showing its generality and capacity to learn to represent manyoptical properties.</description><author>Carlos Rodriguez-Pardo, Konstantinos Kazatzis, Jorge Lopez-Moreno, Elena Garces</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 18:59:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01199v1</guid></item><item><title>Improved sampling via learned diffusions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01198v1</link><description>Recently, a series of papers proposed deep learning-based approaches tosample from unnormalized target densities using controlled diffusion processes.In this work, we identify these approaches as special cases of theSchr\"odinger bridge problem, seeking the most likely stochastic evolutionbetween a given prior distribution and the specified target. We furthergeneralize this framework by introducing a variational formulation based ondivergences between path space measures of time-reversed diffusion processes.This abstract perspective leads to practical losses that can be optimized bygradient-based algorithms and includes previous objectives as special cases. Atthe same time, it allows us to consider divergences other than the reverseKullback-Leibler divergence that is known to suffer from mode collapse. Inparticular, we propose the so-called log-variance loss, which exhibitsfavorable numerical properties and leads to significantly improved performanceacross all considered approaches.</description><author>Lorenz Richter, Julius Berner, Guan-Horng Liu</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 18:58:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01198v1</guid></item><item><title>Segment Anything Meets Point Tracking</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01197v1</link><description>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has established itself as a powerfulzero-shot image segmentation model, employing interactive prompts such aspoints to generate masks. This paper presents SAM-PT, a method extending SAM'scapability to tracking and segmenting anything in dynamic videos. SAM-PTleverages robust and sparse point selection and propagation techniques for maskgeneration, demonstrating that a SAM-based segmentation tracker can yieldstrong zero-shot performance across popular video object segmentationbenchmarks, including DAVIS, YouTube-VOS, and MOSE. Compared to traditionalobject-centric mask propagation strategies, we uniquely use point propagationto exploit local structure information that is agnostic to object semantics. Wehighlight the merits of point-based tracking through direct evaluation on thezero-shot open-world Unidentified Video Objects (UVO) benchmark. To furtherenhance our approach, we utilize K-Medoids clustering for point initializationand track both positive and negative points to clearly distinguish the targetobject. We also employ multiple mask decoding passes for mask refinement anddevise a point re-initialization strategy to improve tracking accuracy. Ourcode integrates different point trackers and video segmentation benchmarks andwill be released at https://github.com/SysCV/sam-pt.</description><author>Frano Rajič, Lei Ke, Yu-Wing Tai, Chi-Keung Tang, Martin Danelljan, Fisher Yu</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 18:58:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01197v1</guid></item><item><title>Online Heavy-tailed Change-point detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09548v2</link><description>We study algorithms for online change-point detection (OCPD), where samplesthat are potentially heavy-tailed, are presented one at a time and a change inthe underlying mean must be detected as early as possible. We present analgorithm based on clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), that works evenif we only assume that the second moment of the data generating process isbounded. We derive guarantees on worst-case, finite-sample false-positive rate(FPR) over the family of all distributions with bounded second moment. Thus,our method is the first OCPD algorithm that guarantees finite-sample FPR, evenif the data is high dimensional and the underlying distributions areheavy-tailed. The technical contribution of our paper is to show thatclipped-SGD can estimate the mean of a random vector and simultaneously provideconfidence bounds at all confidence values. We combine this robust estimatewith a union bound argument and construct a sequential change-point algorithmwith finite-sample FPR guarantees. We show empirically that our algorithm workswell in a variety of situations, whether the underlying data are heavy-tailed,light-tailed, high dimensional or discrete. No other algorithm achieves boundedFPR theoretically or empirically, over all settings we study simultaneously.</description><author>Abishek Sankararaman, Balakrishnan, Narayanaswamy</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 18:56:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09548v2</guid></item><item><title>Squeezing Large-Scale Diffusion Models for Mobile</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01193v1</link><description>The emergence of diffusion models has greatly broadened the scope ofhigh-fidelity image synthesis, resulting in notable advancements in bothpractical implementation and academic research. With the active adoption of themodel in various real-world applications, the need for on-device deployment hasgrown considerably. However, deploying large diffusion models such as StableDiffusion with more than one billion parameters to mobile devices posesdistinctive challenges due to the limited computational and memory resources,which may vary according to the device. In this paper, we present thechallenges and solutions for deploying Stable Diffusion on mobile devices withTensorFlow Lite framework, which supports both iOS and Android devices.

However, suchconstructions require large memory overhead, which makes simulation of moresophisticated internal models intractable. In this work, we propose anefficient construction, Transformer in Transformer (in short, TinT), thatallows a transformer to simulate and fine-tune complex models internally duringinference (e.g., pre-trained language models). In particular, we introduceinnovative approximation techniques that allow a TinT model with less than 2billion parameters to simulate and fine-tune a 125 million parametertransformer model within a single forward pass. TinT accommodates many commontransformer variants and its design ideas also improve the efficiency of pastinstantiations of simple models inside transformers. We conduct end-to-endexperiments to validate the internal fine-tuning procedure of TinT on variouslanguage modeling and downstream tasks. For example, even with a limitedone-step budget, we observe TinT for a OPT-125M model improves performance by4-16% absolute on average compared to OPT-125M. These findings suggest thatlarge pre-trained language models are capable of performing intricatesubroutines. To facilitate further work, a modular and extensible codebase forTinT is included.</description><author>Abhishek Panigrahi, Sadhika Malladi, Mengzhou Xia, Sanjeev Arora</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 18:53:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01189v1</guid></item><item><title>SAMAug: Point Prompt Augmentation for Segment Anything Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01187v1</link><description>This paper introduces SAMAug, a novel visual point augmentation method forthe Segment Anything Model (SAM) that enhances interactive image segmentationperformance. SAMAug generates augmented point prompts to provide moreinformation to SAM. From the initial point prompt, SAM produces the initialmask, which is then fed into our proposed SAMAug to generate augmented pointprompts. By incorporating these extra points, SAM can generate augmentedsegmentation masks based on the augmented point prompts and the initial prompt,resulting in improved segmentation performance. We evaluate four pointaugmentation techniques: random selection, maximum difference entropy, maximumdistance, and a saliency model. Experiments on the COCO, Fundus, and ChestX-ray datasets demonstrate that SAMAug can boost SAM's segmentation results,especially using the maximum distance and saliency model methods. SAMAugunderscores the potential of visual prompt engineering to advance interactivecomputer vision models.</description><author>Haixing Dai, Chong Ma, Zhengliang Liu, Yiwei Li, Peng Shu, Xiaozheng Wei, Lin Zhao, Zihao Wu, Dajiang Zhu, Wei Liu, Quanzheng Li, Tianming Liu, Xiang Li</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 18:52:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01187v1</guid></item><item><title>Fitting an ellipsoid to a quadratic number of random points</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01181v1</link><description>We consider the problem $(\mathrm{P})$ of fitting $n$ standard Gaussianrandom vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to the boundary of a centered ellipsoid, as$n, d \to \infty$. This problem is conjectured to have a sharp feasibilitytransition: for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, if $n \leq (1 - \varepsilon) d^2 / 4$then $(\mathrm{P})$ has a solution with high probability, while $(\mathrm{P})$has no solutions with high probability if $n \geq (1 + \varepsilon) d^2 /4$. Sofar, only a trivial bound $n \geq d^2 / 2$ is known on the negative side, whilethe best results on the positive side assume $n \leq d^2 /\mathrm{polylog}(d)$. In this work, we improve over previous approaches using akey result of Bartl &amp; Mendelson on the concentration of Gram matrices of randomvectors under mild assumptions on their tail behavior. This allows us to give asimple proof that $(\mathrm{P})$ is feasible with high probability when $n \leqd^2 / C$, for a (possibly large) constant $C &gt; 0$.</description><author>Afonso S.

On the other hand, it is well-known thatgraph invariants learned by these class of models are incomplete: there arepairs of non-isomorphic graphs which cannot be distinguished by standard graphneural networks. This is unsurprising given the computational difficulty ofgraph isomorphism testing on general graphs, but the situation begs to differfor special graph classes, for which efficient graph isomorphism testingalgorithms are known, such as planar graphs. The goal of this work is to designarchitectures for efficiently learning complete invariants of planar graphs.Inspired by the classical planar graph isomorphism algorithm of Hopcroft andTarjan, we propose PlanE as a framework for planar representation learning.PlanE includes architectures which can learn complete invariants over planargraphs while remaining practically scalable. We empirically validate the strongperformance of the resulting model architectures on well-known planar graphbenchmarks, achieving multiple state-of-the-art results.</description><author>Radoslav Dimitrov, Zeyang Zhao, Ralph Abboud, İsmail İlkan Ceylan</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 18:45:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01180v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning Mixtures of Gaussians Using the DDPM Objective</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01178v1</link><description>Recent works have shown that diffusion models can learn essentially anydistribution provided one can perform score estimation. Yet it remains poorlyunderstood under what settings score estimation is possible, let alone whenpractical gradient-based algorithms for this task can provably succeed. In this work, we give the first provably efficient results along these linesfor one of the most fundamental distribution families, Gaussian mixture models.We prove that gradient descent on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model(DDPM) objective can efficiently recover the ground truth parameters of themixture model in the following two settings: 1) We show gradient descent withrandom initialization learns mixtures of two spherical Gaussians in $d$dimensions with $1/\text{poly}(d)$-separated centers. 2) We show gradientdescent with a warm start learns mixtures of $K$ spherical Gaussians with$\Omega(\sqrt{\log(\min(K,d))})$-separated centers. A key ingredient in ourproofs is a new connection between score-based methods and two other approachesto distribution learning, the EM algorithm and spectral methods.</description><author>Kulin Shah, Sitan Chen, Adam Klivans</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 18:44:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01178v1</guid></item><item><title>ELQA: A Corpus of Metalinguistic Questions and Answers about English</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00395v2</link><description>We present ELQA, a corpus of questions and answers in and about the Englishlanguage.

In this work, we view amulti-layer NN with arbitrary width as defining a particular hierarchy ofreproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), named a Neural Hilbert Ladder (NHL).This allows us to define a function space and a complexity measure thatgeneralize prior results for shallow NNs, and we then examine their theoreticalproperties and implications in several aspects. First, we prove acorrespondence between functions expressed by L-layer NNs and those belongingto L-level NHLs. Second, we prove generalization guarantees for learning an NHLwith the complexity measure controlled. Third, corresponding to the training ofmulti-layer NNs in the infinite-width mean-field limit, we derive an evolutionof the NHL characterized as the dynamics of multiple random fields. Fourth, weshow examples of depth separation in NHLs under ReLU and quadratic activationfunctions.

In practice, when the quantum state is unknown and onlycopies thereof are available, one must resort to the estimation of such entropymeasures. Here we propose a variational quantum algorithm for estimating thevon Neumann and R\'enyi entropies, as well as the measured relative entropy andmeasured R\'enyi relative entropy. Our approach first parameterizes avariational formula for the measure of interest by a quantum circuit and aclassical neural network, and then optimizes the resulting objective overparameter space. Numerical simulations of our quantum algorithm are provided,using a noiseless quantum simulator. The algorithm provides accurate estimatesof the various entropy measures for the examples tested, which renders it as apromising approach for usage in downstream tasks.</description><author>Ziv Goldfeld, Dhrumil Patel, Sreejith Sreekumar, Mark M.

By exploiting a connection between the greedy 2-coordinateupdate for this problem and equality-constrained steepest descent in the1-norm, we give a convergence rate for greedy selection under a proximalPolyak-Lojasiewicz assumption that is faster than random selection andindependent of the problem dimension $n$. We then consider minimizing with botha summation constraint and bound constraints, as arises in the support vectormachine dual problem. Existing greedy rules for this setting either guaranteetrivial progress only or require $O(n^2)$ time to compute. We show that bound-and summation-constrained steepest descent in the L1-norm guarantees moreprogress per iteration than previous rules and can be computed in only $O(n\log n)$ time.</description><author>Amrutha Varshini Ramesh, Aaron Mishkin, Mark Schmidt, Yihan Zhou, Jonathan Wilder Lavington, Jennifer She</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 18:27:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01169v1</guid></item><item><title>Don't freeze: Finetune encoders for better Self-Supervised HAR</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01168v1</link><description>Recently self-supervised learning has been proposed in the field of humanactivity recognition as a solution to the labelled data availability problem.The idea being that by using pretext tasks such as reconstruction orcontrastive predictive coding, useful representations can be learned that thencan be used for classification. Those approaches follow the pretrain, freezeand fine-tune procedure. In this paper we will show how a simple change - notfreezing the representation - leads to substantial performance gains acrosspretext tasks. The improvement was found in all four investigated datasets andacross all four pretext tasks and is inversely proportional to amount oflabelled data. Moreover the effect is present whether the pretext task iscarried on the Capture24 dataset or directly in unlabelled data of the targetdataset.</description><author>Vitor Fortes Rey, Dominique Nshimyimana, Paul Lukowicz</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 18:23:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01168v1</guid></item><item><title>Coupled Gradient Flows for Strategic Non-Local Distribution Shift</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01166v1</link><description>We propose a novel framework for analyzing the dynamics of distribution shiftin real-world systems that captures the feedback loop between learningalgorithms and the distributions on which they are deployed. Prior work largelymodels feedback-induced distribution shift as adversarial or via an overlysimplistic distribution-shift structure. In contrast, we propose a coupledpartial differential equation model that captures fine-grained changes in thedistribution over time by accounting for complex dynamics that arise due tostrategic responses to algorithmic decision-making, non-local endogenouspopulation interactions, and other exogenous sources of distribution shift. Weconsider two common settings in machine learning: cooperative settings withinformation asymmetries, and competitive settings where a learner facesstrategic users. For both of these settings, when the algorithm retrains viagradient descent, we prove asymptotic convergence of the retraining procedureto a steady-state, both in finite and in infinite dimensions, obtainingexplicit rates in terms of the model parameters. To do so we derive new resultson the convergence of coupled PDEs that extends what is known on multi-speciessystems. Empirically, we show that our approach captures well-documented formsof distribution shifts like polarization and disparate impacts that simplermodels cannot capture.</description><author>Lauren Conger, Franca Hoffmann, Eric Mazumdar, Lillian Ratliff</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 18:18:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01166v1</guid></item><item><title>Improving Language Plasticity via Pretraining with Active Forgetting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01163v1</link><description>Pretrained language models (PLMs) are today the primary model for naturallanguage processing. Despite their impressive downstream performance, it can bedifficult to apply PLMs to new languages, a barrier to making theircapabilities universally accessible. While prior work has shown it possible toaddress this issue by learning a new embedding layer for the new language,doing so is both data and compute inefficient. We propose to use an activeforgetting mechanism during pretraining, as a simple way of creating PLMs thatcan quickly adapt to new languages. Concretely, by resetting the embeddinglayer every K updates during pretraining, we encourage the PLM to improve itsability of learning new embeddings within a limited number of updates, similarto a meta-learning effect. Experiments with RoBERTa show that models pretrainedwith our forgetting mechanism not only demonstrate faster convergence duringlanguage adaptation but also outperform standard ones in a low-data regime,particularly for languages that are distant from English.</description><author>Yihong Chen, Kelly Marchisio, Roberta Raileanu, David Ifeoluwa Adelani, Pontus Stenetor, Sebastian Riedel, Mikel Artetx</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 18:12:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01163v1</guid></item><item><title>Soft Gripping: Specifying for Trustworthiness</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01159v1</link><description>Soft robotics is an emerging technology in which engineers create flexibledevices for use in a variety of applications. In order to advance the wideadoption of soft robots, ensuring their trustworthiness is essential; if softrobots are not trusted, they will not be used to their full potential. In orderto demonstrate trustworthiness, a specification needs to be formulated todefine what is trustworthy. However, even for soft robotic grippers, which isone of the most mature areas in soft robotics, the soft robotics community hasso far given very little attention to formulating specifications. In this work,we discuss the importance of developing specifications during development ofsoft robotic systems, and present an extensive example specification for a softgripper for pick-and-place tasks for grocery items. The proposed specificationcovers both functional and non-functional requirements, such as reliability,safety, adaptability, predictability, ethics, and regulations.

In thiswork, we make an important observation: there are many different inputs forwhich an algorithm will perform certain intermediate computations identically.This insight allows us to develop data augmentation procedures that, given analgorithm's intermediate trajectory, produce inputs for which the targetalgorithm would have exactly the same next trajectory step. We ensureinvariance in the next-step prediction across such inputs, by employing aself-supervised objective derived by our observation, formalised in a causalgraph. We prove that the resulting method, which we call Hint-ReLIC, improvesthe OOD generalisation capabilities of the reasoner.

Recently, a new audio-visual segmentation (AVS) task hasbeen introduced, aiming to locate and segment the sounding objects in a givenvideo. This task demands audio-driven pixel-level scene understanding for thefirst time, posing significant challenges. In this paper, we proposeAVSegFormer, a novel framework for AVS tasks that leverages the transformerarchitecture. Specifically, we introduce audio queries and learnable queriesinto the transformer decoder, enabling the network to selectively attend tointerested visual features. Besides, we present an audio-visual mixer, whichcan dynamically adjust visual features by amplifying relevant and suppressingirrelevant spatial channels. Additionally, we devise an intermediate mask lossto enhance the supervision of the decoder, encouraging the network to producemore accurate intermediate predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate thatAVSegFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on the AVS benchmark.

In this work, we derive novelstatistical bounds for empirical plug-in estimators of the EOT cost and showthat their statistical performance in the entropy regularization parameter$\epsilon$ and the sample size $n$ only depends on the simpler of the twoprobability measures. For instance, under sufficiently smooth costs this yieldsthe parametric rate $n^{-1/2}$ with factor $\epsilon^{-d/2}$, where $d$ is theminimum dimension of the two population measures. This confirms that empiricalEOT also adheres to the lower complexity adaptation principle, a hallmarkfeature only recently identified for unregularized OT. As a consequence of ourtheory, we show that the empirical entropic Gromov-Wasserstein distance and itsunregularized version for measures on Euclidean spaces also obey thisprinciple. Additionally, we comment on computational aspects and complement ourfindings with Monte Carlo simulations. Our techniques employ empirical processtheory and rely on a dual formulation of EOT over a single function class.Crucial to our analysis is the observation that the entropiccost-transformation of a function class does not increase its uniform metricentropy by much.</description><author>Michel Groppe, Shayan Hundrieser</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 17:37:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13580v2</guid></item><item><title>Statler: State-Maintaining Language Models for Embodied Reasoning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17840v2</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) provide a promising tool that enable robots toperform complex robot reasoning tasks. However, the limited context window ofcontemporary LLMs makes reasoning over long time horizons difficult. Embodiedtasks such as those that one might expect a household robot to performtypically require that the planner consider information acquired a long timeago (e.g., properties of the many objects that the robot previously encounteredin the environment). Attempts to capture the world state using an LLM'simplicit internal representation is complicated by the paucity of task- andenvironment-relevant information available in a robot's action history, whilemethods that rely on the ability to convey information via the prompt to theLLM are subject to its limited context window. In this paper, we proposeStatler, a framework that endows LLMs with an explicit representation of theworld state as a form of ``memory'' that is maintained over time. Integral toStatler is its use of two instances of general LLMs -- a world-model reader anda world-model writer -- that interface with and maintain the world state. Byproviding access to this world state ``memory'', Statler improves the abilityof existing LLMs to reason over longer time horizons without the constraint ofcontext length. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on threesimulated table-top manipulation domains and a real robot domain, and show thatit improves the state-of-the-art in LLM-based robot reasoning.

Key to the design ofSparseOptimizer is an embedded shrinkage operator, which imparts sparsitydirectly within the optimization process. This operator, backed by a soundtheoretical framework, includes an analytical solution, thereby reinforcing theoptimizer's robustness and efficacy. Crucially, SparseOptimizer's plug-and-playfunctionality eradicates the need for code modifications, making it auniversally adaptable tool for a wide array of large language models. Empiricalevaluations on benchmark datasets such as GLUE, RACE, SQuAD1, and SQuAD2confirm that SparseBERT and SparseALBERT, when sparsified usingSparseOptimizer, achieve performance comparable to their dense counterparts,BERT and ALBERT, while significantly reducing their parameter count. Further,this work proposes an innovative optimizer-compiler co-design strategy,demonstrating the potential of inference acceleration (\textbf{3.37x},\textbf{6.30x}, and \textbf{7.15x} in comparison with Pytorch, TensorFlow, andLLVM generic compile, respectively) in SparseBERT when paired with anappropriately designed compiler. This study represents a significant stepforward in the evolution of efficient, scalable, and high-performing largelanguage models, setting a precedent for future exploration and optimization inthis domain.

Although large languagemodels (LLMs) have made significant strides in many natural language processingtasks, their effectiveness in biomedical concept mapping is yet to be fullyexplored. This research investigates a method that exploits the in-contextlearning (ICL) capabilities of large models for biomedical concept linking. Theproposed approach adopts a two-stage retrieve-and-rank framework. Initially,biomedical concepts are embedded using language models, and then embeddingsimilarity is utilized to retrieve the top candidates. These candidates'contextual information is subsequently incorporated into the prompt andprocessed by a large language model to re-rank the concepts. This approachachieved an accuracy of 90.% in BC5CDR disease entity normalization and 94.7%in chemical entity normalization, exhibiting a competitive performance relativeto supervised learning methods. Further, it showed a significant improvement,with an over 20-point absolute increase in F1 score on an oncology matchingdataset.

Many techniques have been developed to enhance fairness includingcommonly-used group fairness measures and several fairness-aware methodscombining ensemble learning. However, existing fairness measures can only focuson one aspect -- either group or individual fairness, and the hardcompatibility among them indicates a possibility of remaining biases even ifone of them is satisfied. Moreover, existing mechanisms to boost fairnessusually present empirical results to show validity, yet few of them discusswhether fairness can be boosted with certain theoretical guarantees. To addressthese issues, we propose a fairness quality measure named discriminative riskin this paper to reflect both individual and group fairness aspects.Furthermore, we investigate the properties of the proposed measure and proposefirst- and second-order oracle bounds to show that fairness can be boosted viaensemble combination with theoretical learning guarantees. Note that theanalysis is suitable for both binary and multi-class classification. A pruningmethod is also proposed to utilise our proposed measure and comprehensiveexperiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodsin this paper.</description><author>Yijun Bian, Kun Zhang, Anqi Qiu</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 17:12:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10813v2</guid></item><item><title>Shikra: Unleashing Multimodal LLM's Referential Dialogue Magic</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15195v2</link><description>In human conversations, individuals can indicate relevant regions within ascene while addressing others.

This natural referential ability indialogue remains absent in current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Tofill this gap, this paper proposes an MLLM called Shikra, which can handlespatial coordinate inputs and outputs in natural language.

It is designed tobe straightforward and simple, without the need for extra vocabularies,position encoder, pre-/post-detection modules, or external plug-in models. Allinputs and outputs are in natural language form. Referential dialogue is asuperset of various vision-language (VL) tasks.

In this context, knowledgegraphs represent a potent tool for retrieving and organizing a vast amount ofinformation in a properly interconnected and interpretable structure. However,their generation is still challenging and often requires considerable humaneffort and domain expertise, hampering the scalability and flexibility acrossdifferent application fields. This paper proposes an innovative knowledge graphgeneration approach that leverages the potential of the latest generative largelanguage models, such as GPT-3.5, that can address all the main critical issuesin knowledge graph building. The approach is conveyed in a pipeline thatcomprises novel iterative zero-shot and external knowledge-agnostic strategiesin the main stages of the generation process. Our unique manifold approach mayencompass significant benefits to the scientific community. In particular, themain contribution can be summarized by: (i) an innovative strategy foriteratively prompting large language models to extract relevant components ofthe final graph; (ii) a zero-shot strategy for each prompt, meaning that thereis no need for providing examples for "guiding" the prompt result; (iii) ascalable solution, as the adoption of LLMs avoids the need for any externalresources or human expertise. To assess the effectiveness of our proposedmodel, we performed experiments on a dataset that covered a specific domain.

When a robot needs to interact with its environment, it mustbe able to comprehend the contextual information of its surroundings. This workfocuses on classifying and localising objects within a map, which is underconstruction (SLAM) or already built. To further explore this direction, wepropose a framework that can autonomously detect and localize predefinedobjects in a known environment using a multi-modal sensor fusion approach(combining RGB and depth data from an RGB-D camera and a lidar). The frameworkconsists of three key elements: understanding the environment through RGB data,estimating depth through multi-modal sensor fusion, and managing artifacts(i.e., filtering and stabilizing measurements). The experiments show that theproposed framework can accurately detect 98% of the objects in the real sampleenvironment, without post-processing, while 85% and 80% of the objects weremapped using the single RGBD camera or RGB + lidar setup respectively. Thecomparison with single-sensor (camera or lidar) experiments is performed toshow that sensor fusion allows the robot to accurately detect near and farobstacles, which would have been noisy or imprecise in a purely visual orlaser-based approach.</description><author>Federico Rollo, Gennaro Raiola, Andrea Zunino, Nikolaos Tsagarakis, Arash Ajoudani</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 16:51:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01121v1</guid></item><item><title>Embeddings as Epistemic States: Limitations on the Use of Pooling Operators for Accumulating Knowledge</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05723v2</link><description>Various neural network architectures rely on pooling operators to aggregateinformation coming from different sources. It is often implicitly assumed insuch contexts that vectors encode epistemic states, i.e. that vectors capturethe evidence that has been obtained about some properties of interest, and thatpooling these vectors yields a vector that combines this evidence. We study,for a number of standard pooling operators, under what conditions they arecompatible with this idea, which we call the epistemic pooling principle. Whilewe find that all the considered pooling operators can satisfy the epistemicpooling principle, this only holds when embeddings are sufficientlyhigh-dimensional and, for most pooling operators, when the embeddings satisfyparticular constraints (e.g. having non-negative coordinates). We furthermoreshow that these constraints have important implications on how the embeddingscan be used in practice. In particular, we find that when the epistemic poolingprinciple is satisfied, in most cases it is impossible to verify thesatisfaction of propositional formulas using linear scoring functions, with twoexceptions: (i) max-pooling with embeddings that are upper-bounded and (ii)Hadamard pooling with non-negative embeddings. This finding helps to clarify,among others, why Graph Neural Networks sometimes under-perform in reasoningtasks. Finally, we also study an extension of the epistemic pooling principleto weighted epistemic states, which are important in the context ofnon-monotonic reasoning, where max-pooling emerges as the most suitableoperator.</description><author>Steven Schockaert</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 16:46:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05723v2</guid></item><item><title>MeT: A Graph Transformer for Semantic Segmentation of 3D Meshes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01115v1</link><description>Polygonal meshes have become the standard for discretely approximating 3Dshapes, thanks to their efficiency and high flexibility in capturingnon-uniform shapes. This non-uniformity, however, leads to irregularity in themesh structure, making tasks like segmentation of 3D meshes particularlychallenging. Semantic segmentation of 3D mesh has been typically addressedthrough CNN-based approaches, leading to good accuracy. Recently, transformershave gained enough momentum both in NLP and computer vision fields, achievingperformance at least on par with CNN models, supporting the long-soughtarchitecture universalism. Following this trend, we propose a transformer-basedmethod for semantic segmentation of 3D mesh motivated by a better modeling ofthe graph structure of meshes, by means of global attention mechanisms. Inorder to address the limitations of standard transformer architectures inmodeling relative positions of non-sequential data, as in the case of 3Dmeshes, as well as in capturing the local context, we perform positionalencoding by means the Laplacian eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix, replacingthe traditional sinusoidal positional encodings, and by introducingclustering-based features into the self-attention and cross-attentionoperators. Experimental results, carried out on three sets of the Shape COSEGDataset, on the human segmentation dataset proposed in Maron et al., 2017 andon the ShapeNet benchmark, show how the proposed approach yieldsstate-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation of 3D meshes.</description><author>Giuseppe Vecchio, Luca Prezzavento, Carmelo Pino, Francesco Rundo, Simone Palazzo, Concetto Spampinato</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 16:45:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01115v1</guid></item><item><title>EVD Surgical Guidance with Retro-Reflective Tool Tracking and Spatial Reconstruction using Head-Mounted Augmented Reality Device</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15490v2</link><description>Augmented Reality (AR) has been used to facilitate surgical guidance duringExternal Ventricular Drain (EVD) surgery, reducing the risks of misplacement inmanual operations.

Artifacts in histopathology arise through a complex combination offactors relating to tissue collection and laboratory processing, as well asfactors intrinsic to patient samples. In fluorescence imaging, these artifactsstem from variations across experimental batches. The complexity and subtletyof these artifacts make the enumeration of data domains intractable. Therefore,augmentation-based methods of domain generalization that require domainidentifiers and manual fine-tuning are inadequate in this setting. To overcomethis challenge, we introduce ContriMix, a domain generalization technique thatlearns to generate synthetic images by disentangling and permuting thebiological content ("content") and technical variations ("attributes") inmicroscopy images. ContriMix does not rely on domain identifiers or handcraftedaugmentations and makes no assumptions about the input characteristics ofimages. We assess the performance of ContriMix on two pathology datasets(Camelyon17-WILDS and a prostate cell classification dataset) and onefluorescence microscopy dataset (RxRx1-WILDS). ContriMix outperforms currentstate-of-the-art methods in all datasets, motivating its usage for microscopyimage analysis in real-world settings where domain information is hard to comeby.</description><author>Tan H.

Evaluating Fairness in Large Language Model Recommendation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07609v2</link><description>The remarkable achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to theemergence of a novel recommendation paradigm -- Recommendation via LLM(RecLLM). Nevertheless, it is important to note that LLMs may contain socialprejudices, and therefore, the fairness of recommendations made by RecLLMrequires further investigation. To avoid the potential risks of RecLLM, it isimperative to evaluate the fairness of RecLLM with respect to various sensitiveattributes on the user side. Due to the differences between the RecLLM paradigmand the traditional recommendation paradigm, it is problematic to directly usethe fairness benchmark of traditional recommendation. To address the dilemma,we propose a novel benchmark called Fairness of Recommendation via LLM(FaiRLLM). This benchmark comprises carefully crafted metrics and a datasetthat accounts for eight sensitive attributes1 in two recommendation scenarios:music and movies. By utilizing our FaiRLLM benchmark, we conducted anevaluation of ChatGPT and discovered that it still exhibits unfairness to somesensitive attributes when generating recommendations.

Unlike prior models that rely on iterativeimage warping and inpainting, MVDiffusion concurrently generates all imageswith a global awareness, encompassing high resolution and rich content,effectively addressing the error accumulation prevalent in preceding models.MVDiffusion specifically incorporates a correspondence-aware attentionmechanism, enabling effective cross-view interaction. This mechanism underpinsthree pivotal modules: 1) a generation module that produces low-resolutionimages while maintaining global correspondence, 2) an interpolation module thatdensifies spatial coverage between images, and 3) a super-resolution modulethat upscales into high-resolution outputs. In terms of panoramic imagery,MVDiffusion can generate high-resolution photorealistic images up to1024$\times$1024 pixels. For geometry-conditioned multi-view image generation,MVDiffusion demonstrates the first method capable of generating a textured mapof a scene mesh.

We focus on reducing the memory space required for imagestorage while the memory space consumption in the collecting phase limits thetime lasting of this phase leading to the need for more image collectioncampaigns. We present a novel machine-learning model that reconstructs thecolours of underwater images from their luminescence channel, thus saving 2/3of the available storage space. Our model specialises in underwater colourreconstruction and consists of an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder iscomposed of a convolutional encoder and a parallel specialised classifiertrained with webly-supervised data. The encoder and the decoder use layers ofcapsules to capture the features of the entities in the image. The colourreconstruction process recalls the progressive and the generative adversarialtraining procedures. The progressive training gives the ground for a generativeadversarial routine focused on the refining of colours giving the image brightand saturated colours which bring the image back to life. We validate the modelboth qualitatively and quantitatively on four benchmark datasets. This is thefirst attempt at colour reconstruction in greyscale underwater images.Extensive results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our solutionoutperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions. We also demonstrate that thegenerated colourisation enhances the quality of images compared to enhancementmodels at the SOTA.</description><author>Rita Pucci, Niki Martine</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 16:09:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01091v1</guid></item><item><title>Streamlined Lensed Quasar Identification in Multiband Images via Ensemble Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01090v1</link><description>Quasars experiencing strong lensing offer unique viewpoints on subjects likethe cosmic expansion rate, the dark matter profile within the foregrounddeflectors, and the quasar host galaxies. Unfortunately, identifying them inastronomical images is challenging since they are overwhelmed by the abundanceof non-lenses. To address this, we have developed a novel approach byensembling cutting-edge convolutional networks (CNNs) -- i.e., ResNet,Inception, NASNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and RegNet -- along with visiontransformers (ViTs) trained on realistic galaxy-quasar lens simulations basedon the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) multiband images. While the individual modelexhibits remarkable performance when evaluated against the test dataset,achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of $&gt;$97.4%and a median false positive rate of 3.1%, it struggles to generalize in realdata, indicated by numerous spurious sources picked by each classifier. Asignificant improvement is achieved by averaging these CNNs and ViTs, resultingin the impurities being downsized by factors up to 40. Subsequently, combiningthe HSC images with the UKIRT, VISTA, and unWISE data, we retrieveapproximately 60 million sources as parent samples and reduce this to 892,609after employing a photometry preselection to discover $z&gt;1.5$ lensed quasarswith Einstein radii of $\theta_\mathrm{E}&lt;5$ arcsec. Afterward, the ensembleclassifier indicates 3991 sources with a high probability of being lenses, forwhich we visually inspect, yielding 161 prevailing candidates awaitingspectroscopic confirmation. These outcomes suggest that automated deep learningpipelines hold great potential in effectively detecting strong lenses in vastdatasets with minimal manual visual inspection involved.</description><author>Irham Taufik Andika, Sherry H.

However, when they are trained on non-stationary streamsof data and in an online fashion, their performance is reduced (1) by theonline setup, which limits the availability of data, (2) due to catastrophicforgetting because of the non-stationary nature of the data. Furthermore,several recent works (Caccia et al., 2022; Lange et al., 2023) arXiv:2205.13452showed that replay methods used in continual learning suffer from the stabilitygap, encountered when evaluating the model continually (rather than only ontask boundaries).

Wenotice that naively ensembling models coming from a variety of training tasksincreases the performance in online continual learning considerably.

We demonstrate that our system is real-time in the context of theLOFAR data processing pipeline, requiring &lt;1ms to process a single spectrogram.Furthermore, ROAD obtains an anomaly detection F-2 score of 0.92 whilemaintaining a false positive rate of ~2\%, as well as a mean per-classclassification F-2 score 0.89, outperforming other related works.</description><author>Michael Mesarcik, Albert-Jan Boonstra, Marco Iacobelli, Elena Ranguelova, Cees de Laat, Rob van Nieuwpoort</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 15:34:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01054v1</guid></item><item><title>ENGAGE: Explanation Guided Data Augmentation for Graph Representation Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01053v1</link><description>The recent contrastive learning methods, due to their effectiveness inrepresentation learning, have been widely applied to modeling graph data.Random perturbation is widely used to build contrastive views for graph data,which however, could accidentally break graph structures and lead to suboptimalperformance. In addition, graph data is usually highly abstract, so it is hardto extract intuitive meanings and design more informed augmentation schemes.Effective representations should preserve key characteristics in data andabandon superfluous information. In this paper, we propose ENGAGE (ExplaNationGuided data AuGmEntation), where explanation guides the contrastiveaugmentation process to preserve the key parts in graphs and explore removingsuperfluous information. Specifically, we design an efficient unsupervisedexplanation method called smoothed activation map as the indicator of nodeimportance in representation learning. Then, we design two data augmentationschemes on graphs for perturbing structural and feature information,respectively. We also provide justification for the proposed method in theframework of information theories. Experiments of both graph-level andnode-level tasks, on various model architectures and on different real-worldgraphs, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility ofENGAGE.

In this paper, we fill this gapby creating an MQM dataset consisting of 7000 fine-grained annotations,spanning 5 Indian languages and 7 MT systems, and use it to establishcorrelations between annotator scores and scores obtained using existingautomatic metrics. Our results show that pre-trained metrics, such as COMET,have the highest correlations with annotator scores. Additionally, we find thatthe metrics do not adequately capture fluency-based errors in Indian languages,and there is a need to develop metrics focused on Indian languages. We hopethat our dataset and analysis will help promote further research in this area.</description><author>Ananya B.

Eventcameras are interesting alternatives to frame-based sensors as their highdynamic range enables robust perception in difficult illumination conditions.However, current event-based place recognition methods only rely on eventinformation, which restricts downstream applications of VPR. In this paper, wepresent the first cross-modal visual place recognition framework that iscapable of retrieving regular images from a database given an event query.

QR is limited by the assumption that the target distribution isunivariate and defined on an Euclidean domain. Although the notion of quantileswas recently extended to multi-variate distributions, QR for multi-variatedistributions on manifolds remains underexplored, even though many importantapplications inherently involve data distributed on, e.g., spheres (climatemeasurements), tori (dihedral angles in proteins), or Lie groups (attitude innavigation). By leveraging optimal transport theory and the notion of$c$-concave functions, we meaningfully define conditional vector quantilefunctions of high-dimensional variables on manifolds (M-CVQFs). Our approachallows for quantile estimation, regression, and computation of conditionalconfidence sets. We demonstrate the approach's efficacy and provide insightsregarding the meaning of non-Euclidean quantiles through preliminary syntheticdata experiments.</description><author>Marco Pegoraro, Sanketh Vedula, Aviv A.

Recently, the emergenceof Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5, ChatGPT and GPT-4, hasattracted wide attention from the computational linguistics community. However,it is not yet known the performance of LLMs on CLS. In this report, weempirically use various prompts to guide LLMs to perform zero-shot CLS fromdifferent paradigms (i.e., end-to-end and pipeline), and provide a preliminaryevaluation on the generated summaries. We find that ChatGPT and GPT-4originally prefer to produce lengthy summaries with detailed information. Thesetwo LLMs can further balance informativeness and conciseness with the help ofan interactive prompt, significantly improving their CLS performance.Experimental results on three widely-used CLS datasets show that GPT-4 achievesstate-of-the-art zero-shot CLS performance, and performs competitively comparedwith the fine-tuned mBART-50. Moreover, we also find some multi-lingual andbilingual LLMs (i.e., BLOOMZ, ChatGLM-6B, Vicuna-13B and ChatYuan) have limitedzero-shot CLS ability. Due to the composite nature of CLS, which requiresmodels to perform summarization and translation simultaneously, accomplishingthis task in a zero-shot manner is even a challenge for LLMs. Therefore, wesincerely hope and recommend future LLM research could use CLS as a testbed.</description><author>Jiaan Wang, Yunlong Liang, Fandong Meng, Beiqi Zou, Zhixu Li, Jianfeng Qu, Jie Zhou</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 15:11:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14229v3</guid></item><item><title>Bipol: Multi-axes Evaluation of Bias with Explainability in Benchmark Datasets</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12139v2</link><description>We investigate five English NLP benchmark datasets (on the superGLUEleaderboard) and two Swedish datasets for bias, along multiple axes.

However, the state-of-the-art(SOTA) DA still lacks the potential object with accurate pixel-level locationand boundary to generate the high-quality target domain training sample. Thiskey issue constrains the transfer learning of the real-time daytime SOTAtrackers for challenging nighttime UAV tracking. Recently, the notable SegmentAnything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable zero-shot generalization abilityto discover abundant potential objects due to its huge data-driven trainingapproach. To solve the aforementioned issue, this work proposes a novelSAM-powered DA framework for real-time nighttime UAV tracking, i.e., SAM-DA.Specifically, an innovative SAM-powered target domain training sample swellingis designed to determine enormous high-quality target domain training samplesfrom every single raw nighttime image. This novel one-to-many methodsignificantly expands the high-quality target domain training sample for DA.Comprehensive experiments on extensive nighttime UAV videos prove therobustness and domain adaptability of SAM-DA for nighttime UAV tracking.Especially, compared to the SOTA DA, SAM-DA can achieve better performance withfewer raw nighttime images, i.e., the fewer-better training. This economizedtraining approach facilitates the quick validation and deployment of algorithmsfor UAVs.

Extractingcomplex urban buildings involves the segmentation of very high-resolution (VHR)earth observation (EO) images. U-Net is a common deep learning network andfoundation for its new incarnations like ResUnet, U-Net++ and U-Net3+ for suchsegmentation. The re-incarnations look for efficiency gain by re-designing theskip connection component and exploiting the multi-scale features in U-Net.However, skip connections do not always improve these networks and removingsome of them provides efficiency gains and reduced network parameters. In thispaper, we propose three dual skip connection mechanisms for U-Net, ResUnet, andU-Net3+. These mechanisms deepen the feature maps forwarded by the skipconnections and allow us to study which skip connections need to be denser toyield the highest efficiency gain. The mechanisms are evaluated on feature mapsof different scales in the three networks, producing nine new networkconfigurations. The networks are evaluated against their original vanillaversions using four building footprint datasets (three existing and one new) ofdifferent spatial resolutions: VHR (0.3m), high-resolution (1m and 1.2m), andmulti-resolution (0.3+0.6+1.2m).

In this study, we propose an interactivesegmentation method that allows users to refine the output of deep neuralnetworks through click-type user interactions. The primary method is toformulate interactive segmentation as an optimization problem that leveragesboth user-provided click constraints and semantic information in a feature mapusing a click-guided attention module (CGAM). Unlike other existing methods,CGAM avoids excessive changes in segmentation results, which can lead to theoverfitting of user clicks.

This side effect negatively impacts the model'sability to format responses appropriately -- for instance, its "politeness" --due to the overly succinct and unformatted nature of raw annotations, resultingin reduced human preference. In this paper, we introduce Polite Flamingo, amulti-modal response rewriter that transforms raw annotations into a moreappealing, "polite" format. Polite Flamingo is trained to reconstructhigh-quality responses from their automatically distorted counterparts and issubsequently applied to a vast array of vision-language datasets for responserewriting.

Existingliterature on proxy metrics concentrates mainly on the estimation of thelong-term impact from short-term experimental data. In this paper, instead, wefocus on the trade-off between the estimation of the long-term impact and thesensitivity in the short term. In particular, we propose the Pareto optimalproxy metrics method, which simultaneously optimizes prediction accuracy andsensitivity. In addition, we give an efficient multi-objective optimizationalgorithm that outperforms standard methods. We applied our methodology toexperiments from a large industrial recommendation system, and found proxymetrics that are eight times more sensitive than the north star andconsistently moved in the same direction, increasing the velocity and thequality of the decisions to launch new features.</description><author>Lee Richardson, Alessandro Zito, Dylan Greaves, Jacopo Soriano</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 14:29:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01000v1</guid></item><item><title>RefSAM: Efficiently Adapting Segmenting Anything Model for Referring Video Object Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00997v1</link><description>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has gained significant attention for itsimpressive performance in image segmentation. However, it lacks proficiency inreferring video object segmentation (RVOS) due to the need for preciseuser-interactive prompts and limited understanding of different modalities,such as language and vision. This paper presents the RefSAM model, which forthe first time explores the potential of SAM for RVOS by incorporatingmulti-view information from diverse modalities and successive frames atdifferent timestamps. Our proposed approach adapts the original SAM model toenhance cross-modality learning by employing a lightweight Cross-Modal MLP thatprojects the text embedding of the referring expression into sparse and denseembeddings, serving as user-interactive prompts. Subsequently, aparameter-efficient tuning strategy is employed to effectively align and fusethe language and vision features. Through comprehensive ablation studies, wedemonstrate the practical and effective design choices of our strategy.Extensive experiments conducted on Ref-Youtu-VOS and Ref-DAVIS17 datasetsvalidate the superiority and effectiveness of our RefSAM model over existingmethods.

However, while the prior work has revealed valuable insight intounderstanding the behavior of BD patients on social media, little attention hasbeen paid to developing a model that can predict the future suicidality of a BDpatient. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-task learning model forpredicting the future suicidality of BD patients by jointly learning currentsymptoms. We build a novel BD dataset clinically validated by psychiatrists,including 14 years of posts on bipolar-related subreddits written by 818 BDpatients, along with the annotations of future suicidality and BD symptoms. Wealso suggest a temporal symptom-aware attention mechanism to determine whichsymptoms are the most influential for predicting future suicidality over timethrough a sequence of BD posts. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposedmodel outperforms the state-of-the-art models in both BD symptom identificationand future suicidality prediction tasks. In addition, the proposed temporalsymptom-aware attention provides interpretable attention weights, helpingclinicians to apprehend BD patients more comprehensively and to provide timelyintervention by tracking mental state progression.</description><author>Daeun Lee, Sejung Son, Hyolim Jeon, Seungbae Kim, Jinyoung Han</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 14:18:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00995v1</guid></item><item><title>Environmental effects on emergent strategy in micro-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00994v1</link><description>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a promising candidate forrealizing efficient control of microscopic particles, of which micro-robots area subset. However, the microscopic particles' environment presents uniquechallenges, such as Brownian motion at sufficiently small length-scales. Inthis work, we explore the role of temperature in the emergence and efficacy ofstrategies in MARL systems using particle-based Langevin molecular dynamicssimulations as a realistic representation of micro-scale environments. To thisend, we perform experiments on two different multi-agent tasks in microscopicenvironments at different temperatures, detecting the source of a concentrationgradient and rotation of a rod. We find that at higher temperatures, the RLagents identify new strategies for achieving these tasks, highlighting theimportance of understanding this regime and providing insight into optimaltraining strategies for bridging the generalization gap between simulation andreality. We also introduce a novel Python package for studying microscopicagents using reinforcement learning (RL) to accompany our results.</description><author>Samuel Tovey, David Zimmer, Christoph Lohrmann, Tobias Merkt, Simon Koppenhoefer, Veit-Lorenz Heuthe, Clemens Bechinger, Christian Holm</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 14:18:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00994v1</guid></item><item><title>Derandomized Novelty Detection with FDR Control via Conformal E-values</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07294v2</link><description>Conformal inference provides a general distribution-free method to rigorouslycalibrate the output of any machine learning algorithm for novelty detection.While this approach has many strengths, it has the limitation of beingrandomized, in the sense that it may lead to different results when analyzingtwice the same data, and this can hinder the interpretation of any findings.

Further, we show that the proposed method can reduce randomnesswithout much loss of power compared to standard conformal inference, partlythanks to an innovative way of weighting conformal e-values based on additionalside information carefully extracted from the same data.

RLHF ischallenging for multiple reasons: large state space but limited human feedback,the bounded rationality of human decisions, and the off-policy distributionshift. In this paper, we focus on the Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) model formodeling and understanding human choices. DCC, rooted in econometrics anddecision theory, is widely used to model a human decision-making process withforward-looking and bounded rationality. We propose a\underline{D}ynamic-\underline{C}hoice-\underline{P}essimistic-\underline{P}olicy-\underline{O}ptimization(DCPPO) method. \ The method involves a three-stage process: The first step isto estimate the human behavior policy and the state-action value function viamaximum likelihood estimation (MLE); the second step recovers the human rewardfunction via minimizing Bellman mean squared error using the learned valuefunctions; the third step is to plug in the learned reward and invokepessimistic value iteration for finding a near-optimal policy. With onlysingle-policy coverage (i.e., optimal policy) of the dataset, we prove that thesuboptimality of DCPPO almost matches the classical pessimistic offline RLalgorithm in terms of suboptimality's dependency on distribution shift anddimension. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the firsttheoretical guarantees for off-policy offline RLHF with dynamic discrete choicemodel.</description><author>Zihao Li, Zhuoran Yang, Mengdi Wang</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 14:08:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18438v3</guid></item><item><title>Predicting beauty, liking, and aesthetic quality: A comparative analysis of image databases for visual aesthetics research</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00984v1</link><description>In the fields of Experimental and Computational Aesthetics, numerous imagedatasets have been created over the last two decades. In the present work, weprovide a comparative overview of twelve image datasets that include aestheticratings (beauty, liking or aesthetic quality) and investigate thereproducibility of results across different datasets. Specifically, we examinehow consistently the ratings can be predicted by using either (A) a set of 20previously studied statistical image properties, or (B) the layers of aconvolutional neural network developed for object recognition. Our findingsreveal substantial variation in the predictability of aesthetic ratings acrossthe different datasets. However, consistent similarities were found fordatasets containing either photographs or paintings, suggesting differentrelevant features in the aesthetic evaluation of these two image genres. To oursurprise, statistical image properties and the convolutional neural networkpredict aesthetic ratings with similar accuracy, highlighting a significantoverlap in the image information captured by the two methods. Nevertheless, thediscrepancies between the datasets call into question the generalizability ofprevious research findings on single datasets. Our study underscores theimportance of considering multiple datasets to improve the validity andgeneralizability of research results in the fields of experimental andcomputational aesthetics.</description><author>Ralf Bartho, Katja Thoemmes, Christoph Redies</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 14:03:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00984v1</guid></item><item><title>Cracking Double-Blind Review: Authorship Attribution with Deep Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07467v3</link><description>Double-blind peer review is considered a pillar of academic research becauseit is perceived to ensure a fair, unbiased, and fact-centered scientificdiscussion. Yet, experienced researchers can often correctly guess from whichresearch group an anonymous submission originates, biasing the peer-reviewprocess. In this work, we present a transformer-based, neural-networkarchitecture that only uses the text content and the author names in thebibliography to attribute an anonymous manuscript to an author. To train andevaluate our method, we created the largest authorship identification datasetto date. It leverages all research papers publicly available on arXiv amountingto over 2 million manuscripts. In arXiv-subsets with up to 2,000 differentauthors, our method achieves an unprecedented authorship attribution accuracy,where up to 73% of papers are attributed correctly. We present a scalinganalysis to highlight the applicability of the proposed method to even largerdatasets when sufficient compute capabilities are more widely available to theacademic community. Furthermore, we analyze the attribution accuracy insettings where the goal is to identify all authors of an anonymous manuscript.Thanks to our method, we are not only able to predict the author of ananonymous work, but we also provide empirical evidence of the key aspects thatmake a paper attributable.

With the developmentof the machine learning and neuroimaging technology, extensive research hasbeen conducted on machine classification of ASD based on structural MRI(s-MRI). However, most studies involve with datasets where participants' ageare above 5. Few studies conduct machine classification of ASD for participantsbelow 5-year-old, but, with mediocre predictive accuracy. In this paper, wepush the boundary of predictive accuracy (above 0.97) of machine classificationof ASD in children (age range: 0.92-4.83 years), based on s-MRI featuresextracted using contrastive variational autoencoder (CVAE). 78 s-MRI, collectedfrom Shenzhen Children's Hospital, are used for training CVAE, which consistsof both ASD-specific feature channel and common shared feature channel. The ASDparticipants represented by ASD-specific features can be easily discriminatedfrom TC participants represented by the common shared features, leading to highclassification accuracy. In case of degraded predictive accuracy when data sizeis extremely small, a transfer learning strategy is proposed here as apotential solution. Finally, we conduct neuroanatomical interpretation based onthe correlation between s-MRI features extracted from CVAE and surface area ofdifferent cortical regions, which discloses potential biomarkers that couldhelp target treatments of ASD in the future.</description><author>Ruimin Ma, Ruitao Xie, Yanlin Wang, Jintao Meng, Yanjie Wei, Wenhui Xi, Yi Pan</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 13:46:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00976v1</guid></item><item><title>Over-The-Air Federated Learning: Status Quo, Open Challenges, and Future Directions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00974v1</link><description>The development of applications based on artificial intelligence andimplemented over wireless networks is increasingly rapidly and is expected togrow dramatically in the future. The resulting demand for the aggregation oflarge amounts of data has caused serious communication bottlenecks in wirelessnetworks and particularly at the network edge. Over-the-air federated learning(OTA-FL), leveraging the superposition feature of multi-access channels (MACs),enables users at the network edge to share spectrum resources and achievesefficient and low-latency global model aggregation. This paper provides aholistic review of progress in OTA-FL and points to potential future researchdirections. Specifically, we classify OTA-FL from the perspective of systemsettings, including single-antenna OTA-FL, multi-antenna OTA-FL, and OTA-FLwith the aid of the emerging reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)technology, and the contributions of existing works in these areas aresummarized. Moreover, we discuss the trust, security and privacy aspects ofOTA-FL, and highlight concerns arising from security and privacy. Finally,challenges and potential research directions are discussed to promote thefuture development of OTA-FL in terms of improving system performance,reliability, and trustworthiness. Specifical challenges to be addressed includemodel distortion under channel fading, the ineffective OTA aggregation of localmodels trained on substantially unbalanced data, and the limited accessibilityand verifiability of individual local models.</description><author>Bingnan Xiao, Xichen Yu, Wei Ni, Xin Wang, H.

To achieve this, AL typically measures the informativeness ofunlabeled instances based on uncertainty and diversity. However, it does notconsider erroneous instances with their neighborhood error density, which havegreat potential to improve the model performance. To address this limitation,we propose $REAL$, a novel approach to select data instances with$\underline{R}$epresentative $\underline{E}$rrors for $\underline{A}$ctive$\underline{L}$earning. It identifies minority predictions as \emph{pseudoerrors} within a cluster and allocates an adaptive sampling budget for thecluster based on estimated error density. Extensive experiments on five textclassification datasets demonstrate that $REAL$ consistently outperforms allbest-performing baselines regarding accuracy and F1-macro scores across a widerange of hyperparameter settings. Our analysis also shows that $REAL$ selectsthe most representative pseudo errors that match the distribution ofground-truth errors along the decision boundary.

Currentresearch on AD diagnosis models usually regards the diagnosis task as a typicalclassification task with two primary assumptions: 1) All target categories areknown a priori; 2) The diagnostic strategy for each patient is consistent, thatis, the number and type of model input data for each patient are the same.However, real-world clinical settings are open, with complexity and uncertaintyin terms of both subjects and the resources of the medical institutions. Thismeans that diagnostic models may encounter unseen disease categories and needto dynamically develop diagnostic strategies based on the subject's specificcircumstances and available medical resources. Thus, the AD diagnosis task istangled and coupled with the diagnosis strategy formulation. To promote theapplication of diagnostic systems in real-world clinical settings, we proposeOpenClinicalAI for direct AD diagnosis in complex and uncertain clinicalsettings. This is the first powerful end-to-end model to dynamically formulatediagnostic strategies and provide diagnostic results based on the subject'sconditions and available medical resources. OpenClinicalAI combinesreciprocally coupled deep multiaction reinforcement learning (DMARL) fordiagnostic strategy formulation and multicenter meta-learning (MCML) foropen-set recognition. The experimental results show that OpenClinicalAIachieves better performance and fewer clinical examinations than thestate-of-the-art model. Our method provides an opportunity to embed the ADdiagnostic system into the current health care system to cooperate withclinicians to improve current health care.</description><author>Yunyou Huang, Xiaoshuang Liang, Xiangjiang Lu, Xiuxia Miao, Jiyue Xie, Wenjing Liu, Fan Zhang, Guoxin Kang, Li Ma, Suqin Tang, Zhifei Zhang, Jianfeng Zhan</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 13:35:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00965v1</guid></item></channel></rss>
