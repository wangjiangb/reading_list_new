In thispaper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed forlarge-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Ourframework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2Dimages, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-qualitycontrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representationlearning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. Weintroduce several key innovations: i) VFM-driven superpixel generation fordetailed semantic representation, ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learningstrategy to align multimodal features, iii) superpoint temporal consistency tomaintain stable representations across time, and iv) multi-source datapretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approachdelivers significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods inboth linear probing and fine-tuning tasks for both LiDAR-based segmentation andobject detection. Extensive experiments on eleven large-scale multi-modaldatasets highlight our superior performance, demonstrating the adaptability,efficiency, and robustness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.</description><author>Lingdong Kong, Xiang Xu, Youquan Liu, Jun Cen, Runnan Chen, Wenwei Zhang, Liang Pan, Kai Chen, Ziwei Liu</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 18:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04005v1</guid></item><item><title>LiMoE: Mixture of LiDAR Representation Learners from Automotive Scenes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04004v1</link><description>LiDAR data pretraining offers a promising approach to leveraging large-scale,readily available datasets for enhanced data utilization. However, existingmethods predominantly focus on sparse voxel representation, overlooking thecomplementary attributes provided by other LiDAR representations. In this work,we propose LiMoE, a framework that integrates the Mixture of Experts (MoE)paradigm into LiDAR data representation learning to synergistically combinemultiple representations, such as range images, sparse voxels, and raw points.Our approach consists of three stages: i) Image-to-LiDAR Pretraining, whichtransfers prior knowledge from images to point clouds across differentrepresentations; ii) Contrastive Mixture Learning (CML), which uses MoE toadaptively activate relevant attributes from each representation and distillsthese mixed features into a unified 3D network; iii) Semantic MixtureSupervision (SMS), which combines semantic logits from multiple representationsto boost downstream segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across 11large-scale LiDAR datasets demonstrate our effectiveness and superiority. Thecode and model checkpoints have been made publicly accessible.</description><author>Xiang Xu, Lingdong Kong, Hui Shuai, Liang Pan, Ziwei Liu, Qingshan Liu</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 18:59:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04004v1</guid></item><item><title>Are VLMs Ready for Autonomous Driving? An Empirical Study from the Reliability, Data, and Metric Perspectives</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04003v1</link><description>Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have sparked interest intheir use for autonomous driving, particularly in generating interpretabledriving decisions through natural language. However, the assumption that VLMsinherently provide visually grounded, reliable, and interpretable explanationsfor driving remains largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduceDriveBench, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate VLM reliability across 17settings (clean, corrupted, and text-only inputs), encompassing 19,200 frames,20,498 question-answer pairs, three question types, four mainstream drivingtasks, and a total of 12 popular VLMs. Our findings reveal that VLMs oftengenerate plausible responses derived from general knowledge or textual cuesrather than true visual grounding, especially under degraded or missing visualinputs. This behavior, concealed by dataset imbalances and insufficientevaluation metrics, poses significant risks in safety-critical scenarios likeautonomous driving. We further observe that VLMs struggle with multi-modalreasoning and display heightened sensitivity to input corruptions, leading toinconsistencies in performance. To address these challenges, we propose refinedevaluation metrics that prioritize robust visual grounding and multi-modalunderstanding. Additionally, we highlight the potential of leveraging VLMs'awareness of corruptions to enhance their reliability, offering a roadmap fordeveloping more trustworthy and interpretable decision-making systems inreal-world autonomous driving contexts. The benchmark toolkit is publiclyaccessible.</description><author>Shaoyuan Xie, Lingdong Kong, Yuhao Dong, Chonghao Sima, Wenwei Zhang, Qi Alfred Chen, Ziwei Liu, Liang Pan</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 18:59:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04003v1</guid></item><item><title>Extraction Of Cumulative Blobs From Dynamic Gestures</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04002v1</link><description>Gesture recognition is a perceptual user interface, which is based on CVtechnology that allows the computer to interpret human motions as commands,allowing users to communicate with a computer without the use of hands, thusmaking the mouse and keyboard superfluous. Gesture recognition's main weaknessis a light condition because gesture control is based on computer vision, whichheavily relies on cameras. These cameras are used to interpret gestures in 2Dand 3D, so the extracted information can vary depending on the source of light.The limitation of the system cannot work in a dark environment. A simple nightvision camera can be used as our camera for motion capture as they also blastout infrared light which is not visible to humans but can be clearly seen witha camera that has no infrared filter this majorly overcomes the limitation ofsystems which cannot work in a dark environment. So, the video stream from thecamera is fed into a Raspberry Pi which has a Python program running OpenCVmodule which is used for detecting, isolating and tracking the path of dynamicgesture, then we use an algorithm of machine learning to recognize the patterndrawn and accordingly control the GPIOs of the raspberry pi to perform someactivities.</description><author>Rishabh Naulakha, Shubham Gaur, Dhairya Lodha, Mehek Tulsyan, Utsav Kotecha</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 18:59:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04002v1</guid></item><item><title>Sa2VA: Marrying SAM2 with LLaVA for Dense Grounded Understanding of Images and Videos</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04001v1</link><description>This work presents Sa2VA, the first unified model for dense groundedunderstanding of both images and videos. Unlike existing multi-modal largelanguage models, which are often limited to specific modalities and tasks,Sa2VA supports a wide range of image and video tasks, including referringsegmentation and conversation, with minimal one-shot instruction tuning. Sa2VAcombines SAM-2, a foundation video segmentation model, with LLaVA, an advancedvision-language model, and unifies text, image, and video into a shared LLMtoken space. Using the LLM, Sa2VA generates instruction tokens that guide SAM-2in producing precise masks, enabling a grounded, multi-modal understanding ofboth static and dynamic visual content. Additionally, we introduce Ref-SAV, anauto-labeled dataset containing over 72k object expressions in complex videoscenes, designed to boost model performance. We also manually validate 2k videoobjects in the Ref-SAV datasets to benchmark referring video objectsegmentation in complex environments. Experiments show that Sa2VA achievesstate-of-the-art across multiple tasks, particularly in referring video objectsegmentation, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.</description><author>Haobo Yuan, Xiangtai Li, Tao Zhang, Zilong Huang, Shilin Xu, Shunping Ji, Yunhai Tong, Lu Qi, Jiashi Feng, Ming-Hsuan Yang</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 18:58:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04001v1</guid></item><item><title>λ: A Benchmark for Data-Efficiency in Long-Horizon Indoor Mobile Manipulation Robotics</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05313v3</link><description>Efficiently learning and executing long-horizon mobile manipulation (MoMa)tasks is crucial for advancing robotics in household and workplace settings.However, current MoMa models are data-inefficient, underscoring the need forimproved models that require realistic-sized benchmarks to evaluate theirefficiency, which do not exist. To address this, we introduce the LAMBDA({\lambda}) benchmark (Long-horizon Actions for Mobile-manipulationBenchmarking of Directed Activities), which evaluates the data efficiency ofmodels on language-conditioned, long-horizon, multi-room, multi-floor,pick-and-place tasks using a dataset of manageable size, more feasible forcollection. The benchmark includes 571 human-collected demonstrations thatprovide realism and diversity in simulated and real-world settings. Unlikeplanner-generated data, these trajectories offer natural variability andreplay-verifiability, ensuring robust learning and evaluation. We benchmarkseveral models, including learning-based models and a neuro-symbolic modularapproach combining foundation models with task and motion planning.Learning-based models show suboptimal success rates, even when leveragingpretrained weights, underscoring significant data inefficiencies. However, theneuro-symbolic approach performs significantly better while being more dataefficient. Findings highlight the need for more data-efficient learning-basedMoMa approaches. {\lambda} addresses this gap by serving as a key benchmark forevaluating the data efficiency of those future models in handling householdrobotics tasks.</description><author>Ahmed Jaafar, Shreyas Sundara Raman, Yichen Wei, Sudarshan Harithas, Sofia Juliani, Anneke Wernerfelt, Benedict Quartey, Ifrah Idrees, Jason Xinyu Liu, Stefanie Tellex</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 18:57:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05313v3</guid></item><item><title>A Survey on Federated Learning in Human Sensing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04000v1</link><description>Human Sensing, a field that leverages technology to monitor human activities,psycho-physiological states, and interactions with the environment, enhancesour understanding of human behavior and drives the development of advancedservices that improve overall quality of life. However, its reliance ondetailed and often privacy-sensitive data as the basis for its machine learning(ML) models raises significant legal and ethical concerns. The recentlyproposed ML approach of Federated Learning (FL) promises to alleviate many ofthese concerns, as it is able to create accurate ML models without sending rawuser data to a central server. While FL has demonstrated its usefulness acrossa variety of areas, such as text prediction and cyber security, its benefits inHuman Sensing are under-explored, given the particular challenges in thisdomain. This survey conducts a comprehensive analysis of the currentstate-of-the-art studies on FL in Human Sensing, and proposes a taxonomy and aneight-dimensional assessment for FL approaches. Through the eight-dimensionalassessment, we then evaluate whether the surveyed studies consider a specificFL-in-Human-Sensing challenge or not. Finally, based on the overall analysis,we discuss open challenges and highlight five research aspects related to FL inHuman Sensing that require urgent research attention. Our work provides acomprehensive corpus of FL studies and aims to assist FL practitioners indeveloping and evaluating solutions that effectively address the real-worldcomplexities of Human Sensing.</description><author>Mohan Li, Martin Gjoreski, Pietro Barbiero, Gašper Slapničar, Mitja Luštrek, Nicholas D.

In cases where limitedinteractions are available due to external factors, such as the cost ofconducting experiments, recommenders often face constraints due to the smallnumber of user interactions. In addition, there is a trade-off betweenselecting the best treatment and the ability to personalize and contextualizebased on individual factors. A popular solution to this dilemma is theContextual Bandit framework. It aims to maximize outcomes while incorporatingpersonalization (contextual) factors, customizing treatments such as a user'sprofile to individual preferences. Despite their advantages, Contextual Banditalgorithms face challenges like measurement bias and the 'curse ofdimensionality.' These issues complicate the management of numerousinterventions and often lead to data sparsity through participant segmentation.To address these problems, we introduce the Weighted Allocation ProbabilityAdjusted Thompson Sampling (WAPTS) algorithm. WAPTS builds on the contextualThompson Sampling method by using a dynamic weighting parameter. This improvesthe allocation process for interventions and enables rapid optimization indata-sparse environments. We demonstrate the performance of our approach ondifferent numbers of arms and effect sizes.</description><author>Haochen Song, Ilya Musabirov, Ananya Bhattacharjee, Audrey Durand, Meredith Franklin, Anna Rafferty, Joseph Jay Williams</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 18:55:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03999v1</guid></item><item><title>RAG-Check: Evaluating Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Performance</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03995v1</link><description>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves large language models (LLMs) byusing external knowledge to guide response generation, reducing hallucinations.However, RAG, particularly multi-modal RAG, can introduce new hallucinationsources: (i) the retrieval process may select irrelevant pieces (e.g.,documents, images) as raw context from the database, and (ii) retrieved imagesare processed into text-based context via vision-language models (VLMs) ordirectly used by multi-modal language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o, which mayhallucinate. To address this, we propose a novel framework to evaluate thereliability of multi-modal RAG using two performance measures: (i) therelevancy score (RS), assessing the relevance of retrieved entries to thequery, and (ii) the correctness score (CS), evaluating the accuracy of thegenerated response. We train RS and CS models using a ChatGPT-derived databaseand human evaluator samples. Results show that both models achieve ~88%accuracy on test data. Additionally, we construct a 5000-sample human-annotateddatabase evaluating the relevancy of retrieved pieces and the correctness ofresponse statements. Our RS model aligns with human preferences 20% more oftenthan CLIP in retrieval, and our CS model matches human preferences ~91% of thetime. Finally, we assess various RAG systems' selection and generationperformances using RS and CS.</description><author>Matin Mortaheb, Mohammad A. Amir Khojastepour, Srimat T.

However, the adoption of these modelsin financial applications has not kept pace with the growing interest, probablydue to the unique complexities and challenges of financial markets. This paperaims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the limitations of generativemodels, particularly in portfolio and risk management. To this end, we begin bypresenting theoretical results on the importance of initial sample size, andpoint out the potential pitfalls of generating far more data than originallyavailable. We then highlight the inseparable nature of model development andthe desired use case by touching on a paradox: generic generative modelsinherently care less about what is important for constructing portfolios (inparticular the long-short ones). Based on these findings, we propose a pipelinefor the generation of multivariate returns that meets conventional evaluationstandards on a large universe of US equities while being compliant withstylized facts observed in asset returns and turning around the pitfalls wepreviously identified. Moreover, we insist on the need for more delicateevaluation methods, and suggest, through an example of mean-reversionstrategies, a method designed to identify poor models for a given applicationbased on regurgitative training, i.e. retraining the model using the data ithas itself generated, which is commonly referred to in statistics asidentifiability.</description><author>Adil Rengim Cetingoz, Charles-Albert Lehalle</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 18:50:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03993v1</guid></item><item><title>NeuralSVG: An Implicit Representation for Text-to-Vector Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03992v1</link><description>Vector graphics are essential in design, providing artists with a versatilemedium for creating resolution-independent and highly editable visual content.Recent advancements in vision-language and diffusion models have fueledinterest in text-to-vector graphics generation. However, existing approachesoften suffer from over-parameterized outputs or treat the layered structure - acore feature of vector graphics - as a secondary goal, diminishing theirpractical use. Recognizing the importance of layered SVG representations, wepropose NeuralSVG, an implicit neural representation for generating vectorgraphics from text prompts. Inspired by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs),NeuralSVG encodes the entire scene into the weights of a small MLP network,optimized using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To encourage a layeredstructure in the generated SVG, we introduce a dropout-based regularizationtechnique that strengthens the standalone meaning of each shape. Weadditionally demonstrate that utilizing a neural representation provides anadded benefit of inference-time control, enabling users to dynamically adaptthe generated SVG based on user-provided inputs, all with a single learnedrepresentation. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, wedemonstrate that NeuralSVG outperforms existing methods in generatingstructured and flexible SVG.</description><author>Sagi Polaczek, Yuval Alaluf, Elad Richardson, Yael Vinker, Daniel Cohen-Or</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 18:50:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03992v1</guid></item><item><title>ImageFlowNet: Forecasting Multiscale Image-Level Trajectories of Disease Progression with Irregularly-Sampled Longitudinal Medical Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14794v5</link><description>Advances in medical imaging technologies have enabled the collection oflongitudinal images, which involve repeated scanning of the same patients overtime, to monitor disease progression. However, predictive modeling of such dataremains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and datasparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel modeldesigned to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preservingspatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representationspaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic orstochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterizedneural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to createrobust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combiningknowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support ourformulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-levelvisual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. Wevalidate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depictingprogression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma,demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression andoutperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development ofImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation onreal-world datasets.

Weadditionally investigate if incorporating the response agreement of multipleLLMs and an appropriate loss function can improve calibration performance.Concretely, we build Calib-n, a novel framework that trains an auxiliary modelfor confidence estimation that aggregates responses from multiple LLMs tocapture inter-model agreement. To optimize calibration, we integrate focal andAUC surrogate losses alongside binary cross-entropy. Experiments across fourdatasets demonstrate that both response agreement and focal loss improvecalibration from baselines. We find that few-shot prompts are the mosteffective for auxiliary model-based methods, and auxiliary models demonstraterobust calibration performance across accuracy variations, outperforming LLMs'internal probabilities and verbalized confidences. These insights deepen theunderstanding of influence factors in LLM calibration, supporting theirreliable deployment in diverse applications.</description><author>Yuxi Xia, Pedro Henrique Luz de Araujo, Klim Zaporojets, Benjamin Roth</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 18:48:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03991v1</guid></item><item><title>Semantically Cohesive Word Grouping in Indian Languages</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03988v1</link><description>Indian languages are inflectional and agglutinative and typically followclause-free word order. The structure of sentences across most major Indianlanguages are similar when their dependency parse trees are considered. Whilesome differences in the parsing structure occur due to peculiarities of alanguage or its preferred natural way of conveying meaning, several apparentdifferences are simply due to the granularity of representation of the smallestsemantic unit of processing in a sentence. The semantic unit is typically aword, typographically separated by whitespaces. A single whitespace-separatedword in one language may correspond to a group of words in another. Hence,grouping of words based on semantics helps unify the parsing structure ofparallel sentences across languages and, in the process, morphology. In thiswork, we propose word grouping as a major preprocessing step for anycomputational or linguistic processing of sentences for Indian languages. AmongIndian languages, since Hindi is one of the least agglutinative, we expect itto benefit the most from word-grouping. Hence, in this paper, we focus on Hindito study the effects of grouping. We perform quantitative assessment of ourproposal with an intrinsic method that perturbs sentences by shuffling words aswell as an extrinsic evaluation that verifies the importance of word groupingfor the task of Machine Translation (MT) using decomposed prompting. We alsoqualitatively analyze certain aspects of the syntactic structure of sentences.Our experiments and analyses show that the proposed grouping technique bringsuniformity in the syntactic structures, as well as aids underlying NLP tasks.</description><author>N J Karthika, Adyasha Patra, Nagasai Saketh Naidu, Arnab Bhattacharya, Ganesh Ramakrishnan, Chaitali Dangarikar</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 18:46:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03988v1</guid></item><item><title>Multimodal Machine Learning Can Predict Videoconference Fluidity and Enjoyment</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03190v2</link><description>Videoconferencing is now a frequent mode of communication in bothprofessional and informal settings, yet it often lacks the fluidity andenjoyment of in-person conversation.

Current architectures either share the encoder output, decoderinput, or both across modalities to learn a shared representation. Sucharchitectures impose hard constraints on the model. In this work, we show thata better latent representation can be obtained by replacing these hardconstraints with a soft constraint. We propose a new mixture-of-experts prior,softly guiding each modality's latent representation towards a shared aggregateposterior. This approach results in a superior latent representation and allowseach encoding to preserve information better from its uncompressed originalfeatures.

We thencompared these human responses with outputs from five different LLMs, includingGPT-4o and four LLaVA variants. Our findings reveal a varied degree ofalignment, with LLaVA 34B showing the highest performance but still scoringlow. However, an analysis of the results highlights the models' potential todetect value-laden elements in images, suggesting that with improved trainingand refined prompts, LLMs could enhance applications in social robotics,assistive technologies, and human-computer interaction by providing deeperinsights and more contextually relevant responses.</description><author>Giulio Antonio Abbo, Tony Belpaeme</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 17:37:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03957v1</guid></item><item><title>Constrained Sampling with Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00568v2</link><description>This work considers the problem of sampling from a probability distributionknown up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statisticalconstraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions.This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it canconstrain moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or enforce desideratasuch as prediction fairness. Methods developed to handle support constraints,such as those based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties, are not suited forthis task. This work therefore relies on gradient descent-ascent dynamics inWasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin MonteCarlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distributionand samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under standardassumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong)convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classicaloptimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry ofWasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC inseveral applications.</description><author>Luiz F. O.

We formulate this in terms of Markov categories, which allows us toconsider neural networks whose outputs may be stochastic, but withmeasure-theoretic details abstracted away. We obtain a flexible andcompositional framework for symmetrisation that relies on minimal assumptionsabout the structure of the group and the underlying neural networkarchitecture. Our approach recovers existing canonicalisation and averagingtechniques for symmetrising deterministic models, and extends to provide anovel methodology for symmetrising stochastic models also.

Mostcrucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since theyrely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as theforward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them inproduction. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generativetransformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is amodality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanismsof transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to theoutput prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies aparallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarityneighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text andimage-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms currentstate-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while beingcomputationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large modelinference deployments.</description><author>Björn Deiseroth, Mayukh Deb, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, Patrick Schramowski, Kristian Kersting</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 17:26:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08110v6</guid></item><item><title>Localizing AI: Evaluating Open-Weight Language Models for Languages of Baltic States</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03952v1</link><description>Although large language models (LLMs) have transformed our expectations ofmodern language technologies, concerns over data privacy often restrict the useof commercially available LLMs hosted outside of EU jurisdictions.

Many such methods can be formulated asminimization of a metric or divergence between probability distributions.Recent works have derived statistical error bounds for GANs that are based onintegral probability metrics (IPMs), e.g., WGAN which is based on the1-Wasserstein metric. In general, IPMs are defined by optimizing a linearfunctional (difference of expectations) over a space of discriminators. A muchlarger class of GANs, which we here call $(f,\Gamma)$-GANs, can be constructedusing $f$-divergences (e.g., Jensen-Shannon, KL, or $\alpha$-divergences)together with a regularizing discriminator space $\Gamma$ (e.g., $1$-Lipschitzfunctions). These GANs have nonlinear objective functions, depending on thechoice of $f$, and have been shown to exhibit improved performance in a numberof applications. In this work we derive statistical error bounds for$(f,\Gamma)$-GANs for general classes of $f$ and $\Gamma$ in the form offinite-sample concentration inequalities. These results prove the statisticalconsistency of $(f,\Gamma)$-GANs and reduce to the known results for IPM-GANsin the appropriate limit. Finally, our results also give new insight into theperformance of GANs for distributions with unbounded support.</description><author>Jeremiah Birrell</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 17:05:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16834v2</guid></item><item><title>Synthetic Data Privacy Metrics</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03941v1</link><description>Recent advancements in generative AI have made it possible to createsynthetic datasets that can be as accurate as real-world data for training AImodels, powering statistical insights, and fostering collaboration withsensitive datasets while offering strong privacy guarantees.

However, the task remains challenging, particularly inunseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distributionoutputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as theyencapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diversecorpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalizethese outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of theproblems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metricsacross tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict andshould be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the PerplexityAttention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLMand positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics fromthe next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot,our method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-tokendistribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resourcerequirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performancein-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fractionof their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseendomains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundaryacross distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, andif the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decentgeneralization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1Breaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with ninelanguages.</description><author>Pablo Miralles-González, Javier Huertas-Tato, Alejandro Martín, David Camacho</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 17:00:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03940v1</guid></item><item><title>Vim-F: Visual State Space Model Benefiting from Learning in the Frequency Domain</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18679v2</link><description>In recent years, State Space Models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-awaredesigns, known as the Mamba deep learning models, have made significantprogress in modeling long sequences such as language understanding. Therefore,building efficient and general-purpose visual backbones based on SSMs is apromising direction. Compared to traditional convolutional neural networks(CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), the performance of Vision Mamba (ViM)methods is not yet fully competitive. To enable SSMs to process image data,ViMs typically flatten 2D images into 1D sequences, inevitably ignoring some 2Dlocal dependencies, thereby weakening the model's ability to interpret spatialrelationships from a global perspective. We use Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) toobtain the spectrum of the feature map and add it to the original feature map,enabling ViM to model a unified visual representation in both frequency andspatial domains. The introduction of frequency domain information enables ViMto have a global receptive field during scanning. We propose a novel modelcalled Vim-F, which employs pure Mamba encoders and scans in both the frequencyand spatial domains. Moreover, we question the necessity of position embeddingin ViM and remove it accordingly in Vim-F, which helps to fully utilize theefficient long-sequence modeling capability of ViM. Finally, we redesign apatch embedding for Vim-F, leveraging a convolutional stem to capture morelocal correlations, further improving the performance of Vim-F.

While large language models (LLMs) excel ongenerative tasks, their performance on extractive tasks remains debated.Methods: We investigated Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction(RE) using 1,588 clinical notes from four sources (UT Physicians, MTSamples,MIMIC-III, and i2b2). We developed an annotated corpus covering 4 clinicalentities and 16 modifiers, and compared instruction-tuned LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3against BERT in terms of performance, generalizability, computationalresources, and throughput to BERT. Results: LLaMA models outperformed BERTacross datasets. With sufficient training data, LLaMA showed modestimprovements (1% on NER, 1.5-3.7% on RE); improvements were larger with limitedtraining data. On unseen i2b2 data, LLaMA-3-70B outperformed BERT by 7% (F1) onNER and 4% on RE. However, LLaMA models required more computing resources andran up to 28 times slower. We implemented "Kiwi," a clinical IE packagefeaturing both models, available at https://kiwi.clinicalnlp.org/. Conclusion:This study is among the first to develop and evaluate a comprehensive clinicalIE system using open-source LLMs. Results indicate that LLaMA models outperformBERT for clinical NER and RE but with higher computational costs and lowerthroughputs.

Our results show that DGEand SHAP approaches offer both common and differential sets of altered genesand pathways, reinforcing the usefulness of XAI methods for a broaderperspective of disease.</description><author>Mohammad Usman, Olga Varea, Petia Radeva, Josep Canals, Jordi Abante, Daniel Ortiz</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 16:35:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03923v1</guid></item><item><title>Cosmological Parameter Estimation with Sequential Linear Simulation-based Inference</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03921v1</link><description>We develop the framework of Linear Simulation-based Inference (LSBI), anapplication of simulation-based inference where the likelihood is approximatedby a Gaussian linear function of its parameters.

However, developing federatedunlearning methods presents challenges, particularly in balancing three oftenconflicting objectives: privacy, accuracy, and efficiency. This paper providesa comprehensive analysis of existing federated unlearning approaches, examiningtheir algorithmic efficiency, impact on model accuracy, and effectiveness inpreserving privacy. We discuss key trade-offs among these dimensions andhighlight their implications for practical applications across various domains.Additionally, we propose the OpenFederatedUnlearning framework, a unifiedbenchmark for evaluating federated unlearning methods, incorporating classicbaselines and diverse performance metrics.

Recent worksdemonstrate that various AI-assisted research methods can largely improveresearch efficiency by improving data analysis, accelerating computation, andfostering novel idea generation. To further move towards the ultimate goal(i.e., automatic scientific research), in this paper, we propose Dolphin, thefirst closed-loop open-ended auto-research framework to further build theentire process of human scientific research. Dolphin can generate researchideas, perform experiments, and get feedback from experimental results togenerate higher-quality ideas. More specifically, Dolphin first generates novelideas based on relevant papers which are ranked by the topic and taskattributes. Then, the codes are automatically generated and debugged with theexception-traceback-guided local code structure. Finally, Dolphin automaticallyanalyzes the results of each idea and feeds the results back to the next roundof idea generation. Experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets ofdifferent topics and results show that Dolphin can generate novel ideascontinuously and complete the experiment in a loop. We highlight that Dolphincan automatically propose methods that are comparable to the state-of-the-artin some tasks such as 2D image classification and 3D point classification.</description><author>Jiakang Yuan, Xiangchao Yan, Botian Shi, Tao Chen, Wanli Ouyang, Bo Zhang, Lei Bai, Yu Qiao, Bowen Zhou</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 16:31:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03916v1</guid></item><item><title>HYB-VITON: A Hybrid Approach to Virtual Try-On Combining Explicit and Implicit Warping</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03910v1</link><description>Virtual try-on systems have significant potential in e-commerce, allowingcustomers to visualize garments on themselves.

In this work, weintroduce LMS-AutoTSF, a novel time series forecasting architecture thatincorporates autocorrelation while leveraging dual encoders operating atmultiple scales. Unlike models that rely on predefined trend and seasonalcomponents, LMS-AutoTSF employs two separate encoders per scale: one focusingon low-pass filtering to capture trends and the other utilizing high-passfiltering to model seasonal variations. These filters are learnable, allowingthe model to dynamically adapt and isolate trend and seasonal componentsdirectly in the frequency domain. A key innovation in our approach is theintegration of autocorrelation, achieved by computing lagged differences intime steps, which enables the model to capture dependencies across time moreeffectively. Each encoder processes the input through fully connected layers tohandle temporal and channel interactions. By combining frequency-domainfiltering, autocorrelation-based temporal modeling, and channel-wisetransformations, LMS-AutoTSF not only accurately captures long-termdependencies and fine-grained patterns but also operates more efficientlycompared to other state-of-the-art methods. Its lightweight design ensuresfaster processing while maintaining high precision in forecasting acrossdiverse time horizons.

However,due to the large volume of data, obtaining useful insights through naturallanguage processing technologies such as large language models is challenging.This paper aims to develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecturefor medical question answering pertaining to clinicians' queries on emergingissues associated with health-related topics, using user-generated medicalinformation on social media. We proposed a two-layer RAG framework forquery-focused answer generation and evaluated a proof of concept for theframework in the context of query-focused summary generation from social mediaforums, focusing on emerging drug-related information. Our modular frameworkgenerates individual summaries followed by an aggregated summary to answermedical queries from large amounts of user-generated social media data in anefficient manner. We compared the performance of a quantized large languagemodel (Nous-Hermes-2-7B-DPO), deployable in low-resource settings, with GPT-4.For this proof-of-concept study, we used user-generated data from Reddit toanswer clinicians' questions on the use of xylazine and ketamine. Our frameworkachieves comparable median scores in terms of relevance, length, hallucination,coverage, and coherence when evaluated using GPT-4 and Nous-Hermes-2-7B-DPO,evaluated for 20 queries with 76 samples. There was no statisticallysignificant difference between the two for coverage, coherence, relevance,length, and hallucination. A statistically significant difference was noted forthe Coleman-Liau Index.

Approximate operators, learned from data,hold promise to serve as efficient surrogate models for problems incomputational science and engineering, complementing traditional numericalmethods. However, despite their empirical success, our understanding of theunderpinning mathematical theory is in large part still incomplete. In thispaper, we study the approximation of Lipschitz operators in expectation withrespect to Gaussian measures. We prove higher Gaussian Sobolev regularity ofLipschitz operators and establish lower and upper bounds on the Hermitepolynomial approximation error. We further consider the reconstruction ofLipschitz operators from $m$ arbitrary (adaptive) linear samples. A key findingis the tight characterization of the smallest achievable error for all possible(adaptive) sampling and reconstruction maps in terms of $m$. It is shown thatHermite polynomial approximation is an optimal recovery strategy, but we havethe following curse of sample complexity: No method to approximate Lipschitzoperators based on $m$ samples can achieve algebraic convergence rates in $m$.On the positive side, we prove that a sufficiently fast spectral decay of thecovariance operator of the Gaussian measure guarantees convergence rates whichare arbitrarily close to any algebraic rate in the large data limit $m \to\infty$. A main focus of this work is on the recovery of Lipschitz operatorsfrom finitely many point samples. We use Christoffel sampling and weightedleast-squares approximation to propose an algorithm which provably achievesnear-optimal sample complexity in high probability.</description><author>Ben Adcock, Michael Griebel, Gregor Maier</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 16:07:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23440v2</guid></item><item><title>Finer: Investigating and Enhancing Fine-Grained Visual Concept Recognition in Large Vision Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16315v4</link><description>Recent advances in instruction-tuned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)have imbued the models with the ability to generate high-level, image-groundedexplanations with ease.

In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimalvision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens whilepreserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand visiontokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the earlylayers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into texttokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion tofuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating theextreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token.LLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support theunderstanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficientmanner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarksdemonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision tokeninstead of 576.

More recently, Direct AlignmentAlgorithms (DAAs) have emerged in which the reward modeling stage of RLHF isskipped by characterizing the reward directly as a function of the policy beinglearned. Examples include Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and SimplePreference Optimization (SimPO). These methods often suffer from likelihooddisplacement, a phenomenon by which the probabilities of preferred responsesare often reduced undesirably. In this paper, we argue that, for DAAs the reward (function) shape matters.We introduce AlphaPO, a new DAA method that leverages an $\alpha$-parameter tohelp change the shape of the reward function beyond the standard log reward.AlphaPO helps maintain fine-grained control over likelihood displacement andover-optimization. Compared to SimPO, one of the best performing DAAs, AlphaPOleads to about 7\% to 10\% relative improvement in alignment performance forthe instruct versions of Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B. The analysis and resultspresented highlight the importance of the reward shape, and how one cansystematically change it to affect training dynamics, as well as improvealignment performance.</description><author>Aman Gupta, Shao Tang, Qingquan Song, Sirou Zhu, Jiwoo Hong, Ankan Saha, Viral Gupta, Noah Lee, Eunki Kim, Jason Zhu, Natesh Pillai, S.

A total of 35 healthy volunteers underwent conventional two-foldaccelerated MRCP scans at field strengths of 3T and 0.55T. We trained DLreconstructions using two different training strategies, supervised (SV) andself-supervised (SSV), with retrospectively six-fold undersampled data obtainedat 3T. We then evaluated the DL reconstructions against standard techniques,parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS), focusing on peaksignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) as metrics. Wealso tested DL reconstructions with prospectively accelerated acquisitions andevaluated their robustness when changing fields strengths from 3T to 0.55T. DLreconstructions demonstrated a reduction in average acquisition time from599/542 to 255/180 seconds for MRCP at 3T/0.55T. In both retrospective andprospective undersampling, PSNR and SSIM of DL reconstructions were higher thanthose of PI and CS. At the same time, DL reconstructions preserved the imagequality of undersampled data, including sharpness and the visibility ofhepatobiliary ducts. In addition, both DL approaches produced high-qualityreconstructions at 0.55T. In summary, DL reconstructions trained for highlyaccelerated MRCP enabled a reduction in acquisition time by a factor of 2.4/3.0at 3T/0.55T while maintaining the image quality of conventional acquisitions.</description><author>Jinho Kim, Marcel Dominik Nickel, Florian Knoll</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 15:46:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03732v3</guid></item><item><title>SELMA3D challenge: Self-supervised learning for 3D light-sheet microscopy image segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03880v1</link><description>Recent innovations in light sheet microscopy, paired with developments intissue clearing techniques, enable the 3D imaging of large mammalian tissueswith cellular resolution. Combined with the progress in large-scale dataanalysis, driven by deep learning, these innovations empower researchers torapidly investigate the morphological and functional properties of diversebiological samples.

However, these models exhibit high sensitivity todomain shifts, leading to a significant drop in accuracy when applied to dataoutside their training distribution. To address this limitation, and inspiredby the recent success of self-supervised learning in training generalizablemodels, we organized the SELMA3D Challenge during the MICCAI 2024 conference.SELMA3D provides a vast collection of light-sheet images from cleared mice andhuman brains, comprising 35 large 3D images-each with over 1000^3 voxels-and315 annotated small patches for finetuning, preliminary testing and finaltesting. The dataset encompasses diverse biological structures, includingvessel-like and spot-like structures. Five teams participated in all phases ofthe challenge, and their proposed methods are reviewed in this paper.Quantitative and qualitative results from most participating teams demonstratethat self-supervised learning on large datasets improves segmentation modelperformance and generalization.

In particular,research on 3D Large Multimodal Models (3D LMMs) is making notable strides,driven by the potential of processing higher-dimensional data like pointclouds. However, upon closer examination, we find that the visual and textualcontent within each sample of existing training datasets lacks both highinformational granularity and clarity, which serve as a bottleneck for precisecross-modal understanding. To address these issues, we propose CL3DOR,Contrastive Learning for 3D large multimodal models via Odds ratio onhigh-Resolution point clouds, designed to ensure greater specificity andclarity in both visual and textual content. Specifically, we increase thedensity of point clouds per object and construct informative hard negativeresponses in the training dataset to penalize unwanted responses. To leveragehard negative responses, we incorporate the odds ratio as an auxiliary term forcontrastive learning into the conventional language modeling loss.

Typically, audiorestoration is defined as a task of predicting undistorted audio from damagedinput, often trained using a GAN framework to balance perception anddistortion. Since audio degradation is primarily concentrated in mid- andhigh-frequency ranges, especially due to codecs, a key challenge lies indesigning a generator capable of preserving low-frequency information whileaccurately reconstructing high-quality mid- and high-frequency content.Inspired by recent advancements in high-sample-rate music separation, speechenhancement, and audio codec models, we propose Apollo, a generative modeldesigned for high-sample-rate audio restoration. Apollo employs an explicitfrequency band split module to model the relationships between differentfrequency bands, allowing for more coherent and higher-quality restored audio.Evaluated on the MUSDB18-HQ and MoisesDB datasets, Apollo consistentlyoutperforms existing SR-GAN models across various bit rates and music genres,particularly excelling in complex scenarios involving mixtures of multipleinstruments and vocals. Apollo significantly improves music restoration qualitywhile maintaining computational efficiency.

In contrast, the visual modalityenhances performance in downstream tasks by leveraging rich semantic content,spatial information, and grounding capabilities. These intrinsic modalitieswork synergistically across various visual tasks. Our research initiallyreveals a persistent imbalance between these modalities, with text oftendominating output generation during visual instruction tuning. This imbalanceoccurs when using both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning(PEFT) methods. We then found that re-balancing these modalities cansignificantly reduce the number of trainable parameters required, inspiring adirection for further optimizing visual instruction tuning. We introduceModality Linear Representation-Steering (MoReS) to achieve the goal. MoReSeffectively re-balances the intrinsic modalities throughout the model, wherethe key idea is to steer visual representations through linear transformationsin the visual subspace across each model layer. To validate our solution, wecomposed LLaVA Steering, a suite of models integrated with the proposed MoReSmethod. Evaluation results show that the composed LLaVA Steering modelsrequire, on average, 500 times fewer trainable parameters than LoRA needs whilestill achieving comparable performance across three visual benchmarks and eightvisual question-answering tasks. Last, we present the LLaVA Steering Factory,an in-house developed platform that enables researchers to quickly customizevarious MLLMs with component-based architecture for seamlessly integratingstate-of-the-art models, and evaluate their intrinsic modality imbalance.</description><author>Jinhe Bi, Yujun Wang, Haokun Chen, Xun Xiao, Artur Hecker, Volker Tresp, Yunpu Ma</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 15:36:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12359v2</guid></item><item><title>Add Noise, Tasks, or Layers?

Many approaches for low-resource scenarioshave not yet been applied to dialectal SID data, or compared to each other onthe same datasets. We participate in the VarDial 2025 shared task on slot andintent detection in Norwegian varieties, and compare multiple set-ups: varyingthe training data (English, Norwegian, or dialectal Norwegian), injectingcharacter-level noise, training on auxiliary tasks, and applying LayerSwapping, a technique in which layers of models fine-tuned on differentdatasets are assembled into a model. We find noise injection to be beneficialwhile the effects of auxiliary tasks are mixed. Though some experimentation wasrequired to successfully assemble a model from layers, it worked surprisinglywell; a combination of models trained on English and small amounts of dialectaldata produced the most robust slot predictions.

Developers routinely ask LLMs to generate code snippets, increasingproductivity but also potentially introducing ownership, privacy, correctness,and security issues. Previous work highlighted how code generated by mainstreamcommercial LLMs is often not safe, containing vulnerabilities, bugs, and codesmells. In this paper, we present a framework that leverages testing and staticanalysis to assess the quality, and guide the self-improvement, of codegenerated by general-purpose, open-source LLMs. First, we ask LLMs to generate C code to solve a number of programming tasks.Then we employ ground-truth tests to assess the (in)correctness of thegenerated code, and a static analysis tool to detect potential safetyvulnerabilities. Next, we assess the models ability to evaluate the generatedcode, by asking them to detect errors and vulnerabilities. Finally, we test themodels ability to fix the generated code, providing the reports produced duringthe static analysis and incorrectness evaluation phases as feedback. Our results show that models often produce incorrect code, and that thegenerated code can include safety issues. Moreover, they perform very poorly atdetecting either issue. On the positive side, we observe a substantial abilityto fix flawed code when provided with information about failed tests orpotential vulnerabilities, indicating a promising avenue for improving thesafety of LLM-based code generation tools.</description><author>Greta Dolcetti, Vincenzo Arceri, Eleonora Iotti, Sergio Maffeis, Agostino Cortesi, Enea Zaffanella</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 15:30:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14841v2</guid></item><item><title>Lived Experience Not Found: LLMs Struggle to Align with Experts on Addressing Adverse Drug Reactions from Psychiatric Medication Use</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19155v3</link><description>Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) from psychiatric medications are the leadingcause of hospitalizations among mental health patients.

To address this, we introducethe Psych-ADR benchmark and the Adverse Drug Reaction Response Assessment(ADRA) framework to systematically evaluate LLM performance in detecting ADRexpressions and delivering expert-aligned mitigation strategies. Our analysesshow that LLMs struggle with understanding the nuances of ADRs anddifferentiating between types of ADRs. While LLMs align with experts in termsof expressed emotions and tone of the text, their responses are more complex,harder to read, and only 70.86% aligned with expert strategies. Furthermore,they provide less actionable advice by a margin of 12.32% on average.

A common approach to address this challenge is integratingmodel-based planning algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) orValue Iteration (VI), into the environmental model. However, VI requiresiterating over a large tensor which updates the value of the preceding statebased on the succeeding state through value propagation, resulting incomputationally intensive operations. To enhance the RL training efficiency, wepropose improving the efficiency of the value learning process. Indeterministic environments with discrete state and action spaces, we observethat on the sampled empirical state-transition graph, a non-branching sequenceof transitions-termed a highway-can take the agent to another state withoutdeviation through intermediate states. On these non-branching highways, thevalue-updating process can be streamlined into a single-step operation,eliminating the need for step-by-step updates. Building on this observation, weintroduce the highway graph to model state transitions. The highway graphcompresses the transition model into a compact representation, where edges canencapsulate multiple state transitions, enabling value propagation acrossmultiple time steps in a single iteration. By integrating the highway graphinto RL, the training process is significantly accelerated, particularly in theearly stages of training. Experiments across four categories of environmentsdemonstrate that our method learns significantly faster than established andstate-of-the-art RL algorithms (often by a factor of 10 to 150) whilemaintaining equal or superior expected returns. Furthermore, a deep neuralnetwork-based agent trained using the highway graph exhibits improvedgeneralization capabilities and reduced storage costs.

Forexample, in adaptive clinical trials, where hospitals sequentially recruitvolunteers to test multiple new treatments and adjust plans based onvolunteers' reported profiles such as symptoms and interim data, participantsmay misreport severe side effects like allergy and nausea to avoid perceivedsuboptimal treatments.

We show that traditional low-regret algorithms, such asUCB family algorithms and Thompson sampling, fail to ensure truthful reportingand can result in linear regret in the worst case, while traditional truthfulalgorithms like explore-then-commit (ETC) and $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm incursublinear but high regret. We propose a mechanism that uses a linear program toensure truthfulness while minimizing deviation from Thompson sampling, yieldingan $O(\ln T)$ frequentist regret.

We use the perspective afforded by anaveraging operator to show that for any predictor that is not equivariant,there is an equivariant predictor with strictly lower test risk on allregression problems where the equivariance is correctly specified. Thisconstitutes a rigorous proof that symmetry, in the form of invariance orequivariance, is a useful inductive bias. We apply these ideas to equivariance and invariance in random design leastsquares and kernel ridge regression respectively. This allows us to specify thereduction in expected test risk in more concrete settings and express it interms of properties of the group, the model and the data. Along the way, we give examples and additional results to demonstrate theutility of the averaging operator approach in analysing equivariant predictors.In addition, we adopt an alternative perspective and formalise the commonintuition that learning with invariant models reduces to a problem in terms oforbit representatives. The formalism extends naturally to a similar intuitionfor equivariant models.

Evaluated on two benchmarkroll-based encoders, our method outperforms traditional piano-roll outputs 0.01and 0.022 in onset-offset-velocity F1 score, demonstrating its potential as aperformance-enhancing plug-in for arbitrary roll-based music transcriptionencoder.</description><author>Dichucheng Li, Yongyi Zang, Qiuqiang Kong</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 15:13:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03038v2</guid></item><item><title>Leveraging time and parameters for nonlinear model reduction methods</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03853v1</link><description>In this paper, we consider model order reduction (MOR) methods for problemswith slowly decaying Kolmogorov $n$-widths as, e.g., certain wave-like ortransport-dominated problems. To overcome this Kolmogorov barrier within MOR,nonlinear projections are used, which are often realized numerically usingautoencoders. These autoencoders generally consist of a nonlinear encoder and anonlinear decoder and involve costly training of the hyperparameters to obtaina good approximation quality of the reduced system. To facilitate the trainingprocess, we show that extending the to-be-reduced system and its correspondingtraining data makes it possible to replace the nonlinear encoder with a linearencoder without sacrificing accuracy, thus roughly halving the number ofhyperparameters to be trained.</description><author>Silke Glas, Benjamin Unger</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 15:10:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03853v1</guid></item><item><title>Semise: Semi-supervised learning for severity representation in medical image</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03848v1</link><description>This paper introduces SEMISE, a novel method for representation learning inmedical imaging that combines self-supervised and supervised learning.

However, precise control overthe video generation process, such as camera manipulation or content editing,remains a significant challenge. Existing methods for controlled videogeneration are typically limited to a single control type, lacking theflexibility to handle diverse control demands. In this paper, we introduceDiffusion as Shader (DaS), a novel approach that supports multiple videocontrol tasks within a unified architecture. Our key insight is that achievingversatile video control necessitates leveraging 3D control signals, as videosare fundamentally 2D renderings of dynamic 3D content. Unlike prior methodslimited to 2D control signals, DaS leverages 3D tracking videos as controlinputs, making the video diffusion process inherently 3D-aware. This innovationallows DaS to achieve a wide range of video controls by simply manipulating the3D tracking videos. A further advantage of using 3D tracking videos is theirability to effectively link frames, significantly enhancing the temporalconsistency of the generated videos. With just 3 days of fine-tuning on 8 H800GPUs using less than 10k videos, DaS demonstrates strong control capabilitiesacross diverse tasks, including mesh-to-video generation, camera control,motion transfer, and object manipulation.</description><author>Zekai Gu, Rui Yan, Jiahao Lu, Peng Li, Zhiyang Dou, Chenyang Si, Zhen Dong, Qifeng Liu, Cheng Lin, Ziwei Liu, Wenping Wang, Yuan Liu</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 15:01:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03847v1</guid></item><item><title>GraphLoRA: Structure-Aware Contrastive Low-Rank Adaptation for Cross-Graph Transfer Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16670v2</link><description>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency inhandling a range of graph analytical tasks across various domains, such ase-commerce and social networks. Despite their versatility, GNNs facesignificant challenges in transferability, limiting their utility in real-worldapplications. Existing research in GNN transfer learning overlooksdiscrepancies in distribution among various graph datasets, facing challengeswhen transferring across different distributions. How to effectively adopt awell-trained GNN to new graphs with varying feature and structuraldistributions remains an under-explored problem. Taking inspiration from thesuccess of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in adapting large language models tovarious domains, we propose GraphLoRA, an effective and parameter-efficientmethod for transferring well-trained GNNs to diverse graph domains.Specifically, we first propose a Structure-aware Maximum Mean Discrepancy(SMMD) to align divergent node feature distributions across source and targetgraphs. Moreover, we introduce low-rank adaptation by injecting a smalltrainable GNN alongside the pre-trained one, effectively bridging structuraldistribution gaps while mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, astructure-aware regularization objective is proposed to enhance theadaptability of the pre-trained GNN to target graph with scarce supervisionlabels. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate theeffectiveness of GraphLoRA against fourteen baselines by tuning only 20% ofparameters, even across disparate graph domains.

Our research investigates the relationship between thetraining process and the emergence of hallucinations to address a key gap inexisting research that focuses primarily on post hoc detection and mitigationstrategies. Using models from the Pythia suite (70M - 12B parameters) andseveral hallucination detection metrics, we analyze hallucination trendsthroughout training and explore LLM internal dynamics. We introduce SensitivityDropout (SenD), a novel training protocol designed to mitigate hallucinationsby reducing variance during training. SenD achieves this by deterministicallydropping embedding indices with significant variability, referred to asSensitive Embedding Indices. In addition, we develop an unsupervisedhallucination detection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximatesthe traditional EigenScore at 2x speed. This efficient metric is integratedinto our protocol, allowing SenD to be both computationally scalable andeffective at reducing hallucinations. Our empirical evaluation demonstratesthat our approach improves LLM reliability at test time by up to 40% comparedto normal training while also providing an efficient method to improve factualaccuracy when adapting LLMs to Wikipedia, Medical, and LegalBench domains.</description><author>Shahrad Mohammadzadeh, Juan David Guerra, Marco Bonizzato, Reihaneh Rabbany, Golnoosh Farnadi</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 14:56:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15460v3</guid></item><item><title>BERTopic for Topic Modeling of Hindi Short Texts: A Comparative Study</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03843v1</link><description>As short text data in native languages like Hindi increasingly appear inmodern media, robust methods for topic modeling on such data have gainedimportance.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has gainedrecognition as a potential tool for early CVD risk prediction, though its useremains underexplored. In this study, we investigated the potential of OCT asan additional imaging technique to predict future CVD events. We analysedretinal OCT data from the UK Biobank. The dataset included 612 patients whosuffered a myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke within five years of imagingand 2,234 controls without CVD (total: 2,846 participants). A self-superviseddeep learning approach based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) was used toextract low-dimensional latent representations from high-dimensional 3D OCTimages, capturing distinct features of retinal layers. These latent features,along with clinical data, were used to train a Random Forest (RF) classifier todifferentiate between patients at risk of future CVD events (MI or stroke) andhealthy controls. Our model achieved an AUC of 0.75, sensitivity of 0.70,specificity of 0.70, and accuracy of 0.70, outperforming the QRISK3 score (thethird version of the QRISK cardiovascular disease risk prediction algorithm;AUC = 0.60, sensitivity = 0.60, specificity = 0.55, accuracy = 0.55). Thechoroidal layer in OCT images was identified as a key predictor of future CVDevents, revealed through a novel model explainability approach. This studydemonstrates that retinal OCT imaging is a cost-effective, non-invasivealternative for predicting CVD risk, offering potential for widespreadapplication in optometry practices and hospitals.</description><author>Cynthia Maldonado-Garcia, Rodrigo Bonazzola, Enzo Ferrante, Thomas H Julian, Panagiotis I Sergouniotis, Nishant Ravikumara, Alejandro F Frangi</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 14:52:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18873v2</guid></item><item><title>Machine learning applications in archaeological practices: a review</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03840v1</link><description>Artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in archaeology haveincreased significantly in recent years, and these now span all subfields,geographical regions, and time periods. The prevalence and success of theseapplications have remained largely unexamined, as recent reviews on the use ofmachine learning in archaeology have only focused only on specific subfields ofarchaeology. Our review examined an exhaustive corpus of 135 articles publishedbetween 1997 and 2022. We observed a significant increase in the number ofrelevant publications from 2019 onwards. Automatic structure detection andartefact classification were the most represented tasks in the articlesreviewed, followed by taphonomy, and archaeological predictive modelling. Fromthe review, clustering and unsupervised methods were underrepresented comparedto supervised models. Artificial neural networks and ensemble learning accountfor two thirds of the total number of models used. However, if machine learningis gaining in popularity it remains subject to misunderstanding. We observed,in some cases, poorly defined requirements and caveats of the machine learningmethods used. Furthermore, the goals and the needs of machine learningapplications for archaeological purposes are in some cases unclear or poorlyexpressed. To address this, we proposed a workflow guide for archaeologists todevelop coherent and consistent methodologies adapted to their researchquestions, project scale and data. As in many other areas, machine learning israpidly becoming an important tool in archaeological research and practice,useful for the analyses of large and multivariate data, although not withoutlimitations. This review highlights the importance of well-defined andwell-reported structured methodologies and collaborative practices to maximisethe potential of applications of machine learning methods in archaeology.</description><author>Mathias Bellat, Jordy D.

This results inover-segmentation, under-segmentation, and blurred segmentation boundaries. Totackle these challenges, we explore multi-scale feature representations fromdifferent perspectives, proposing a novel, lightweight, and multi-scalearchitecture (LM-Net) that integrates advantages of both Convolutional NeuralNetworks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) to enhance segmentationaccuracy. LM-Net employs a lightweight multi-branch module to capturemulti-scale features at the same level. Furthermore, we introduce two modulesto concurrently capture local detail textures and global semantics withmulti-scale features at different levels: the Local Feature Transformer (LFT)and Global Feature Transformer (GFT). The LFT integrates local windowself-attention to capture local detail textures, while the GFT leverages globalself-attention to capture global contextual semantics. By combining thesemodules, our model achieves complementarity between local and globalrepresentations, alleviating the problem of blurred segmentation boundaries inmedical image segmentation. To evaluate the feasibility of LM-Net, extensiveexperiments have been conducted on three publicly available datasets withdifferent modalities. Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results,surpassing previous methods, while only requiring 4.66G FLOPs and 5.4Mparameters. These state-of-the-art results on three datasets with differentmodalities demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our proposedLM-Net for various medical image segmentation tasks.</description><author>Zhenkun Lu, Chaoyin She, Wei Wang, Qinghua Huang</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 14:47:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03838v1</guid></item><item><title>SCC-YOLO: An Improved Object Detector for Assisting in Brain Tumor Diagnosis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03836v1</link><description>Brain tumors can result in neurological dysfunction, alterations in cognitiveand psychological states, increased intracranial pressure, and the occurrenceof seizures, thereby presenting a substantial risk to human life and health.The You Only Look Once(YOLO) series models have demonstrated superior accuracyin object detection for medical imaging.

To address these limitations, we introduce Taxonomy-Aware ContrastiveLearning Retrieval (TACLR), the first retrieval-based method for PAVI. TACLRformulates PAVI as an information retrieval task by encoding product profilesand candidate values into embeddings and retrieving values based on theirsimilarity to the item embedding. It leverages contrastive training withtaxonomy-aware hard negative sampling and employs adaptive inference withdynamic thresholds. TACLR offers three key advantages: (1) it effectivelyhandles implicit and OOD values while producing normalized outputs; (2) itscales to thousands of categories, tens of thousands of attributes, andmillions of values; and (3) it supports efficient inference for high-loadindustrial scenarios. Extensive experiments on proprietary and public datasetsvalidate the effectiveness and efficiency of TACLR.

But what if overfitting does occur, thoughrestricted to specific sub-regions of the data space? In this work, we proposea novel score that captures the forgetting rate of deep models on validationdata. We posit that this score quantifies local overfitting: a decline inperformance confined to certain regions of the data space. We then showempirically that local overfitting occurs regardless of the presence oftraditional overfitting. Using the framework of deep over-parametrized linearmodels, we offer a certain theoretical characterization of forgotten knowledge,and show that it correlates with knowledge forgotten by real deep models.Finally, we devise a new ensemble method that aims to recover forgottenknowledge, relying solely on the training history of a single network. Whencombined with self-distillation, this method enhances the performance of anytrained model without adding inference costs.
