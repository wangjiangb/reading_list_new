In this study, we present a novelapproach to improve action recognition by exploiting the hierarchicalorganization of actions and by incorporating contextualized textualinformation, including location and prior actions to reflect the sequentialcontext. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel transformer architecturetailored for action recognition that utilizes both visual and textual features.Visual features are obtained from RGB and optical flow data, while textembeddings represent contextual information. Furthermore, we define a jointloss function to simultaneously train the model for both coarse andfine-grained action recognition, thereby exploiting the hierarchical nature ofactions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we extend the ToyotaSmarthome Untrimmed (TSU) dataset to introduce action hierarchies, introducingthe Hierarchical TSU dataset. We also conduct an ablation study to assess theimpact of different methods for integrating contextual and hierarchical data onaction recognition performance. Results show that the proposed approachoutperforms pre-trained SOTA methods when trained with the samehyperparameters. Moreover, they also show a 17.12% improvement in top-1accuracy over the equivalent fine-grained RGB version when using ground-truthcontextual information, and a 5.33% improvement when contextual information isobtained from actual predictions.</description><author>Manuel Benavent-Lledo, David Mulero-Pérez, David Ortiz-Perez, Jose Garcia-Rodriguez, Antonis Argyros</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 17:59:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21275v1</guid></item><item><title>High-level hybridization of heuristics and metaheuristics to solve symmetric TSP: a comparative study</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21274v1</link><description>The Travelling Salesman Problem - TSP is one of the most explored problems inthe scientific literature to solve real problems regarding the economy,transportation, and logistics, to cite a few cases. Adapting TSP to solvedifferent problems has originated several variants of the optimization problemwith more complex objectives and different restrictions. Metaheuristics havebeen used to solve the problem in polynomial time. Several studies have triedhybridising metaheuristics with specialised heuristics to improve the qualityof the solutions. However, we have found no study to evaluate whether thesearching mechanism of a particular metaheuristic is more adequate forexploring hybridization. This paper focuses on the solution of the classicalTSP using high-level hybridisations, experimenting with eight metaheuristicsand heuristics derived from k-OPT, SISR, and segment intersection search,resulting in twenty-four combinations. Some combinations allow more than oneset of searching parameters. Problems with 50 to 280 cities are solved.Parameter tuning of the metaheuristics is not carried out, exploiting thedifferent searching patterns of the eight metaheuristics instead. Thesolutions' quality is compared to those presented in the literature.</description><author>Carlos Alberto da Silva Junior, Roberto Yuji Tanaka, Luiz Carlos Farias da Silva, Angelo Passaro</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 17:59:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21274v1</guid></item><item><title>On Inductive Biases That Enable Generalization of Diffusion Transformers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21273v1</link><description>Recent work studying the generalization of diffusion models with UNet-baseddenoisers reveals inductive biases that can be expressed via geometry-adaptiveharmonic bases. However, in practice, more recent denoising networks are oftenbased on transformers, e.g., the diffusion transformer (DiT). This raises thequestion: do transformer-based denoising networks exhibit inductive biases thatcan also be expressed via geometry-adaptive harmonic bases? To our surprise, wefind that this is not the case. This discrepancy motivates our search for theinductive bias that can lead to good generalization in DiT models.Investigating the pivotal attention modules of a DiT, we find that locality ofattention maps are closely associated with generalization. To verify thisfinding, we modify the generalization of a DiT by restricting its attentionwindows. We inject local attention windows to a DiT and observe an improvementin generalization. Furthermore, we empirically find that both the placement andthe effective attention size of these local attention windows are crucialfactors. Experimental results on the CelebA, ImageNet, and LSUN datasets showthat strengthening the inductive bias of a DiT can improve both generalizationand generation quality when less training data is available.

To investigatethis question, we use arithmetic reasoning as a representative task. Usingcausal analysis, we identify a subset of the model (a circuit) that explainsmost of the model's behavior for basic arithmetic logic and examine itsfunctionality. By zooming in on the level of individual circuit neurons, wediscover a sparse set of important neurons that implement simple heuristics.Each heuristic identifies a numerical input pattern and outputs correspondinganswers. We hypothesize that the combination of these heuristic neurons is themechanism used to produce correct arithmetic answers. To test this, wecategorize each neuron into several heuristic types-such as neurons thatactivate when an operand falls within a certain range-and find that theunordered combination of these heuristic types is the mechanism that explainsmost of the model's accuracy on arithmetic prompts. Finally, we demonstratethat this mechanism appears as the main source of arithmetic accuracy early intraining. Overall, our experimental results across several LLMs show that LLMsperform arithmetic using neither robust algorithms nor memorization; rather,they rely on a "bag of heuristics".</description><author>Yaniv Nikankin, Anja Reusch, Aaron Mueller, Yonatan Belinkov</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 17:59:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21272v1</guid></item><item><title>EoRA: Training-free Compensation for Compressed LLM with Eigenspace Low-Rank Approximation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21271v1</link><description>In this work, we re-formulate the model compression problem into thecustomized compensation problem: Given a compressed model, we aim to introduceresidual low-rank paths to compensate for compression errors under customizedrequirements from users (e.g., tasks, compression ratios), resulting in greaterflexibility in adjusting overall capacity without being constrained by specificcompression formats. However, naively applying SVD to derive residual pathscauses suboptimal utilization of the low-rank representation capacity. Instead,we propose Training-free Eigenspace Low-Rank Approximation (EoRA), a methodthat directly minimizes compression-induced errors without requiringgradient-based training, achieving fast optimization in minutes using a smallamount of calibration data. EoRA projects compression errors into theeigenspace of input activations, leveraging eigenvalues to effectivelyprioritize the reconstruction of high-importance error components. Moreover,EoRA can be seamlessly integrated with fine-tuning and quantization to furtherimprove effectiveness and efficiency. EoRA consistently outperforms previousmethods in compensating errors for compressed LLaMA2/3 models on various tasks,such as language generation, commonsense reasoning, and math reasoning tasks(e.g., 31.31%/12.88% and 9.69% improvements on ARC-Easy/ARC-Challenge andMathQA when compensating LLaMA3-8B that is quantized to 4-bit and pruned to 2:4sparsity). EoRA offers a scalable, training-free solution to compensate forcompression errors, making it a powerful tool to deploy LLMs in variouscapacity and efficiency requirements.</description><author>Shih-Yang Liu, Huck Yang, Chein-Yi Wang, Nai Chit Fung, Hongxu Yin, Charbel Sakr, Saurav Muralidharan, Kwang-Ting Cheng, Jan Kautz, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Pavlo Molchanov, Min-Hung Chen</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 17:59:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21271v1</guid></item><item><title>OmniSep: Unified Omni-Modality Sound Separation with Query-Mixup</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21269v1</link><description>The scaling up has brought tremendous success in the fields of vision andlanguage in recent years. When it comes to audio, however, researchersencounter a major challenge in scaling up the training data, as most naturalaudio contains diverse interfering signals. To address this limitation, weintroduce Omni-modal Sound Separation (OmniSep), a novel framework capable ofisolating clean soundtracks based on omni-modal queries, encompassing bothsingle-modal and multi-modal composed queries. Specifically, we introduce theQuery-Mixup strategy, which blends query features from different modalitiesduring training. This enables OmniSep to optimize multiple modalitiesconcurrently, effectively bringing all modalities under a unified framework forsound separation. We further enhance this flexibility by allowing queries toinfluence sound separation positively or negatively, facilitating the retentionor removal of specific sounds as desired. Finally, OmniSep employs aretrieval-augmented approach known as Query-Aug, which enables open-vocabularysound separation. Experimental evaluations on MUSIC, VGGSOUND-CLEAN+, andMUSIC-CLEAN+ datasets demonstrate effectiveness of OmniSep, achievingstate-of-the-art performance in text-, image-, and audio-queried soundseparation tasks.

In the weighted variant of this problem, each page has its own fetchingcost; a substantial line of work on this problem culminated in an (optimal)$O(\log k)$-competitive randomized algorithm, due to Bansal, Buchbinder andNaor (FOCS'07). Existing work for weighted paging assumes that page weights are known inadvance, which is not always the case in practice. For example, in multi-levelcaching architectures, the expected cost of fetching a memory block is afunction of its probability of being in a mid-level cache rather than the mainmemory. This complex property cannot be predicted in advance; over time,however, one may glean information about page weights through sampling theirfetching cost multiple times. We present the first algorithm for online weighted paging that does not knowpage weights in advance, but rather learns from weight samples. In terms oftechniques, this requires providing (integral) samples to a fractional solver,requiring a delicate interface between this solver and the randomized roundingscheme; we believe that our work can inspire online algorithms to otherproblems that involve cost sampling.</description><author>Orin Levy, Noam Touitou, Aviv Rosenberg</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 17:57:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21266v1</guid></item><item><title>Modular Duality in Deep Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21265v1</link><description>An old idea in optimization theory says that since the gradient is a dualvector it may not be subtracted from the weights without first being mapped tothe primal space where the weights reside. We take this idea seriously in thispaper and construct such a duality map for general neural networks. Our map,which we call modular dualization, forms a unifying theoretical basis fortraining algorithms that are a) fast and b) scalable. Modular dualizationinvolves first assigning operator norms to layers based on the semantics ofeach layer, and then using these layerwise norms to recursively induce aduality map on the weight space of the full neural architecture. We conclude byderiving GPU-friendly algorithms for dualizing Embed, Linear and Conv2D layers-- the latter two methods are based on a new rectangular Newton-Schulziteration that we propose. Our iteration was recently used to set new speedrecords for training NanoGPT. Overall, we hope that our theory of modularduality will yield a next generation of fast and scalable optimizers forgeneral neural architectures.</description><author>Jeremy Bernstein, Laker Newhouse</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 17:57:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21265v1</guid></item><item><title>LARP: Tokenizing Videos with a Learned Autoregressive Generative Prior</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21264v1</link><description>We present LARP, a novel video tokenizer designed to overcome limitations incurrent video tokenization methods for autoregressive (AR) generative models.Unlike traditional patchwise tokenizers that directly encode local visualpatches into discrete tokens, LARP introduces a holistic tokenization schemethat gathers information from the visual content using a set of learnedholistic queries. This design allows LARP to capture more global and semanticrepresentations, rather than being limited to local patch-level information.Furthermore, it offers flexibility by supporting an arbitrary number ofdiscrete tokens, enabling adaptive and efficient tokenization based on thespecific requirements of the task. To align the discrete token space withdownstream AR generation tasks, LARP integrates a lightweight AR transformer asa training-time prior model that predicts the next token on its discrete latentspace. By incorporating the prior model during training, LARP learns a latentspace that is not only optimized for video reconstruction but is alsostructured in a way that is more conducive to autoregressive generation.Moreover, this process defines a sequential order for the discrete tokens,progressively pushing them toward an optimal configuration during training,ensuring smoother and more accurate AR generation at inference time.Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LARP's strong performance, achievingstate-of-the-art FVD on the UCF101 class-conditional video generationbenchmark. LARP enhances the compatibility of AR models with videos and opensup the potential to build unified high-fidelity multimodal large languagemodels (MLLMs).</description><author>Hanyu Wang, Saksham Suri, Yixuan Ren, Hao Chen, Abhinav Shrivastava</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 17:57:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21264v1</guid></item><item><title>Adaptive Transfer Clustering: A Unified Framework</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21263v1</link><description>We propose a general transfer learning framework for clustering given a maindataset and an auxiliary one about the same subjects.

However, the numerous dense matrix-vector operationsinvolved in these large networks pose significant computational challengesduring inference. To address these challenges, we introduce the Block-LevelAdaptive STructured (BLAST) matrix, designed to learn and leverage efficientstructures prevalent in the weight matrices of linear layers within deeplearning models. Compared to existing structured matrices, the BLAST matrixoffers substantial flexibility, as it can represent various types of structuresthat are either learned from data or computed from pre-existing weightmatrices. We demonstrate the efficiency of using the BLAST matrix forcompressing both language and vision tasks, showing that (i) for medium-sizedmodels such as ViT and GPT-2, training with BLAST weights boosts performancewhile reducing complexity by 70\% and 40\%, respectively; and (ii) for largefoundation models such as Llama-7B and DiT-XL, the BLAST matrix achieves a 2xcompression while exhibiting the lowest performance degradation among alltested structured matrices.

Recently, Lipman et al. (2022)introduced a simple and inexpensive method for training CNFs in generativemodeling, termed flow matching (FM). In this paper, we repurpose this methodfor probabilistic inference by incorporating Markovian sampling methods inevaluating the FM objective, and using the learned CNF to improve Monte Carlosampling. Specifically, we propose an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)algorithm, which combines a local Markov transition kernel with a non-local,flow-informed transition kernel, defined using a CNF. This CNF is adaptedon-the-fly using samples from the Markov chain, which are used to specify theprobability path for the FM objective. Our method also includes an adaptivetempering mechanism that allows the discovery of multiple modes in the targetdistribution. Under mild assumptions, we establish convergence of our method toa local optimum of the FM objective. We then benchmark our approach on severalsynthetic and real-world examples, achieving similar performance to otherstate-of-the-art methods, but often at a significantly lower computationalcost.</description><author>Alberto Cabezas, Louis Sharrock, Christopher Nemeth</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 17:55:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14392v2</guid></item><item><title>AutoBench-V: Can Large Vision-Language Models Benchmark Themselves?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21259v1</link><description>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have become essential for advancing theintegration of visual and linguistic information, facilitating a wide range ofcomplex applications and tasks. However, the evaluation of LVLMs presentssignificant challenges as the evaluation benchmark always demands lots of humancost for its construction, and remains static, lacking flexibility onceconstructed. Even though automatic evaluation has been explored in textualmodality, the visual modality remains under-explored. As a result, in thiswork, we address a question: "Can LVLMs serve as a path to automaticbenchmarking?". We introduce AutoBench-V, an automated framework for servingevaluation on demand, i.e., benchmarking LVLMs based on specific aspects ofmodel capability. Upon receiving an evaluation capability, AutoBench-Vleverages text-to-image models to generate relevant image samples and thenutilizes LVLMs to orchestrate visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, completingthe evaluation process efficiently and flexibly. Through an extensiveevaluation of seven popular LVLMs across five demanded user inputs (i.e.,evaluation capabilities), the framework shows effectiveness and reliability. Weobserve the following: (1) Our constructed benchmark accurately reflectsvarying task difficulties; (2) As task difficulty rises, the performance gapbetween models widens; (3) While models exhibit strong performance in abstractlevel understanding, they underperform in details reasoning tasks; and (4)Constructing a dataset with varying levels of difficulties is critical for acomprehensive and exhaustive evaluation. Overall, AutoBench-V not onlysuccessfully utilizes LVLMs for automated benchmarking but also reveals thatLVLMs as judges have significant potential in various domains.</description><author>Han Bao, Yue Huang, Yanbo Wang, Jiayi Ye, Xiangqi Wang, Xiuyin Chen, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Xiangliang Zhang</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 17:55:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21259v1</guid></item><item><title>Quantum computing and persistence in topological data analysis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21258v1</link><description>Topological data analysis (TDA) aims to extract noise-robust features from adata set by examining the number and persistence of holes in its topology.

However, their slow generation process stemming fromiterative denoising steps poses a challenge for real-time applications inresource-constrained robotics setups and dynamically changing environments. Inthis paper, we introduce the One-Step Diffusion Policy (OneDP), a novelapproach that distills knowledge from pre-trained diffusion policies into asingle-step action generator, significantly accelerating response times forrobotic control tasks. We ensure the distilled generator closely aligns withthe original policy distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL)divergence along the diffusion chain, requiring only $2\%$-$10\%$ additionalpre-training cost for convergence. We evaluated OneDP on 6 challengingsimulation tasks as well as 4 self-designed real-world tasks using the Frankarobot. The results demonstrate that OneDP not only achieves state-of-the-artsuccess rates but also delivers an order-of-magnitude improvement in inferencespeed, boosting action prediction frequency from 1.5 Hz to 62 Hz, establishingits potential for dynamic and computationally constrained robotic applications.We share the project page at https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/onedp/.</description><author>Zhendong Wang, Zhaoshuo Li, Ajay Mandlekar, Zhenjia Xu, Jiaojiao Fan, Yashraj Narang, Linxi Fan, Yuke Zhu, Yogesh Balaji, Mingyuan Zhou, Ming-Yu Liu, Yu Zeng</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 17:54:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21257v1</guid></item><item><title>Multi-modal AI for comprehensive breast cancer prognostication</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21256v1</link><description>Treatment selection in breast cancer is guided by molecular subtypes andclinical characteristics. Recurrence risk assessment plays a crucial role inpersonalizing treatment. Current methods, including genomic assays, havelimited accuracy and clinical utility, leading to suboptimal decisions for manypatients. We developed a test for breast cancer patient stratification based ondigital pathology and clinical characteristics using novel AI methods.Specifically, we utilized a vision transformer-based pan-cancer foundationmodel trained with self-supervised learning to extract features from digitizedH&amp;E-stained slides. These features were integrated with clinical data to form amulti-modal AI test predicting cancer recurrence and death. The test wasdeveloped and evaluated using data from a total of 8,161 breast cancer patientsacross 15 cohorts originating from seven countries. Of these, 3,502 patientsfrom five cohorts were used exclusively for evaluation, while the remainingpatients were used for training. Our test accurately predicted our primaryendpoint, disease-free interval, in the five external cohorts (C-index: 0.71[0.68-0.75], HR: 3.63 [3.02-4.37, p&lt;0.01]). In a direct comparison (N=858), theAI test was more accurate than Oncotype DX, the standard-of-care 21-gene assay,with a C-index of 0.67 [0.61-0.74] versus 0.61 [0.49-0.73], respectively.Additionally, the AI test added independent information to Oncotype DX in amultivariate analysis (HR: 3.11 [1.91-5.09, p&lt;0.01)]). The test demonstratedrobust accuracy across all major breast cancer subtypes, including TNBC(C-index: 0.71 [0.62-0.81], HR: 3.81 [2.35-6.17, p=0.02]), where no diagnostictools are currently recommended by clinical guidelines. These results suggestthat our AI test can improve accuracy, extend applicability to a wider range ofpatients, and enhance access to treatment selection tools.</description><author>Jan Witowski, Ken Zeng, Joseph Cappadona, Jailan Elayoubi, Elena Diana Chiru, Nancy Chan, Young-Joon Kang, Frederick Howard, Irina Ostrovnaya, Carlos Fernandez-Granda, Freya Schnabel, Ugur Ozerdem, Kangning Liu, Zoe Steinsnyder, Nitya Thakore, Mohammad Sadic, Frank Yeung, Elisa Liu, Theodore Hill, Benjamin Swett, Danielle Rigau, Andrew Clayburn, Valerie Speirs, Marcus Vetter, Lina Sojak, Simone Muenst Soysal, Daniel Baumhoer, Khalil Choucair, Yu Zong, Lina Daoud, Anas Saad, Waleed Abdulsattar, Rafic Beydoun, Jia-Wern Pan, Haslina Makmur, Soo-Hwang Teo, Linda Ma Pak, Victor Angel, Dovile Zilenaite-Petrulaitiene, Arvydas Laurinavicius, Natalie Klar, Brian D.

Rather than pursuing a firstlanguage learning (L1) paradigm, we approach the challenge from a secondlanguage (L2) learning perspective. In L2 learning, there is a stronger focuson learning explicit linguistic information, such as grammatical notions,definitions of words or different ways of expressing a meaning. This makes L2learning potentially more efficient and concise. We approximate this using datafrom Wiktionary, grammar examples either generated by an LLM or sourced fromgrammar books, and paraphrase data. We find that explicit information aboutword meaning (in our case, Wiktionary) does not boost model performance, whilegrammatical information can give a small improvement. The most impactful dataingredient is sentence paraphrases, with our two best models being trained on1) a mix of paraphrase data and data from the BabyLM pretraining dataset, and2) exclusively paraphrase data.</description><author>Lukas Edman, Lisa Bylinina, Faeze Ghorbanpour, Alexander Fraser</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 17:52:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21254v1</guid></item><item><title>LongReward: Improving Long-context Large Language Models with AI Feedback</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21252v1</link><description>Though significant advancements have been achieved in developing long-contextlarge language models (LLMs), the compromised quality of LLM-synthesized datafor supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often affects the long-context performance ofSFT models and leads to inherent limitations. In principle, reinforcementlearning (RL) with appropriate reward signals can further enhance models'capacities. However, how to obtain reliable rewards in long-context scenariosremains unexplored. To this end, we propose LongReward, a novel method thatutilizes an off-the-shelf LLM to provide rewards for long-context modelresponses from four human-valued dimensions: helpfulness, logicality,faithfulness, and completeness, each with a carefully designed assessmentpipeline. By combining LongReward and offline RL algorithm DPO, we are able toeffectively improve long-context SFT models. Our experiments indicate thatLongReward not only significantly improves models' long-context performance butalso enhances their ability to follow short instructions.

This work addresses the problem of solving multi-component monotonicMDPs with both budget and capacity constraints. The budget constraint limitsthe total number of restorative actions and the capacity constraint limits thenumber of restorative actions that can be performed simultaneously. While priormethods dealt with budget constraints, including capacity constraints in priormethods leads to an exponential increase in computational complexity as thenumber of components in the MDP grows. We propose a two-step planning approachto address this challenge. First, we partition the components of themulti-component MDP into groups, where the number of groups is determined bythe capacity constraint. We achieve this partitioning by solving a Linear SumAssignment Problem (LSAP). Each group is then allocated a fraction of the totalbudget proportional to its size. This partitioning effectively decouples thelarge multi-component MDP into smaller subproblems, which are computationallyfeasible because the capacity constraint is simplified and the budgetconstraint can be addressed using existing methods. Subsequently, we use ameta-trained PPO agent to obtain an approximately optimal policy for eachgroup. To validate our approach, we apply it to the problem of schedulingrepairs for a large group of industrial robots, constrained by a limited numberof repair technicians and a total repair budget. Our results demonstrate thatthe proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in terms of maximizing theaverage uptime of the robot swarm, particularly for large swarm sizes.</description><author>Manav Vora, Ilan Shomorony, Melkior Ornik</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 17:48:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21249v1</guid></item><item><title>Securing Multi-turn Conversational Language Models From Distributed Backdoor Triggers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04151v2</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have acquired the ability to handle longercontext lengths and understand nuances in text, expanding their dialoguecapabilities beyond a single utterance. A popular user-facing application ofLLMs is the multi-turn chat setting. Though longer chat memory and betterunderstanding may seemingly benefit users, our paper exposes a vulnerabilitythat leverages the multi-turn feature and strong learning ability of LLMs toharm the end-user: the backdoor. We demonstrate that LLMs can capture thecombinational backdoor representation. Only upon presentation of triggerstogether does the backdoor activate. We also verify empirically that thisrepresentation is invariant to the position of the trigger utterance.Subsequently, inserting a single extra token into two utterances of 5%of thedata can cause over 99% Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results with 3 triggersdemonstrate that this framework is generalizable, compatible with any triggerin an adversary's toolbox in a plug-and-play manner. Defending the backdoor canbe challenging in the chat setting because of the large input and output space.Our analysis indicates that the distributed backdoor exacerbates the currentchallenges by polynomially increasing the dimension of the attacked inputspace. Canonical textual defenses like ONION and BKI leverage auxiliary modelforward passes over individual tokens, scaling exponentially with the inputsequence length and struggling to maintain computational feasibility. To thisend, we propose a decoding time defense - decayed contrastive decoding - thatscales linearly with assistant response sequence length and reduces thebackdoor to as low as 0.35%.</description><author>Terry Tong, Jiashu Xu, Qin Liu, Muhao Chen</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 17:48:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04151v2</guid></item><item><title>Bayesian-LoRA: LoRA based Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning using Optimal Quantization levels and Rank Values trough Differentiable Bayesian Gates</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13046v3</link><description>It is a common practice in natural language processing to pre-train a singlemodel on a general domain and then fine-tune it for downstream tasks. However,when it comes to Large Language Models, fine-tuning the entire model can becomputationally expensive, resulting in very intensive energy consumption. As aresult, several Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approaches were recentlyproposed. One of the most popular approaches is low-rank adaptation (LoRA),where the key insight is decomposing the update weights of the pre-trainedmodel into two low-rank matrices. However, the proposed approaches either usethe same rank value across all different weight matrices, which has been shownto be a sub-optimal choice, or do not use any quantization technique, one ofthe most important factors when it comes to a model's energy consumption. Inthis work, we propose Bayesian-LoRA which approaches low-rank adaptation andquantization from a Bayesian perspective by employing a prior distribution onboth quantization levels and rank values. As a result, B-LoRA is able tofine-tune a pre-trained model on a specific downstream task, finding theoptimal rank values and quantization levels for every low-rank matrix. Wevalidate the proposed model by fine-tuning a pre-trained DeBERTaV3 on the GLUEbenchmark. Moreover, we compare it to relevant baselines and present bothqualitative and quantitative results, showing how the proposed approach is ableto learn optimal-rank quantized matrices. B-LoRA performs on par with or betterthan the baselines while reducing the total number of bit operations by roughly70% compared to the baseline methods.</description><author>Cristian Meo, Ksenia Sycheva, Anirudh Goyal, Justin Dauwels</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 17:47:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13046v3</guid></item><item><title>Large-scale cloze evaluation reveals that token prediction tasks are neither lexically nor semantically aligned</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12057v2</link><description>In this work we compare the generative behavior at the next token predictionlevel in several language models by comparing them to human productions in thecloze task.

Recent work has looked to overcome this challengeby using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate hypothetical documents thatcan be used to find the closest real document. However, this approach reliessolely on the LLM to have domain-specific knowledge relevant to the query,which may not be practical. Furthermore, generating hypothetical documents canbe inefficient as it requires the LLM to generate a large number of tokens foreach query. To address these challenges, we introduce Real Document Embeddingsfrom Relevance Feedback (ReDE-RF). Inspired by relevance feedback, ReDE-RFproposes to re-frame hypothetical document generation as a relevance estimationtask, using an LLM to select which documents should be used for nearestneighbor search. Through this re-framing, the LLM no longer needsdomain-specific knowledge but only needs to judge what is relevant.Additionally, relevance estimation only requires the LLM to output a singletoken, thereby improving search latency. Our experiments show that ReDE-RFconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot dense retrieval methodsacross a wide range of low-resource retrieval datasets while also makingsignificant improvements in latency per-query.</description><author>Nour Jedidi, Yung-Sung Chuang, Leslie Shing, James Glass</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 17:40:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21242v1</guid></item><item><title>Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Construction from Images for Scalable E-Commerce</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21237v1</link><description>Knowledge Graph (KG) is playing an increasingly important role in various AIsystems.

This paperintroduces RepairAgent, the first work to address the program repair challengethrough an autonomous agent based on a large language model (LLM). Unlikeexisting deep learning-based approaches, which prompt a model with a fixedprompt or in a fixed feedback loop, our work treats the LLM as an agent capableof autonomously planning and executing actions to fix bugs by invoking suitabletools. RepairAgent freely interleaves gathering information about the bug,gathering repair ingredients, and validating fixes, while deciding which toolsto invoke based on the gathered information and feedback from previous fixattempts. Key contributions that enable RepairAgent include a set of tools thatare useful for program repair, a dynamically updated prompt format that allowsthe LLM to interact with these tools, and a finite state machine that guidesthe agent in invoking the tools. Our evaluation on the popular Defects4Jdataset demonstrates RepairAgent's effectiveness in autonomously repairing 164bugs, including 39 bugs not fixed by prior techniques. Interacting with the LLMimposes an average cost of 270,000 tokens per bug, which, under the currentpricing of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, translates to 14 cents of USD per bug.

One promising wayof leveraging LLM judges for supervision is through Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR)decoding, which uses a reference-based evaluator to select a high-qualityoutput from amongst a set of candidate outputs. In the first part of this work,we explore using MBR decoding as a method for improving the test-timeperformance of instruction-following LLMs. We find that MBR decoding withreference-based LLM judges substantially improves over greedy decoding,best-of-N decoding with reference-free judges and MBR decoding with lexical andembedding-based metrics on AlpacaEval and MT-Bench. These gains are consistentacross LLMs with up to 70B parameters, demonstrating that smaller LLM judgescan be used to supervise much larger LLMs. Then, seeking to retain theimprovements from MBR decoding while mitigating additional test-time costs, weexplore iterative self-training on MBR-decoded outputs.

Recently, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)have been shown to match the performance of fully fine-tuned models on varioustasks with an extreme reduction in the number of trainable parameters. Even insettings where both methods learn similarly accurate models, \emph{are theirlearned solutions really equivalent?} We study how different fine-tuningmethods change pre-trained models by analyzing the model's weight matricesthrough the lens of their spectral properties. We find that full fine-tuningand LoRA yield weight matrices whose singular value decompositions exhibit verydifferent structure; moreover, the fine-tuned models themselves show distinctgeneralization behaviors when tested outside the adaptation task'sdistribution. More specifically, we first show that the weight matrices trainedwith LoRA have new, high-ranking singular vectors, which we call \emph{intruderdimensions}. Intruder dimensions do not appear during full fine-tuning. Second,we show that LoRA models with intruder dimensions, despite achieving similarperformance to full fine-tuning on the target task, become worse models of thepre-training distribution and adapt less robustly to multiple taskssequentially. Higher-rank, rank-stabilized LoRA models closely mirror fullfine-tuning, even when performing on par with lower-rank LoRA models on thesame tasks. These results suggest that models updated with LoRA and fullfine-tuning access different parts of parameter space, even when they performequally on the fine-tuned distribution. We conclude by examining why intruderdimensions appear in LoRA fine-tuned models, why they are undesirable, and howtheir effects can be minimized.</description><author>Reece Shuttleworth, Jacob Andreas, Antonio Torralba, Pratyusha Sharma</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 17:14:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21228v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning to Walk from Three Minutes of Real-World Data with Semi-structured Dynamics Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09163v2</link><description>Traditionally, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) methods exploitneural networks as flexible function approximators to represent $\textit{apriori}$ unknown environment dynamics. However, training data are typicallyscarce in practice, and these black-box models often fail to generalize.Modeling architectures that leverage known physics can substantially reduce thecomplexity of system-identification, but break down in the face of complexphenomena such as contact. We introduce a novel framework for learningsemi-structured dynamics models for contact-rich systems which seamlesslyintegrates structured first principles modeling techniques with black-boxauto-regressive models. Specifically, we develop an ensemble of probabilisticmodels to estimate external forces, conditioned on historical observations andactions, and integrate these predictions using known Lagrangian dynamics. Withthis semi-structured approach, we can make accurate long-horizon predictionswith substantially less data than prior methods.

In this paper, we studythe sharpness of deep linear networks for univariate regression. Minimizers canhave arbitrarily large sharpness, but not an arbitrarily small one. Indeed, weshow a lower bound on the sharpness of minimizers, which grows linearly withdepth. We then study the properties of the minimizer found by gradient flow,which is the limit of gradient descent with vanishing learning rate. We show animplicit regularization towards flat minima: the sharpness of the minimizer isno more than a constant times the lower bound. The constant depends on thecondition number of the data covariance matrix, but not on width or depth. Thisresult is proven both for a small-scale initialization and a residualinitialization. Results of independent interest are shown in both cases. Forsmall-scale initialization, we show that the learned weight matrices areapproximately rank-one and that their singular vectors align.

Despitegrowing interest and initial studies in automating penetration testing withgenerative agents, there remains a significant gap in the form of acomprehensive and standard framework for their evaluation and development. Thispaper introduces AutoPenBench, an open benchmark for evaluating generativeagents in automated penetration testing. We present a comprehensive frameworkthat includes 33 tasks, each representing a vulnerable system that the agenthas to attack. Tasks are of increasing difficulty levels, including in-vitroand real-world scenarios. We assess the agent performance with generic andspecific milestones that allow us to compare results in a standardised mannerand understand the limits of the agent under test. We show the benefits ofAutoPenBench by testing two agent architectures: a fully autonomous and asemi-autonomous supporting human interaction. We compare their performance andlimitations. For example, the fully autonomous agent performs unsatisfactorilyachieving a 21% Success Rate (SR) across the benchmark, solving 27% of thesimple tasks and only one real-world task. In contrast, the assisted agentdemonstrates substantial improvements, with 64% of SR. AutoPenBench allows usalso to observe how different LLMs like GPT-4o or OpenAI o1 impact the abilityof the agents to complete the tasks. We believe that our benchmark fills thegap with a standard and flexible framework to compare penetration testingagents on a common ground.

This problem defies any known traditional methods ofnonlinear time-series analysis as well as existing machine-learning methodsthat typically require extensive data from the target system for training. Weaddress this challenge by developing a hybrid transformer andreservoir-computing machine-learning scheme. The key idea is that, for acomplex and nonlinear target system, the training of the transformer can beconducted not using any data from the target system, but with essentiallyunlimited synthetic data from known chaotic systems. The trained transformer isthen tested with the sparse data from the target system. The output of thetransformer is further fed into a reservoir computer for predicting thelong-term dynamics or the attractor of the target system. The power of theproposed hybrid machine-learning framework is demonstrated using a large numberof prototypical nonlinear dynamical systems, with high reconstruction accuracyeven when the available data is only 20% of that required to faithfullyrepresent the dynamical behavior of the underlying system. The frameworkprovides a paradigm of reconstructing complex and nonlinear dynamics in theextreme situation where training data does not exist and the observations arerandom and sparse.</description><author>Zheng-Meng Zhai, Jun-Yin Huang, Benjamin D.

This challenge is particularly pronounced for largevision-language models (VLMs): if the model has not been exposed to the objectdepicted in an image, it struggles to generate reliable answers to the user'squestion regarding that image. Moreover, as new objects and events continuouslyemerge, frequently updating VLMs is impractical due to heavy computationalburdens. To address this limitation, we propose Vision Search Assistant, anovel framework that facilitates collaboration between VLMs and web agents.This approach leverages VLMs' visual understanding capabilities and web agents'real-time information access to perform open-world Retrieval-AugmentedGeneration via the web.

Unlike existingmethods that learn to mimic a single concept from a collection of images, ourmethod captures the stylistic difference between paired images. This allows usto apply a stylistic change without overfitting to the specific image contentin the examples. To address this new task, we employ a joint optimizationmethod that explicitly separates the style and content into distinct LoRAweight spaces. We optimize these style and content weights to reproduce thestyle and content images while encouraging their orthogonality.

We argue thatlong-term decay is outdated in the era of LLMs, as LLMs are now applied totasks demanding precise retrieval of in-context information from arbitrarypositions. Firstly, we present empirical analyses on various PEs, demonstratingthat models inherently learn attention with only a local-decay pattern whileforming a U-shape pattern globally, contradicting the principle of long-termdecay. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of rotary position encoding(RoPE, a prevalent relative positional encoding in LLMs), and found that theU-shape attention is caused by some learned components, which are also the keyfactor limiting RoPE's expressiveness and extrapolation.Inspired by theseinsights, we propose High-frequency rotary Position Encoding (HoPE). HoPEreplaces the specific components in RoPE with position-independent ones,retaining only high-frequency signals, which also breaks the principle oflong-term decay in theory. HoPE achieves two major advantages: (1) Withoutconstraints imposed by long-term decay, contradictory factors that limitspontaneous attention optimization and model extrapolation performance areremoved.

In thispaper, we present a systematic study on fine-grained readability measurementsin the medical domain at both sentence-level and span-level. We introduce a newdataset MedReadMe, which consists of manually annotated readability ratings andfine-grained complex span annotation for 4,520 sentences, featuring two novel"Google-Easy" and "Google-Hard" categories. It supports our quantitativeanalysis, which covers 650 linguistic features and automatic complex word andjargon identification. Enabled by our high-quality annotation, we benchmark andimprove several state-of-the-art sentence-level readability metrics for themedical domain specifically, which include unsupervised, supervised, andprompting-based methods using recently developed large language models (LLMs).Informed by our fine-grained complex span annotation, we find that adding asingle feature, capturing the number of jargon spans, into existing readabilityformulas can significantly improve their correlation with human judgments.

We derive explicit expressions forthe moment- and cumulant-generating functionals, in terms of the distributionof the initial data and properties of forward process. It is shown analyticallythat during the forward process higher-order cumulants are conserved in modelswithout a drift, such as the variance-expanding scheme, and that therefore theendpoint of the forward process maintains nontrivial correlations. Wedemonstrate that since these correlations are encoded in the score function,higher-order cumulants are learnt in the backward process, also when startingfrom a normal prior. We confirm our analytical results in an exactly solvabletoy model with nonzero cumulants and in scalar lattice field theory.</description><author>Gert Aarts, Diaa E.

Recently,Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative, offering efficient long-rangecontextual modeling capabilities without the quadratic complexity associatedwith Transformer's attention mechanisms. However, despite Mamba's potential,early efforts have all failed to achieve better performance than the bestCNN-based and Transformer-based methods. In this work, we address thischallenge by identifying the key components of an effective and efficient pointcloud segmentation architecture. Specifically, we show that: 1) Spatiallocality and robust contextual understanding are critical for strongperformance, and 2) Mamba features linear computational complexity, offeringsuperior data and inference efficiency compared to Transformers, while stillbeing capable of delivering strong contextual understanding. Additionally, wefurther enhance the standard Mamba specifically for point cloud segmentation byidentifying its two key shortcomings. First, the enforced causality in theoriginal Mamba is unsuitable for processing point clouds that have no suchdependencies. Second, its unidirectional scanning strategy imposes adirectional bias, hampering its ability to capture the full context ofunordered point clouds in a single pass. To address these issues, we carefullyremove the causal convolutions and introduce a novel Strided Bidirectional SSMto enhance the model's capability to capture spatial relationships. Our effortsculminate in the development of a novel architecture named MEEPO, whicheffectively integrates the strengths of CNN and Mamba. MEEPO surpasses theprevious state-of-the-art method, PTv3, by up to +0.8 mIoU on multiple keybenchmark datasets, while being 42.1% faster and 5.53x more memory efficient.</description><author>Yong Xien Chng, Xuchong Qiu, Yizeng Han, Yifan Pu, Jiewei Cao, Gao Huang</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 16:56:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21211v1</guid></item><item><title>SeriesGAN: Time Series Generation via Adversarial and Autoregressive Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21203v1</link><description>Current Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approaches for time seriesgeneration face challenges such as suboptimal convergence, information loss inembedding spaces, and instability. To overcome these challenges, we introducean advanced framework that integrates the advantages of anautoencoder-generated embedding space with the adversarial training dynamics ofGANs. This method employs two discriminators: one to specifically guide thegenerator and another to refine both the autoencoder's and generator's output.Additionally, our framework incorporates a novel autoencoder-based lossfunction and supervision from a teacher-forcing supervisor network, whichcaptures the stepwise conditional distributions of the data. The generatoroperates within the latent space, while the two discriminators work on latentand feature spaces separately, providing crucial feedback to both the generatorand the autoencoder. By leveraging this dual-discriminator approach, weminimize information loss in the embedding space.

Inthis paper, we identify surprising and nuanced behavior of finetuned models onworst-group accuracy via comprehensive experiments on four well-establishedbenchmarks across vision and language tasks. We first show that the commonlyused class-balancing techniques of mini-batch upsampling and loss upweightingcan induce a decrease in worst-group accuracy (WGA) with training epochs,leading to performance no better than without class-balancing. While in somescenarios, removing data to create a class-balanced subset is more effective,we show this depends on group structure and propose a mixture method which canoutperform both techniques. Next, we show that scaling pretrained models isgenerally beneficial for worst-group accuracy, but only in conjunction withappropriate class-balancing. Finally, we identify spectral imbalance infinetuning features as a potential source of group disparities -- minoritygroup covariance matrices incur a larger spectral norm than majority groupsonce conditioned on the classes. Our results show more nuanced interactions ofmodern finetuned models with group robustness than was previously known.

In this work, we investigate this central researchquestion: Can LLMs automatically discover novel and valid chemistry researchhypotheses given only a chemistry research background (consisting of a researchquestion and/or a background survey), without limitation on the domain of theresearch question? After extensive discussions with chemistry experts, wepropose an assumption that a majority of chemistry hypotheses can be resultedfrom a research background and several inspirations. With this key insight, webreak the central question into three smaller fundamental questions. In brief,they are: (1) given a background question, whether LLMs can retrieve goodinspirations; (2) with background and inspirations, whether LLMs can lead tohypothesis; and (3) whether LLMs can identify good hypotheses to rank themhigher. To investigate these questions, we construct a benchmark consisting of51 chemistry papers published in Nature, Science, or a similar level in 2024(all papers are only available online since 2024). Every paper is divided bychemistry PhD students into three components: background, inspirations, andhypothesis. The goal is to rediscover the hypothesis, given only the backgroundand a large randomly selected chemistry literature corpus consisting the groundtruth inspiration papers, with LLMs trained with data up to 2023. We alsodevelop an LLM-based multi-agent framework that leverages the assumption,consisting of three stages reflecting the three smaller questions.

Failure to grasp these distinctionscan lead to significant consequences in areas such as medical diagnosis, legaljudgments, and dissemination of fake news. Despite this, current literature haslargely focused on more complex issues such as theory of mind, overlooking morefundamental epistemic challenges. This study systematically evaluates theepistemic reasoning capabilities of modern LMs, including GPT-4, Claude-3, andLlama-3, using a new dataset, KaBLE, consisting of 13,000 questions across 13tasks. Our results reveal key limitations. First, while LMs achieve 86%accuracy on factual scenarios, their performance drops significantly with falsescenarios, particularly in belief-related tasks. Second, LMs struggle withrecognizing and affirming personal beliefs, especially when those beliefscontradict factual data, which raises concerns for applications in healthcareand counseling, where engaging with a person's beliefs is critical. Third, weidentify a salient bias in how LMs process first-person versus third-personbeliefs, performing better on third-person tasks (80.7%) compared tofirst-person tasks (54.4%). Fourth, LMs lack a robust understanding of thefactive nature of knowledge, namely, that knowledge inherently requires truth.Fifth, LMs rely on linguistic cues for fact-checking and sometimes bypass thedeeper reasoning. These findings highlight significant concerns about currentLMs' ability to reason about truth, belief, and knowledge while emphasizing theneed for advancements in these areas before broad deployment in criticalsectors.</description><author>Mirac Suzgun, Tayfun Gur, Federico Bianchi, Daniel E.

While safetymeasures like preventing jailbreaks and improving safety guardrails areimportant, such measures can easily be reversed through fine-tuning. In thiswork, we propose Representation Noising (RepNoise), a defence mechanism that iseffective even when attackers have access to the weights. RepNoise works byremoving information about harmful representations such that it is difficult torecover them during fine-tuning. Importantly, our defence is also able togeneralize across different subsets of harm that have not been seen during thedefence process as long as they are drawn from the same distribution of theattack set. Our method does not degrade the general capability of LLMs andretains the ability to train the model on harmless tasks.

It builds an expanding body of knowledgeand skills by combining individual exploration with inter-generationalinformation transmission. Despite its widespread success among humans, thecapacity for artificial learning agents to accumulate culture remainsunder-explored. In particular, approaches to reinforcement learning typicallystrive for improvements over only a single lifetime. Generational algorithmsthat do exist fail to capture the open-ended, emergent nature of culturalaccumulation, which allows individuals to trade-off innovation and imitation.Building on the previously demonstrated ability for reinforcement learningagents to perform social learning, we find that training setups which balancethis with independent learning give rise to cultural accumulation. Theseaccumulating agents outperform those trained for a single lifetime with thesame cumulative experience. We explore this accumulation by constructing twomodels under two distinct notions of a generation: episodic generations, inwhich accumulation occurs via in-context learning and train-time generations,in which accumulation occurs via in-weights learning. In-context and in-weightscultural accumulation can be interpreted as analogous to knowledge and skillaccumulation, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work is thefirst to present general models that achieve emergent cultural accumulation inreinforcement learning, opening up new avenues towards more open-ended learningsystems, as well as presenting new opportunities for modelling human culture.</description><author>Jonathan Cook, Chris Lu, Edward Hughes, Joel Z.

It seems natural, then, to raise thebid: Are LLMs ready to compete in creative writing skills with a top (ratherthan average) novelist? To provide an initial answer for this question, we havecarried out a contest between Patricio Pron (an awarded novelist, consideredone of the best of his generation) and GPT-4 (one of the top performing LLMs),in the spirit of AI-human duels such as DeepBlue vs Kasparov and AlphaGo vs LeeSidol. We asked Pron and GPT-4 to provide thirty titles each, and then to writeshort stories for both their titles and their opponent's. Then, we prepared anevaluation rubric inspired by Boden's definition of creativity, and wecollected 5,400 manual assessments provided by literature critics and scholars.The results of our experimentation indicate that LLMs are still far fromchallenging a top human creative writer, and that reaching such level ofautonomous creative writing skills probably cannot be reached simply withlarger language models.</description><author>Guillermo Marco, Julio Gonzalo, Ramón del Castillo, María Teresa Mateo Girona</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 16:32:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01119v2</guid></item><item><title>Aligning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Reward Backpropagation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03739v3</link><description>Text-to-image diffusion models have recently emerged at the forefront ofimage generation, powered by very large-scale unsupervised or weakly supervisedtext-to-image training datasets. Due to their unsupervised training,controlling their behavior in downstream tasks, such as maximizinghuman-perceived image quality, image-text alignment, or ethical imagegeneration, is difficult. Recent works finetune diffusion models to downstreamreward functions using vanilla reinforcement learning, notorious for the highvariance of the gradient estimators. In this paper, we propose AlignProp, amethod that aligns diffusion models to downstream reward functions usingend-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient through the denoisingprocess. While naive implementation of such backpropagation would requireprohibitive memory resources for storing the partial derivatives of moderntext-to-image models, AlignProp finetunes low-rank adapter weight modules anduses gradient checkpointing, to render its memory usage viable. We testAlignProp in finetuning diffusion models to various objectives, such asimage-text semantic alignment, aesthetics, compressibility and controllabilityof the number of objects present, as well as their combinations. We showAlignProp achieves higher rewards in fewer training steps than alternatives,while being conceptually simpler, making it a straightforward choice foroptimizing diffusion models for differentiable reward functions of interest.Code and Visualization results are available at https://align-prop.github.io/.</description><author>Mihir Prabhudesai, Anirudh Goyal, Deepak Pathak, Katerina Fragkiadaki</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 16:25:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03739v3</guid></item><item><title>Immunohistochemistry guided segmentation of benign epithelial cells, in situ lesions, and invasive epithelial cells in breast cancer slides</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13261v4</link><description>Digital pathology enables automatic analysis of histopathological sectionsusing artificial intelligence (AI). Automatic evaluation could improvediagnostic efficiency and help find associations between morphological featuresand clinical outcome. For development of such prediction models, identifyinginvasive epithelial cells, and separating these from benign epithelial cellsand in situ lesions would be the first step. In this study, we aimed to developan AI model for segmentation of epithelial cells in sections from breastcancer. We generated epithelial ground truth masks by restaining hematoxylinand eosin (HE) sections with cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, and by pathologists'annotations. HE/CK image pairs were used to train a convolutional neuralnetwork, and data augmentation was used to make the model more robust. Tissuemicroarrays (TMAs) from 839 patients, and whole slide images from two patientswere used for training and evaluation of the models. The sections were derivedfrom four cohorts of breast cancer patients. TMAs from 21 patients from a fifthcohort was used as a second test set. In quantitative evaluation, a mean Dicescore of 0.70, 0.79, and 0.75 for invasive epithelial cells, benign epithelialcells, and in situ lesions, respectively, were achieved. In qualitative scoring(0-5) by pathologists, results were best for all epithelium and invasiveepithelium, with scores of 4.7 and 4.4. Scores for benign epithelium and insitu lesions were 3.7 and 2.0.

Our theory offers a unified and rigorous explanation of machinelearning bias, providing insights into phenomena such as bias amplification andminority-group bias in various feature and parameter regimes. For example, wedemonstrate that there may be an optimal regularization penalty or trainingtime to avoid bias amplification, and there can be fundamental differences intest error between groups that do not vanish with increased parameterization.Importantly, our theoretical predictions align with several empiricalobservations reported in the literature.

This study is conducted to propose a frameworkof automatic crack segmentation from high-resolution images containing crackinformation about steel box girders of bridges. Considering the multi-scalefeature of cracks, convolutional neural network architecture of Feature PyramidNetworks (FPN) for crack detection is proposed. As for input, 120 raw imagesare processed via two approaches (shrinking the size of images and splittingimages into sub-images). Then, models with the proposed structure of FPN forcrack detection are developed. The result shows all developed models canautomatically detect the cracks at the raw images. By shrinking the images, thecomputation efficiency is improved without decreasing accuracy. Because of theseparable characteristic of crack, models using the splitting method providemore accurate crack segmentations than models using the resizing method.Therefore, for high-resolution images, the FPN structure coupled with thesplitting method is an promising solution for the crack segmentation anddetection.</description><author>Jiawei Zhang, Jun Li, Reachsak Ly, Yunyi Liu, Jiangpeng Shu</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 16:16:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21175v1</guid></item><item><title>Joint Audio-Visual Idling Vehicle Detection with Streamlined Input Dependencies</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21170v1</link><description>Idling vehicle detection (IVD) can be helpful in monitoring and reducingunnecessary idling and can be integrated into real-time systems to address theresulting pollution and harmful products. The previous approach [13], anon-end-to-end model, requires extra user clicks to specify a part of theinput, making system deployment more error-prone or even not feasible. Incontrast, we introduce an end-to-end joint audio-visual IVD task designed todetect vehicles visually under three states: moving, idling and engine off.Unlike feature co-occurrence task such as audio-visual vehicle tracking, ourIVD task addresses complementary features, where labels cannot be determined bya single modality alone. To this end, we propose AVIVD-Net, a novel networkthat integrates audio and visual features through a bidirectional attentionmechanism. AVIVD-Net streamlines the input process by learning a joint featurespace, reducing the deployment complexity of previous methods. Additionally, weintroduce the AVIVD dataset, which is seven times larger than previousdatasets, offering significantly more annotated samples to study the IVDproblem. Our model achieves performance comparable to prior approaches, makingit suitable for automated deployment. Furthermore, by evaluating AVIVDNet onthe feature co-occurrence public dataset MAVD [23], we demonstrate itspotential for extension to self-driving vehicle video-camera setups.</description><author>Xiwen Li, Rehman Mohammed, Tristalee Mangin, Surojit Saha, Ross T Whitaker, Kerry E.

Motivated by applications tolist-decodable learning and clustering, recent works have considered theproblem of constructing efficient certificates of anti-concentration in theaverage case, when the set of points $X$ corresponds to samples from a Gaussiandistribution. Their certificates played a crucial role in several subsequentworks in algorithmic robust statistics on list-decodable learning and settlingthe robust learnability of arbitrary Gaussian mixtures, yet remain limited torotationally invariant distributions. This work presents a new (and arguably the most natural) formulation foranti-concentration. Using this formulation, we give quasi-polynomial timeverifiable sum-of-squares certificates of anti-concentration that hold for awide class of non-Gaussian distributions including anti-concentrated boundedproduct distributions and uniform distributions over $L_p$ balls (and theiraffine transformations). Consequently, our method upgrades and extends resultsin algorithmic robust statistics e.g., list-decodable learning and clustering,to such distributions. Our approach constructs a canonical integer program foranti-concentration and analysis a sum-of-squares relaxation of it, independentof the intended application. We rely on duality and analyze apseudo-expectation on large subsets of the input points that take a small valuein some direction. Our analysis uses the method of polynomial reweightings toreduce the problem to analyzing only analytically dense or sparse directions.</description><author>Ainesh Bakshi, Pravesh Kothari, Goutham Rajendran, Madhur Tulsiani, Aravindan Vijayaraghavan</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 16:13:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15084v2</guid></item><item><title>Document Parsing Unveiled: Techniques, Challenges, and Prospects for Structured Information Extraction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21169v1</link><description>Document parsing is essential for converting unstructured and semi-structureddocuments-such as contracts, academic papers, and invoices-into structured,machine-readable data.

A common strategy in modern databases to acceleratepredicate queries is the use of indexes, which map attribute values (keys) totheir corresponding positions in a sorted data array. This allows for fastlookup and retrieval of data subsets that satisfy specific predicates.Unfortunately, indexes cannot be directly applied to encrypted databases due tostrong data dependent leakages. Recent approaches apply differential privacy(DP) to construct noisy indexes that enable faster access to encrypted datawhile maintaining provable privacy guarantees. However, these methods oftensuffer from large storage costs, with index sizes typically scaling linearlywith the key space. To address this challenge, we propose leveraging learnedindexes, a trending technique that repurposes machine learning models asindexing structures, to build more compact DP indexes.</description><author>Jianzhang Du, Tilak Mudgal, Rutvi Rahul Gadre, Yukui Luo, Chenghong Wang</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 16:04:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21164v1</guid></item><item><title>Resilience in Knowledge Graph Embeddings</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21163v1</link><description>In recent years, knowledge graphs have gained interest and witnessedwidespread applications in various domains, such as information retrieval,question-answering, recommendation systems, amongst others. Large-scaleknowledge graphs to this end have demonstrated their utility in effectivelyrepresenting structured knowledge. To further facilitate the application ofmachine learning techniques, knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models have beendeveloped. Such models can transform entities and relationships withinknowledge graphs into vectors. However, these embedding models often facechallenges related to noise, missing information, distribution shift,adversarial attacks, etc. This can lead to sub-optimal embeddings and incorrectinferences, thereby negatively impacting downstream applications. While theexisting literature has focused so far on adversarial attacks on KGE models,the challenges related to the other critical aspects remain unexplored. In thispaper, we, first of all, give a unified definition of resilience, encompassingseveral factors such as generalisation, performance consistency, distributionadaption, and robustness. After formalizing these concepts for machine learningin general, we define them in the context of knowledge graphs. To find the gapin the existing works on resilience in the context of knowledge graphs, weperform a systematic survey, taking into account all these aspects mentionedpreviously. Our survey results show that most of the existing works focus on aspecific aspect of resilience, namely robustness. After categorizing such worksbased on their respective aspects of resilience, we discuss the challenges andfuture research directions.</description><author>Arnab Sharma, N'Dah Jean Kouagou, Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 16:04:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21163v1</guid></item><item><title>End-To-End Causal Effect Estimation from Unstructured Natural Language Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07018v3</link><description>Knowing the effect of an intervention is critical for human decision-making,but current approaches for causal effect estimation rely on manual datacollection and structuring, regardless of the causal assumptions. Thisincreases both the cost and time-to-completion for studies. We show how large,diverse observational text data can be mined with large language models (LLMs)to produce inexpensive causal effect estimates under appropriate causalassumptions. We introduce NATURAL, a novel family of causal effect estimatorsbuilt with LLMs that operate over datasets of unstructured text. Our estimatorsuse LLM conditional distributions (over variables of interest, given the textdata) to assist in the computation of classical estimators of causal effect. Weovercome a number of technical challenges to realize this idea, such asautomating data curation and using LLMs to impute missing information. Weprepare six (two synthetic and four real) observational datasets, paired withcorresponding ground truth in the form of randomized trials, which we used tosystematically evaluate each step of our pipeline. NATURAL estimatorsdemonstrate remarkable performance, yielding causal effect estimates that fallwithin 3 percentage points of their ground truth counterparts, including onreal-world Phase 3/4 clinical trials. Our results suggest that unstructuredtext data is a rich source of causal effect information, and NATURAL is a firststep towards an automated pipeline to tap this resource.</description><author>Nikita Dhawan, Leonardo Cotta, Karen Ullrich, Rahul G.

In this paper, we aim todevelop open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) technique in aerial images thatscales up object vocabulary size beyond training data. The performance of OVDgreatly relies on the quality of class-agnostic region proposals andpseudo-labels for novel object categories. To simultaneously generatehigh-quality proposals and pseudo-labels, we propose CastDet, a CLIP-activatedstudent-teacher open-vocabulary object Detection framework. Our end-to-endframework following the student-teacher self-learning mechanism employs theRemoteCLIP model as an extra omniscient teacher with rich knowledge. By doingso, our approach boosts not only novel object proposals but alsoclassification. Furthermore, we devise a dynamic label queue strategy tomaintain high-quality pseudo labels during batch training. We conduct extensiveexperiments on multiple existing aerial object detection datasets, which areset up for the OVD task. Experimental results demonstrate our CastDet achievingsuperior open-vocabulary detection performance, e.g., reaching 46.5% mAP onVisDroneZSD novel categories, which outperforms the state-of-the-artopen-vocabulary detectors by 21.0% mAP.

Contemporary deep learning-based vascular segmentation models rivalhuman accuracy but still face substantial challenges in accurately segmentingminuscule blood vessels in neural network applications. Due to the necessity ofmultiple downsampling operations in the CNN models, fine details fromhigh-resolution images are inevitably lost. The objective of this study is todesign a structure to capture the delicate and small blood vessels. Methods: Toaddress these issues, we propose a novel network (KaLDeX) for vascularsegmentation leveraging a Kalman filter based linear deformable cross attention(LDCA) module, integrated within a UNet++ framework. Our approach is based ontwo key components: Kalman filter (KF) based linear deformable convolution (LD)and cross-attention (CA) modules. The LD module is designed to adaptivelyadjust the focus on thin vessels that might be overlooked in standardconvolution. The CA module improves the global understanding of vascularstructures by aggregating the detailed features from the LD module with thehigh level features from the UNet++ architecture. Finally, we adopt atopological loss function based on persistent homology to constrain thetopological continuity of the segmentation. Results: The proposed method isevaluated on retinal fundus image datasets (DRIVE, CHASE_BD1, and STARE) aswell as the 3mm and 6mm of the OCTA-500 dataset, achieving an average accuracy(ACC) of 97.25%, 97.77%, 97.85%, 98.89%, and 98.21%, respectively. Conclusions:Empirical evidence shows that our method outperforms the current best models ondifferent vessel segmentation datasets.

Our assessment of ten leading models across fivescenarios (each with 337 use cases) reveals systematic inconsistencies inmaintaining user-specific consideration, with even top-rated "harmless" modelsmaking recommendations that should be recognised as obviously harmful to theuser given the context provided. Key failure modes include inappropriateweighing of conflicting preferences, sycophancy (prioritising user preferencesabove safety), a lack of attentiveness to critical user information within thecontext window, and inconsistent application of user-specific knowledge. Thesame systematic biases were observed in OpenAI's o1, suggesting that strongreasoning capacities do not necessarily transfer to this kind of personalisedthinking. We find that prompting LLMs to consider safety-critical contextsignificantly improves performance, unlike a generic 'harmless and helpful'instruction. Based on these findings, we propose research directions forembedding self-reflection capabilities, online user modelling, and dynamic riskassessment in AI assistants.

Neuralstochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modelingtechnique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms ofan SDE with neural networks. However, current algorithms for training NeuralSDEs require backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting theirscalability and stability. To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching(TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassingbackpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching techniquefrom generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establishnecessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data.

Differentiable causal discovery (DCD) methods are effective inuncovering causal relationships from observational data; however, theseapproaches often suffer from limited interpretability and face challenges inincorporating domain-specific prior knowledge. In contrast, Large LanguageModels (LLMs)-based causal discovery approaches have recently been showncapable of providing useful priors for causal discovery but struggle withformal causal reasoning. In this paper, we propose LLM-DCD, which uses an LLMto initialize the optimization of the maximum likelihood objective function ofDCD approaches, thereby incorporating strong priors into the discovery method.To achieve this initialization, we design our objective function to depend onan explicitly defined adjacency matrix of the causal graph as its onlyvariational parameter. Directly optimizing the explicitly defined adjacencymatrix provides a more interpretable approach to causal discovery.Additionally, we demonstrate higher accuracy on key benchmarking datasets ofour approach compared to state-of-the-art alternatives, and provide empiricalevidence that the quality of the initialization directly impacts the quality ofthe final output of our DCD approach. LLM-DCD opens up new opportunities fortraditional causal discovery methods like DCD to benefit from futureimprovements in the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</description><author>Shiv Kampani, David Hidary, Constantijn van der Poel, Martin Ganahl, Brenda Miao</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 15:43:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21141v1</guid></item><item><title>uOttawa at LegalLens-2024: Transformer-based Classification Experiments</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21139v1</link><description>This paper presents the methods used for LegalLens-2024 shared task, whichfocused on detecting legal violations within unstructured textual data andassociating these violations with potentially affected individuals.

Recent works address the problem and generate better 3Dresults either by finetuning a multi-view diffusion model or training a fastfeed-forward model. However, they still lack intricate textures and complexgeometries due to inconsistency and limited generated resolution. Tosimultaneously achieve high fidelity, consistency, and efficiency in singleimage-to-3D, we propose a novel framework Unique3D that includes a multi-viewdiffusion model with a corresponding normal diffusion model to generatemulti-view images with their normal maps, a multi-level upscale process toprogressively improve the resolution of generated orthographic multi-views, aswell as an instant and consistent mesh reconstruction algorithm called ISOMER,which fully integrates the color and geometric priors into mesh results.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Unique3D significantly outperformsother image-to-3D baselines in terms of geometric and textural details.</description><author>Kailu Wu, Fangfu Liu, Zhihan Cai, Runjie Yan, Hanyang Wang, Yating Hu, Yueqi Duan, Kaisheng Ma</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 15:41:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20343v3</guid></item><item><title>Amalgam: A Framework for Obfuscated Neural Network Training on the Cloud</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03405v2</link><description>Training a proprietary Neural Network (NN) model with a proprietary dataseton the cloud comes at the risk of exposing the model architecture and thedataset to the cloud service provider.

As aresult, it is customary to fall back on simulators when creating benchmarktasks. Simulators offer great control but are often too simplistic to makechallenging tasks, either because they are hand-designed and lack the nuancesof real-world data, or because they are fit to observational data withoutstructural constraints. In this work, we propose a general, repeatable strategyfor turning observational data into sequential structural causal models andchallenging estimation tasks by following two simple principles: 1) fittingreal-world data where possible, and 2) creating complexity by composing simple,hand-designed mechanisms. We implement these ideas in a highly configurablesoftware package and apply it to the well-known Adult income data set toconstruct the IncomeSCM simulator. From this, we devise multiple estimationtasks and sample data sets to compare established estimators of causal effects.The tasks present a suitable challenge, with effect estimates varying greatlyin quality between methods, despite similar performance in the modeling offactual outcomes, highlighting the need for dedicated causal estimators andmodel selection criteria.</description><author>Fredrik D.

Thisleads to subject-irrelevant attributes infiltrating the generation process,ultimately compromising the personalization quality in both editability and IDpreservation. In this paper, we present DisEnvisioner, a novel approach foreffectively extracting and enriching the subject-essential features whilefiltering out -irrelevant information, enabling exceptional customizationperformance, in a tuning-free manner and using only a single image.Specifically, the feature of the subject and other irrelevant components areeffectively separated into distinctive visual tokens, enabling a much moreaccurate customization. Aiming to further improving the ID consistency, weenrich the disentangled features, sculpting them into more granularrepresentations.

Counterfactual explanations, withroots in human reasoning, identify the minimal input changes needed to obtain agiven output and, hence, are crucial for supporting decision-making. Despitetheir importance, the evaluation of these explanations often lacks grounding inuser studies and remains fragmented, with existing metrics not fully capturinghuman perspectives. To address this challenge, we developed a diverse set of 30counterfactual scenarios and collected ratings across 8 evaluation metrics from206 respondents. Subsequently, we fine-tuned different Large Language Models(LLMs) to predict average or individual human judgment across these metrics.Our methodology allowed LLMs to achieve an accuracy of up to 63% in zero-shotevaluations and 85% (over a 3-classes prediction) with fine-tuning across allmetrics.

Three autoregressivemodels were compared: a convolutional autoencoder combined with a convolutionalLSTM (ConvLSTM), a variational autoencoder (VAE) combined with a ConvLSTM and ahybrid model that combines proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with a LSTM(POD-DL). These models were tested on two high-dimensional, nonlinear datasetsrepresenting the velocity field of flow past a circular cylinder in bothlaminar and turbulent regimes. The study used latent dimension methods,enabling a bijective reduction of high-dimensional dynamics into a lower-orderspace to facilitate future predictions. While the VAE and ConvLSTM modelsaccurately predicted laminar flow, the hybrid POD-DL model outperformed theothers across both laminar and turbulent flow regimes. This success isattributed to the model's ability to incorporate modal decomposition, reducingthe dimensionality of the data, by a non-parametric method, and simplifying theforecasting component. By leveraging POD, the model not only gained insightinto the underlying physics, improving prediction accuracy with less trainingdata, but also reduce the number of trainable parameters as POD isnon-parametric. The findings emphasize the potential of hybrid models,particularly those integrating modal decomposition and deep learning, inpredicting complex flow dynamics.</description><author>Rodrigo Abadía-Heredia, Adrián Corrochano, Manuel Lopez-Martin, Soledad Le Clainche</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 15:31:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17884v2</guid></item><item><title>Fast Calibrated Explanations: Efficient and Uncertainty-Aware Explanations for Machine Learning Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21129v1</link><description>This paper introduces Fast Calibrated Explanations, a method designed forgenerating rapid, uncertainty-aware explanations for machine learning models.By incorporating perturbation techniques from ConformaSight - a globalexplanation framework - into the core elements of Calibrated Explanations (CE),we achieve significant speedups.

The emergence of deep learningmethods for protein modeling has demonstrated superior results at lower costscompared to traditional approaches such as directed evolution and rationaldesign. In mutation effect prediction, the key to pre-training deep learningmodels lies in accurately interpreting the complex relationships among proteinsequence, structure, and function. This study introduces a retrieval-enhancedprotein language model for comprehensive analysis of native properties fromsequence and local structural interactions, as well as evolutionary propertiesfrom retrieved homologous sequences. The state-of-the-art performance of theproposed ProtREM is validated on over 2 million mutants across 217 assays froman open benchmark (ProteinGym). We also conducted post-hoc analyses of themodel's ability to improve the stability and binding affinity of a VHHantibody. Additionally, we designed 10 new mutants on a DNA polymerase andconducted wet-lab experiments to evaluate their enhanced activity at highertemperatures.
