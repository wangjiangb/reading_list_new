Thisevolution ranges from hand-crafted methods, through the era of deep learning,to more recent developments focused on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3DGaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations. Recognizing the growing body ofresearch and the absence of a comprehensive survey on the topic, this paperaims to provide the first comprehensive overview of SLAM progress through thelens of the latest advancements in radiance fields. It sheds light on thebackground, evolutionary path, inherent strengths and limitations, and servesas a fundamental reference to highlight the dynamic progress and specificchallenges.</description><author>Fabio Tosi, Youmin Zhang, Ziren Gong, Erik Sandström, Stefano Mattoccia, Martin R.

In particular, we identify two under-exploredcritical problems: the neglect of the physically grounded reasoning (countingand position understanding) and the potential of using highly capable text andimage generation models for semantic counterfactual fine-tuning. Our workpioneers an approach that addresses these gaps. We first spotlight thenear-chance performance of multimodal models like CLIP and LLaVA in physicallygrounded compositional reasoning. We then apply simple data augmentation usinga grounded image generation model, GLIGEN, to generate finetuning data,resulting in significant performance improvements: +33% and +37% for CLIP andLLaVA, respectively, on our newly curated Flickr30k-Positions benchmark.Moreover, we exploit the capabilities of high-performing text generation andimage generation models, specifically GPT-4V and DALLE-3, to curate challengingsemantic counterfactuals, thereby further enhancing compositional reasoningcapabilities on benchmarks such as SugarCrepe, where CounterCurate outperformsGPT-4V.</description><author>Jianrui Zhang, Mu Cai, Tengyang Xie, Yong Jae Lee</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:59:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13254v1</guid></item><item><title>BiMediX: Bilingual Medical Mixture of Experts LLM</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13253v1</link><description>In this paper, we introduce BiMediX, the first bilingual medical mixture ofexperts LLM designed for seamless interaction in both English and Arabic.

First, we conduct a pilot study based on a 1D signaland relate our findings to 3D scenarios, where the naive joint poseoptimization on voxel-based NeRFs can easily lead to sub-optimal solutions.Moreover, based on the analysis of the frequency spectrum, we propose to applyconvolutional Gaussian filters on 2D and 3D radiance fields for acoarse-to-fine training schedule that enables joint camera pose optimization.Leveraging the decomposition property in decomposed low-rank tensor, our methodachieves an equivalent effect to brute-force 3D convolution with only incurringlittle computational overhead. To further improve the robustness and stabilityof joint optimization, we also propose techniques of smoothed 2D supervision,randomly scaled kernel parameters, and edge-guided loss mask. Extensivequantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our proposedframework achieves superior performance in novel view synthesis as well asrapid convergence for optimization.</description><author>Bo-Yu Cheng, Wei-Chen Chiu, Yu-Lun Liu</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:59:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13252v1</guid></item><item><title>FlashTex: Fast Relightable Mesh Texturing with LightControlNet</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13251v1</link><description>Manually creating textures for 3D meshes is time-consuming, even for expertvisual content creators. We propose a fast approach for automatically texturingan input 3D mesh based on a user-provided text prompt. Importantly, ourapproach disentangles lighting from surface material/reflectance in theresulting texture so that the mesh can be properly relit and rendered in anylighting environment. We introduce LightControlNet, a new text-to-image modelbased on the ControlNet architecture, which allows the specification of thedesired lighting as a conditioning image to the model. Our text-to-texturepipeline then constructs the texture in two stages. The first stage produces asparse set of visually consistent reference views of the mesh usingLightControlNet. The second stage applies a texture optimization based on ScoreDistillation Sampling (SDS) that works with LightControlNet to increase thetexture quality while disentangling surface material from lighting. Ourpipeline is significantly faster than previous text-to-texture methods, whileproducing high-quality and relightable textures.</description><author>Kangle Deng, Timothy Omernick, Alexander Weiss, Deva Ramanan, Jun-Yan Zhu, Tinghui Zhou, Maneesh Agrawala</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:59:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13251v1</guid></item><item><title>Video ReCap: Recursive Captioning of Hour-Long Videos</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13250v1</link><description>Most video captioning models are designed to process short video clips of fewseconds and output text describing low-level visual concepts (e.g., objects,scenes, atomic actions). However, most real-world videos last for minutes orhours and have a complex hierarchical structure spanning different temporalgranularities. We propose Video ReCap, a recursive video captioning model thatcan process video inputs of dramatically different lengths (from 1 second to 2hours) and output video captions at multiple hierarchy levels. The recursivevideo-language architecture exploits the synergy between different videohierarchies and can process hour-long videos efficiently. We utilize acurriculum learning training scheme to learn the hierarchical structure ofvideos, starting from clip-level captions describing atomic actions, thenfocusing on segment-level descriptions, and concluding with generatingsummaries for hour-long videos. Furthermore, we introduce Ego4D-HCap dataset byaugmenting Ego4D with 8,267 manually collected long-range video summaries. Ourrecursive model can flexibly generate captions at different hierarchy levelswhile also being useful for other complex video understanding tasks, such asVideoQA on EgoSchema.

We ask whether these advances carry over toother text summarization domains. We propose a new evaluation benchmark ontopic-focused dialogue summarization, generated by LLMs of varying sizes. Weprovide binary sentence-level human annotations of the factual consistency ofthese summaries along with detailed explanations of factually inconsistentsentences. Our analysis shows that existing LLMs hallucinate significantamounts of factual errors in the dialogue domain, regardless of the model'ssize. On the other hand, when LLMs, including GPT-4, serve as binary factualevaluators, they perform poorly and can be outperformed by prevailingstate-of-the-art specialized factuality evaluation metrics. Finally, weconducted an analysis of hallucination types with a curated error taxonomy. Wefind that there are diverse errors and error distributions in model-generatedsummaries and that non-LLM based metrics can capture all error types betterthan LLM-based evaluators.</description><author>Liyan Tang, Igor Shalyminov, Amy Wing-mei Wong, Jon Burnsky, Jake W.

Introduced by Lasry and Lions, and Huang, Caines andMalham\'e, Mean Field Games (MFGs) rely on a mean-field approximation to allowthe number of players to grow to infinity. Traditional methods for solvingthese games generally rely on solving partial or stochastic differentialequations with a full knowledge of the model. Recently, Reinforcement Learning(RL) has appeared promising to solve complex problems at scale. The combinationof RL and MFGs is promising to solve games at a very large scale both in termsof population size and environment complexity. In this survey, we review thequickly growing recent literature on RL methods to learn equilibria and socialoptima in MFGs. We first identify the most common settings (static, stationary,and evolutive) of MFGs. We then present a general framework for classicaliterative methods (based on best-response computation or policy evaluation) tosolve MFGs in an exact way. Building on these algorithms and the connectionwith Markov Decision Processes, we explain how RL can be used to learn MFGsolutions in a model-free way. Last, we present numerical illustrations on abenchmark problem, and conclude with some perspectives.</description><author>Mathieu Laurière, Sarah Perrin, Julien Pérolat, Sertan Girgin, Paul Muller, Romuald Élie, Matthieu Geist, Olivier Pietquin</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:56:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12944v3</guid></item><item><title>Textless Low-Resource Speech-to-Speech Translation With Unit Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15405v2</link><description>Existing speech-to-speech translation models fall into two camps: textlessmodels trained with hundreds of hours of parallel speech data or unsupervisedmodels that leverage text as an intermediate step. Both approaches limitbuilding speech-to-speech translation models for a wide range of languages, asthey exclude languages that are primarily spoken and language pairs that lacklarge-scale parallel speech data. We present a new framework for trainingtextless low-resource speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) systems that onlyneed dozens of hours of parallel speech data. We reformulate S2ST as aunit-to-unit seq2seq translation task, and start by pretraining a model onlarge-scale monolingual speech data. Then, we finetune it with a small amountof parallel speech data ($20-60$ hours). Lastly, we improve model performancethrough an unsupervised backtranslation objective. We train and evaluate ourmodels for English-to-German, German-to-English and Marathi-to-Englishtranslation on three different domains (European Parliament, Common Voice, andAll India Radio) with single-speaker synthesized speech data. Evaluated usingthe ASR-BLEU metric, our models achieve reasonable performance on all threedomains, with some being within 1-2 points of our supervised topline.</description><author>Anuj Diwan, Anirudh Srinivasan, David Harwath, Eunsol Choi</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:55:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15405v2</guid></item><item><title>VADv2: End-to-End Vectorized Autonomous Driving via Probabilistic Planning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13243v1</link><description>Learning a human-like driving policy from large-scale driving demonstrationsis promising, but the uncertainty and non-deterministic nature of planning makeit challenging. In this work, to cope with the uncertainty problem, we proposeVADv2, an end-to-end driving model based on probabilistic planning. VADv2 takesmulti-view image sequences as input in a streaming manner, transforms sensordata into environmental token embeddings, outputs the probabilisticdistribution of action, and samples one action to control the vehicle. Onlywith camera sensors, VADv2 achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop performance onthe CARLA Town05 benchmark, significantly outperforming all existing methods.It runs stably in a fully end-to-end manner, even without the rule-basedwrapper.

It is necessary to balance out the class distributionwhile training a model for decent results. However, in the case of rare medicaldiseases, images from affected patients are much harder to come by compared toimages from non-affected patients, resulting in unwanted class imbalance.Various processes of tackling class imbalance issues have been explored so far,each having its fair share of drawbacks. In this research, we propose anoutlier detection based binary medical image classification technique which canhandle even the most extreme case of class imbalance. We have utilized adataset of malaria parasitized and uninfected cells. An autoencoder modeltitled AnoMalNet is trained with only the uninfected cell images at thebeginning and then used to classify both the affected and non-affected cellimages by thresholding a loss value. We have achieved an accuracy, precision,recall, and F1 score of 98.49%, 97.07%, 100%, and 98.52% respectively,performing better than large deep learning models and other published works. Asour proposed approach can provide competitive results without needing thedisease-positive samples during training, it should prove to be useful inbinary disease classification on imbalanced datasets.</description><author>Aminul Huq, Md Tanzim Reza, Shahriar Hossain, Shakib Mahmud Dipto</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:54:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05789v2</guid></item><item><title>Federated Causal Discovery from Heterogeneous Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13241v1</link><description>Conventional causal discovery methods rely on centralized data, which isinconsistent with the decentralized nature of data in many real-worldsituations. This discrepancy has motivated the development of federated causaldiscovery (FCD) approaches. However, existing FCD methods may be limited bytheir potentially restrictive assumptions of identifiable functional causalmodels or homogeneous data distributions, narrowing their applicability indiverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel FCD method attempting toaccommodate arbitrary causal models and heterogeneous data. We first utilize asurrogate variable corresponding to the client index to account for the dataheterogeneity across different clients. We then develop a federated conditionalindependence test (FCIT) for causal skeleton discovery and establish afederated independent change principle (FICP) to determine causal directions.These approaches involve constructing summary statistics as a proxy of the rawdata to protect data privacy. Owing to the nonparametric properties, FCIT andFICP make no assumption about particular functional forms, thereby facilitatingthe handling of arbitrary causal models. We conduct extensive experiments onsynthetic and real datasets to show the efficacy of our method.

Many previous approachesrely on massive human-annotated data to perform entity typing. Nevertheless,collecting such data in highly specialized science and engineering domains(e.g., software engineering and security) can be time-consuming and costly,without mentioning the domain gaps between training and inference data if themodel needs to be applied to confidential datasets. In this paper, we study thetask of seed-guided fine-grained entity typing in science and engineeringdomains, which takes the name and a few seed entities for each entity type asthe only supervision and aims to classify new entity mentions into both seenand unseen types (i.e., those without seed entities). To solve this problem, wepropose SEType which first enriches the weak supervision by finding moreentities for each seen type from an unlabeled corpus using the contextualizedrepresentations of pre-trained language models. It then matches the enrichedentities to unlabeled text to get pseudo-labeled samples and trains a textualentailment model that can make inferences for both seen and unseen types.Extensive experiments on two datasets covering four domains demonstrate theeffectiveness of SEType in comparison with various baselines.</description><author>Yu Zhang, Yunyi Zhang, Yanzhen Shen, Yu Deng, Lucian Popa, Larisa Shwartz, ChengXiang Zhai, Jiawei Han</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:50:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13129v2</guid></item><item><title>Unlocking Insights: Semantic Search in Jupyter Notebooks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13234v1</link><description>Semantic search, a process aimed at delivering highly relevant search resultsby comprehending the searcher's intent and the contextual meaning of termswithin a searchable dataspace, plays a pivotal role in information retrieval.In this paper, we investigate the application of large language models toenhance semantic search capabilities, specifically tailored for the domain ofJupyter Notebooks. Our objective is to retrieve generated outputs, such asfigures or tables, associated functions and methods, and other pertinentinformation. We demonstrate a semantic search framework that achieves a comprehensivesemantic understanding of the entire notebook's contents, enabling it toeffectively handle various types of user queries. Key components of thisframework include: 1). A data preprocessor is designed to handle diverse types of cells withinJupyter Notebooks, encompassing both markdown and code cells. 2). An innovativemethodology is devised to address token size limitations that arise withcode-type cells. We implement a finer-grained approach to data input,transitioning from the cell level to the function level, effectively resolvingthese issues.</description><author>Lan Li, Jinpeng Lv</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:49:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13234v1</guid></item><item><title>SMORE: Similarity-based Hyperdimensional Domain Adaptation for Multi-Sensor Time Series Classification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13233v1</link><description>Many real-world applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) employ machinelearning (ML) algorithms to analyze time series information collected byinterconnected sensors. However, distribution shift, a fundamental challenge indata-driven ML, arises when a model is deployed on a data distributiondifferent from the training data and can substantially degrade modelperformance. Additionally, increasingly sophisticated deep neural networks(DNNs) are required to capture intricate spatial and temporal dependencies inmulti-sensor time series data, often exceeding the capabilities of today's edgedevices. In this paper, we propose SMORE, a novel resource-efficient domainadaptation (DA) algorithm for multi-sensor time series classification,leveraging the efficient and parallel operations of hyperdimensional computing.SMORE dynamically customizes test-time models with explicit consideration ofthe domain context of each sample to mitigate the negative impacts of domainshifts. Our evaluation on a variety of multi-sensor time series classificationtasks shows that SMORE achieves on average 1.98% higher accuracy thanstate-of-the-art (SOTA) DNN-based DA algorithms with 18.81x faster training and4.63x faster inference.</description><author>Junyao Wang, Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:48:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13233v1</guid></item><item><title>A Touch, Vision, and Language Dataset for Multimodal Alignment</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13232v1</link><description>Touch is an important sensing modality for humans, but it has not yet beenincorporated into a multimodal generative language model. This is partially dueto the difficulty of obtaining natural language labels for tactile data and thecomplexity of aligning tactile readings with both visual observations andlanguage descriptions. As a step towards bridging that gap, this workintroduces a new dataset of 44K in-the-wild vision-touch pairs, with Englishlanguage labels annotated by humans (10%) and textual pseudo-labels from GPT-4V(90%). We use this dataset to train a vision-language-aligned tactile encoderfor open-vocabulary classification and a touch-vision-language (TVL) model fortext generation using the trained encoder. Results suggest that byincorporating touch, the TVL model improves (+29% classification accuracy)touch-vision-language alignment over existing models trained on any pair ofthose modalities. Although only a small fraction of the dataset ishuman-labeled, the TVL model demonstrates improved visual-tactile understandingover GPT-4V (+12%) and open-source vision-language models (+32%) on a newtouch-vision understanding benchmark.

LargeLanguage Models (LLMs), promoted as repositories of collective human knowledge,raise a pivotal question: do these models genuinely encapsulate the diverseknowledge adopted by different cultures? Our study reveals that these modelsdemonstrate greater cultural alignment along two dimensions -- firstly, whenprompted with the dominant language of a specific culture, and secondly, whenpretrained with a refined mixture of languages employed by that culture. Wequantify cultural alignment by simulating sociological surveys, comparing modelresponses to those of actual survey participants as references. Specifically,we replicate a survey conducted in various regions of Egypt and the UnitedStates through prompting LLMs with different pretraining data mixtures in bothArabic and English with the personas of the real respondents and the surveyquestions. Further analysis reveals that misalignment becomes more pronouncedfor underrepresented personas and for culturally sensitive topics, such asthose probing social values. Finally, we introduce Anthropological Prompting, anovel method leveraging anthropological reasoning to enhance culturalalignment. Our study emphasizes the necessity for a more balanced multilingualpretraining dataset to better represent the diversity of human experience andthe plurality of different cultures with many implications on the topic ofcross-lingual transfer.</description><author>Badr AlKhamissi, Muhammad ElNokrashy, Mai AlKhamissi, Mona Diab</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:47:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13231v1</guid></item><item><title>Unsupervised Optimisation of GNNs for Node Clustering</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07845v2</link><description>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be trained to detect communities within agraph by learning from the duality of feature and connectivity information.Currently, the common approach for optimisation of GNNs is to use comparisonsto ground-truth for hyperparameter tuning and model selection. In this work, weshow that nodes can be clustered into communities with GNNs by solelyoptimising for modularity, without any comparison to ground-truth. Althoughmodularity is a graph partitioning quality metric, we show that this can beused to optimise GNNs that also encode features without a drop in performance.We take it a step further and also study whether the unsupervised metricperformance can predict ground-truth performance. To investigate why modularitycan be used to optimise GNNs, we design synthetic experiments that show thelimitations of this approach. The synthetic graphs are created to highlightcurrent capabilities in distinct, random and zero information space partitionsin attributed graphs. We conclude that modularity can be used forhyperparameter optimisation and model selection on real-world datasets as wellas being a suitable proxy for predicting ground-truth performance, however,GNNs fail to balance the information duality when the spaces containconflicting signals.</description><author>William Leeney, Ryan McConville</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:46:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07845v2</guid></item><item><title>Assessing the Impact of Prompting Methods on ChatGPT's Mathematical Capabilities</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15006v2</link><description>This study critically evaluates the efficacy of prompting methods inenhancing the mathematical reasoning capability of large language models(LLMs).

However, with limitedresources, it is challenging to determine the best type of annotations whenannotating massive amounts of unlabeled data. To address this issue, we focuson polyps in colonoscopy videos and pancreatic tumors in abdominal CT scans;both applications require significant effort and time for pixel-wise annotationdue to the high dimensional nature of the data, involving either temporary orspatial dimensions. In this paper, we develop a new annotation strategy, termedDrag&amp;Drop, which simplifies the annotation process to drag and drop. Thisannotation strategy is more efficient, particularly for temporal and volumetricimaging, than other types of weak annotations, such as per-pixel, boundingboxes, scribbles, ellipses, and points. Furthermore, to exploit our Drag&amp;Dropannotations, we develop a novel weakly supervised learning method based on thewatershed algorithm. Experimental results show that our method achieves betterdetection and localization performance than alternative weak annotations and,more importantly, achieves similar performance to that trained on detailedper-pixel annotations. Interestingly, we find that, with limited resources,allocating weak annotations from a diverse patient population can foster modelsmore robust to unseen images than allocating per-pixel annotations for a smallset of images. In summary, this research proposes an efficient annotationstrategy for tumor detection and localization that is less accurate thanper-pixel annotations but useful for creating large-scale datasets forscreening tumors in various medical modalities.</description><author>Yu-Cheng Chou, Bowen Li, Deng-Ping Fan, Alan Yuille, Zongwei Zhou</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:43:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15098v2</guid></item><item><title>Smaug: Fixing Failure Modes of Preference Optimisation with DPO-Positive</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13228v1</link><description>Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) is effective at significantly improvingthe performance of large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks such asreasoning, summarisation, and alignment. Using pairs of preferred anddispreferred data, DPO models the \textit{relative} probability of picking oneresponse over another. In this work, first we show theoretically that thestandard DPO loss can lead to a \textit{reduction} of the model's likelihood ofthe preferred examples, as long as the relative probability between thepreferred and dispreferred classes increases. We then show empirically thatthis phenomenon occurs when fine-tuning LLMs on common datasets, especiallydatasets in which the edit distance between pairs of completions is low. Usingthese insights, we design DPO-Positive (DPOP), a new loss function and trainingprocedure which avoids this failure mode. Surprisingly, we also find that DPOPsignificantly outperforms DPO across a wide variety of datasets and downstreamtasks, including datasets with high edit distances between completions. Byfine-tuning with DPOP, we create and release Smaug-34B and Smaug-72B, whichachieve state-of-the-art open-source performance. Notably, Smaug-72B is nearly2\% better than any other open-source model on the HuggingFace Open LLMLeaderboard and becomes the first open-source LLM to surpass an averageaccuracy of 80\%.</description><author>Arka Pal, Deep Karkhanis, Samuel Dooley, Manley Roberts, Siddartha Naidu, Colin White</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:42:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13228v1</guid></item><item><title>NeRF Solves Undersampled MRI Reconstruction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13226v1</link><description>This article presents a novel undersampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)technique that leverages the concept of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). Withradial undersampling, the corresponding imaging problem can be reformulatedinto an image modeling task from sparse-view rendered data; therefore, a highdimensional MR image is obtainable from undersampled $k$-space data by takingadvantage of implicit neural representation. A multi-layer perceptron, which isdesigned to output an image intensity from a spatial coordinate, learns the MRphysics-driven rendering relation between given measurement data and desiredimage. Effective undersampling strategies for high-quality neuralrepresentation are investigated. The proposed method serves two benefits: (i)The learning is based fully on single undersampled $k$-space data, not a bunchof measured data and target image sets. It can be used potentially fordiagnostic MR imaging, such as fetal MRI, where data acquisition is relativelyrare or limited against diversity of clinical images while undersampledreconstruction is highly demanded. (ii) A reconstructed MR image is ascan-specific representation highly adaptive to the given $k$-spacemeasurement. Numerous experiments validate the feasibility and capability ofthe proposed approach.</description><author>Tae Jun Jang, Chang Min Hyun</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:37:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13226v1</guid></item><item><title>Rethinking Information Structures in RLHF: Reward Generalization from a Graph Theory Perspective</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10184v3</link><description>There is a trilemma in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF): theincompatibility between highly diverse contexts, low labeling cost, andreliable alignment performance. Here we aim to mitigate such incompatibilitythrough the design of dataset information structures during reward modeling,and meanwhile propose new, generalizable methods of analysis that have widerapplications, including potentially shedding light on goal misgeneralization.Specifically, we first reexamine the RLHF process and propose a theoreticalframework portraying it as an autoencoding process over text distributions. Ourframework formalizes the RLHF objective of ensuring distributional consistencybetween human preference and large language model (LLM) behavior. Based on thisframework, we introduce a new method to model generalization in the rewardmodeling stage of RLHF, the induced Bayesian network (IBN). Drawing from randomgraph theory and causal analysis, it enables empirically grounded derivation ofgeneralization error bounds, a key improvement over classical methods ofgeneralization analysis. An insight from our analysis is the superiority of thetree-based information structure in reward modeling, compared to chain-basedbaselines in conventional RLHF methods. We derive that in complex contexts withlimited data, the tree-based reward model (RM) induces up to $\Theta(\logn/\log\log n)$ times less variance than chain-based RM where $n$ is the datasetsize. As validation, we demonstrate that on three NLP tasks, the tree-based RMachieves 65% win rate on average against chain-based baselines. Looking ahead,we hope to extend the IBN analysis to help understand the phenomenon of goalmisgeneralization.</description><author>Tianyi Qiu, Fanzhi Zeng, Jiaming Ji, Dong Yan, Kaile Wang, Jiayi Zhou, Han Yang, Josef Dai, Xuehai Pan, Yaodong Yang</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:37:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10184v3</guid></item><item><title>AgentMD: Empowering Language Agents for Risk Prediction with Large-Scale Clinical Tool Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13225v1</link><description>Clinical calculators play a vital role in healthcare by offering accurateevidence-based predictions for various purposes such as prognosis.Nevertheless, their widespread utilization is frequently hindered by usabilitychallenges, poor dissemination, and restricted functionality. Augmenting largelanguage models with extensive collections of clinical calculators presents anopportunity to overcome these obstacles and improve workflow efficiency, butthe scalability of the manual curation process poses a significant challenge.In response, we introduce AgentMD, a novel language agent capable of curatingand applying clinical calculators across various clinical contexts. Using thepublished literature, AgentMD has automatically curated a collection of 2,164diverse clinical calculators with executable functions and structureddocumentation, collectively named RiskCalcs. Manual evaluations show thatRiskCalcs tools achieve an accuracy of over 80% on three quality metrics. Atinference time, AgentMD can automatically select and apply the relevantRiskCalcs tools given any patient description. On the newly established RiskQAbenchmark, AgentMD significantly outperforms chain-of-thought prompting withGPT-4 (87.7% vs. 40.9% in accuracy). Additionally, we also applied AgentMD toreal-world clinical notes for analyzing both population-level and risk-levelpatient characteristics.

We propose a formulation of the problem of EVCS control underuncertainty, and implement two Multi-Stage Stochastic Programming approachesthat leverage user-provided information, namely, Model Predictive Control andTwo-Stage Stochastic Programming. The model addresses uncertainties in chargingsession start and end times, as well as in energy demand. A user's behaviormodel based on a sojourn-time-dependent stochastic process enhances costreduction while maintaining customer satisfaction. The benefits of the twoproposed methods are showcased against two baselines over a 22-day simulationusing a real-world dataset. The two-stage approach proves robust against earlydisconnections, considering a more significant number of uncertainty scenariosfor optimization. The algorithm prioritizing user satisfaction over electricitycost achieves a 20% and 36% improvement in two user satisfaction metricscompared to an industry-standard baseline. Additionally, the algorithm strikingthe best balance between cost and user satisfaction exhibits a mere 3% relativecost increase compared to the theoretically optimal baseline - for which thenonanticipativity constraint is relaxed - while attaining 94% and 84% of theuser satisfaction performance in the two used satisfaction metrics.</description><author>Alban Puech, Tristan Rigaut, William Templier, Maud Tournoud</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:37:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13224v1</guid></item><item><title>RoCode: A Dataset for Measuring Code Intelligence from Problem Definitions in Romanian</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13222v1</link><description>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful andhave become capable of solving a plethora of tasks through proper instructionsin natural language.

While early graph ML methods focused primarily on small organicmolecules, recently, the scope of graph ML has expanded to include inorganicmaterials. Modelling the periodicity and symmetry of inorganic crystallinematerials poses unique challenges, which existing graph ML methods are unableto address. Moving to inorganic nanomaterials increases complexity as the scaleof number of nodes within each graph can be broad ($10$ to $10^5$). The bulk ofexisting graph ML focuses on characterising molecules and materials bypredicting target properties with graphs as input. However, the most excitingapplications of graph ML will be in their generative capabilities, which iscurrently not at par with other domains such as images or text. We invite the graph ML community to address these open challenges bypresenting two new chemically-informed large-scale inorganic (CHILI)nanomaterials datasets: A medium-scale dataset (with overall &gt;6M nodes, &gt;49Medges) of mono-metallic oxide nanomaterials generated from 12 selected crystaltypes (CHILI-3K) and a large-scale dataset (with overall &gt;183M nodes, &gt;1.2Bedges) of nanomaterials generated from experimentally determined crystalstructures (CHILI-100K). We define 11 property prediction tasks and 6 structureprediction tasks, which are of special interest for nanomaterial research. Webenchmark the performance of a wide array of baseline methods and use thesebenchmarking results to highlight areas which need future work. To the best ofour knowledge, CHILI-3K and CHILI-100K are the first open-source nanomaterialdatasets of this scale -- both on the individual graph level and of the datasetas a whole -- and the only nanomaterials datasets with high structural andelemental diversity.</description><author>Ulrik Friis-Jensen, Frederik L.

The experiments in thispaper evaluate the impact and applications of an AI-based decision supportsystem integrated into an improved human-machine interface, using dynamicinflu- ence diagrams, a hidden Markov model, and deep reinforcement learning.The enhanced support system aims to reduce operator workload, improvesituational awareness, and provide different intervention strategies to theoperator adapted to the current state of both the system and human performance.Such a system can be particularly useful in cases of information overload whenmany alarms and inputs are presented all within the same time window, or forjunior operators during training. A comprehensive cross-data analysis wasconducted, involving 47 participants and a diverse range of data sources suchas smartwatch metrics, eye- tracking data, process logs, and responses fromquestionnaires. The results indicate interesting insights regarding the effec-tiveness of the approach in aiding decision-making, decreasing perceivedworkload, and increasing situational awareness for the scenarios considered.Additionally, the results provide valuable insights to compare differencesbetween styles of information gathering when using the system by individualparticipants. These findings are particularly relevant when predicting theoverall performance of the individual participant and their capacity tosuccessfully handle a plant upset and the alarms connected to it using processand human-machine interaction logs in real-time.

An Empirical Analysis on Deceptive Prompts</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13220v1</link><description>The remarkable advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) havenot rendered them immune to challenges, particularly in the context of handlingdeceptive information in prompts, thus producing hallucinated responses undersuch conditions. To quantitatively assess this vulnerability, we presentMAD-Bench, a carefully curated benchmark that contains 850 test samples dividedinto 6 categories, such as non-existent objects, count of objects, spatialrelationship, and visual confusion. We provide a comprehensive analysis ofpopular MLLMs, ranging from GPT-4V, Gemini-Pro, to open-sourced models, such asLLaVA-1.5 and CogVLM. Empirically, we observe significant performance gapsbetween GPT-4V and other models; and previous robust instruction-tuned models,such as LRV-Instruction and LLaVA-RLHF, are not effective on this newbenchmark. While GPT-4V achieves 75.02% accuracy on MAD-Bench, the accuracy ofany other model in our experiments ranges from 5% to 35%. We further propose aremedy that adds an additional paragraph to the deceptive prompts to encouragemodels to think twice before answering the question. Surprisingly, this simplemethod can even double the accuracy; however, the absolute numbers are stilltoo low to be satisfactory. We hope MAD-Bench can serve as a valuable benchmarkto stimulate further research to enhance models' resilience against deceptiveprompts.</description><author>Yusu Qian, Haotian Zhang, Yinfei Yang, Zhe Gan</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:31:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13220v1</guid></item><item><title>VideoPrism: A Foundational Visual Encoder for Video Understanding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13217v1</link><description>We introduce VideoPrism, a general-purpose video encoder that tackles diversevideo understanding tasks with a single frozen model.

Large and complex models, while achieving high accuracy, can becomputationally expensive and memory-intensive, making them impractical fordeployment on resource constrained devices. Knowledge distillation allows us tocreate small and more efficient models that retain much of the performance oftheir larger counterparts. Here we present a graph-based knowledge distillationframework to correctly identify and localize the document objects in a documentimage. Here, we design a structured graph with nodes containing proposal-levelfeatures and edges representing the relationship between the different proposalregions. Also, to reduce text bias an adaptive node sampling strategy isdesigned to prune the weight distribution and put more weightage on non-textnodes. We encode the complete graph as a knowledge representation and transferit from the teacher to the student through the proposed distillation loss byeffectively capturing both local and global information concurrently. Extensiveexperimentation on competitive benchmarks demonstrates that the proposedframework outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches.

Current "sample andselect" methods such as self-consistency (SC) rely on majority voting to scoreanswers. However, when tasks have many distinct and valid answers, selection byvoting requires a large number of samples. This makes SC prohibitivelyexpensive for interactive tasks that involve generating multiple actions(answers) sequentially. After establishing that majority voting fails toprovide consistent gains on such tasks, we demonstrate how to increase successrates by softening the scoring criterion. We introduce Soft Self-Consistency(Soft-SC), which replaces SC's discontinuous scoring with a continuous scorecomputed from model likelihoods, allowing for selection even when actions aresparsely distributed. Soft-SC improves both performance and efficiency onlong-horizon interactive tasks, requiring half as many samples as SC forcomparable or better performance. For a fixed number of samples, Soft-SC leadsto a 1.3% increase over SC in absolute success rate on writing bash programs, a6.6% increase on online shopping (WebShop), and a 4.7% increase for aninteractive household game (ALFWorld). Finally, we show that Soft-SC can beapplied to both open-source and black-box models.</description><author>Han Wang, Archiki Prasad, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:22:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13212v1</guid></item><item><title>Can Large Language Models be Good Emotional Supporter?

Given its inherentcomplexity and non-intuitive nature, ESConv dataset incorporates supportstrategies to facilitate the generation of appropriate responses. Recently,despite the remarkable conversational ability of large language models (LLMs),previous studies have suggested that they often struggle with providing usefulemotional support. Hence, this work initially analyzes the results of LLMs onESConv, revealing challenges in selecting the correct strategy and a notablepreference for a specific strategy. Motivated by these, we explore the impactof the inherent preference in LLMs on providing emotional support, andconsequently, we observe that exhibiting high preference for specificstrategies hinders effective emotional support, aggravating its robustness inpredicting the appropriate strategy. Moreover, we conduct a methodologicalstudy to offer insights into the necessary approaches for LLMs to serve asproficient emotional supporters. Our findings emphasize that (1) low preferencefor specific strategies hinders the progress of emotional support, (2) externalassistance helps reduce preference bias, and (3) LLMs alone cannot become goodemotional supporters. These insights suggest promising avenues for futureresearch to enhance the emotional intelligence of LLMs.</description><author>Dongjin Kang, Sunghwan Kim, Taeyoon Kwon, Seungjun Moon, Hyunsouk Cho, Youngjae Yu, Dongha Lee, Jinyoung Yeo</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:21:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13211v1</guid></item><item><title>Bayesian Reward Models for LLM Alignment</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13210v1</link><description>To ensure that large language model (LLM) responses are helpful andnon-toxic, we usually fine-tune a reward model on human preference data. Wethen select policy responses with high rewards (best-of-n sampling) or furtheroptimize the policy to produce responses with high rewards (reinforcementlearning from human feedback). However, this process is vulnerable to rewardoveroptimization or hacking, in which the responses selected have high rewardsdue to errors in the reward model rather than a genuine preference. This isespecially problematic as the prompt or response diverges from the trainingdata. It should be possible to mitigate these issues by training a Bayesianreward model, which signals higher uncertainty further from the training datadistribution. Therefore, we trained Bayesian reward models using Laplace-LoRA(Yang et al., 2024) and found that the resulting uncertainty estimates cansuccessfully mitigate reward overoptimization in best-of-n sampling.</description><author>Adam X.

Excess false positives arise dueto bias in the test statistic, which is obtained using nonparametric kernelridge regression. We propose three methods for bias control to correct the testlevel, based on data splitting, auxiliary data, and (where possible) simplerfunction classes. We show these combined strategies are effective both forsynthetic and real-world data.</description><author>Roman Pogodin, Antonin Schrab, Yazhe Li, Danica J.

With new projects like the Square KilometreArray (SKA), there's a growing need for better source extraction methods.Current techniques, such as CLEAN and PyBDSF, often fail to detect faintsources, highlighting the need for more accurate methods. This study proposesusing stochastic neural networks to rebuild sky models directly from dirtyimages. This method can pinpoint radio sources and measure their fluxes withrelated uncertainties, marking a potential improvement in radio sourcecharacterization. We tested this approach on 10164 images simulated with theCASA tool simalma, based on ALMA's Cycle 5.3 antenna setup. We appliedconditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) for sky modelsreconstruction, then used Photutils to determine source coordinates and fluxes,assessing the model's performance across different water vapor levels. Ourmethod showed excellence in source localization, achieving more than 90%completeness at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as low as 2. It also surpassedPyBDSF in flux estimation, accurately identifying fluxes for 96% of sources inthe test set, a significant improvement over CLEAN+ PyBDSF's 57%. ConditionalDDPMs is a powerful tool for image-to-image translation, yielding accurate androbust characterisation of radio sources, and outperforming existingmethodologies. While this study underscores its significant potential forapplications in radio astronomy, we also acknowledge certain limitations thataccompany its usage, suggesting directions for further refinement and research.</description><author>Mariia Drozdova, Vitaliy Kinakh, Omkar Bait, Olga Taran, Erica Lastufka, Miroslava Dessauges-Zavadsky, Taras Holotyak, Daniel Schaerer, Slava Voloshynovskiy</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:00:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10204v2</guid></item><item><title>Question Calibration and Multi-Hop Modeling for Temporal Question Answering</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13188v1</link><description>Many models that leverage knowledge graphs (KGs) have recently demonstratedremarkable success in question answering (QA) tasks. In the real world, manyfacts contained in KGs are time-constrained thus temporal KGQA has receivedincreasing attention. Despite the fruitful efforts of previous models intemporal KGQA, they still have several limitations. (I) They adopt pre-trainedlanguage models (PLMs) to obtain question representations, while PLMs tend tofocus on entity information and ignore entity transfer caused by temporalconstraints, and finally fail to learn specific temporal representations ofentities. (II) They neither emphasize the graph structure between entities norexplicitly model the multi-hop relationship in the graph, which will make itdifficult to solve complex multi-hop question answering. To alleviate thisproblem, we propose a novel Question Calibration and Multi-Hop Modeling(QC-MHM) approach. Specifically, We first calibrate the question representationby fusing the question and the time-constrained concepts in KG. Then, weconstruct the GNN layer to complete multi-hop message passing. Finally, thequestion representation is combined with the embedding output by the GNN togenerate the final prediction. Empirical results verify that the proposed modelachieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models in the benchmarkdataset. Notably, the Hits@1 and Hits@10 results of QC-MHM on the CronQuestionsdataset's complex questions are absolutely improved by 5.1% and 1.2% comparedto the best-performing baseline. Moreover, QC-MHM can generate interpretableand trustworthy predictions.</description><author>Chao Xue, Di Liang, Pengfei Wang, Jing Zhang</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 17:56:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13188v1</guid></item><item><title>Simplicial Convolutional Filters</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11720v3</link><description>We study linear filters for processing signals supported on abstracttopological spaces modeled as simplicial complexes, which may be interpreted asgeneralizations of graphs that account for nodes, edges, triangular faces etc.To process such signals, we develop simplicial convolutional filters defined asmatrix polynomials of the lower and upper Hodge Laplacians.

However, the algorithmic aspects ofmeasuring model calibration have remained relatively less well-explored.Motivated by [BGHN23], which proposed a rigorous framework for measuringdistances to calibration, we initiate the algorithmic study of calibrationthrough the lens of property testing. We define the problem of calibrationtesting from samples where given $n$ draws from a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ on(predictions, binary outcomes), our goal is to distinguish between the casewhere $\mathcal{D}$ is perfectly calibrated, and the case where $\mathcal{D}$is $\varepsilon$-far from calibration. We design an algorithm based on approximate linear programming, which solvescalibration testing information-theoretically optimally (up to constantfactors) in time $O(n^{1.5} \log(n))$. This improves upon state-of-the-artblack-box linear program solvers requiring $\Omega(n^\omega)$ time, where$\omega &gt; 2$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. We also developalgorithms for tolerant variants of our testing problem, and give samplecomplexity lower bounds for alternative calibration distances to the oneconsidered in this work.

Retrieval-augmentedgeneration (RAG) is a promising solution and has been widely adopted. However,a RAG system can involve multiple flexible components, and there is a lack ofbest practices regarding the optimal RAG setting for various medical purposes.To systematically evaluate such systems, we propose the Medical InformationRetrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation (MIRAGE), a first-of-its-kindbenchmark including 7,663 questions from five medical QA datasets. UsingMIRAGE, we conducted large-scale experiments with over 1.8 trillion prompttokens on 41 combinations of different corpora, retrievers, and backbone LLMsthrough the MedRAG toolkit introduced in this work. Overall, MedRAG improvesthe accuracy of six different LLMs by up to 18% over chain-of-thoughtprompting, elevating the performance of GPT-3.5 and Mixtral to GPT-4-level. Ourresults show that the combination of various medical corpora and retrieversachieves the best performance.

The combination of local,within-region dynamics and global, network-level dynamics is thought to providecomputational flexibility. However, the nature of such multiregion dynamics andthe underlying synaptic connectivity patterns remain poorly understood. Here,we study the dynamics of recurrent neural networks with multiple interconnectedregions. Within each region, neurons have a combination of random andstructured recurrent connections. Motivated by experimental evidence ofcommunication subspaces between cortical areas, these networks have low-rankconnectivity between regions, enabling selective routing of activity. Thesenetworks exhibit two interacting forms of dynamics: high-dimensionalfluctuations within regions and low-dimensional signal transmission betweenregions. To characterize this interaction, we develop a dynamical mean-fieldtheory to analyze such networks in the limit where each region containsinfinitely many neurons, with cross-region currents as key order parameters.Regions can act as both generators and transmitters of activity, roles that weshow are in conflict. Specifically, taming the complexity of activity within aregion is necessary for it to route signals to and from other regions. Unlikeprevious models of routing in neural circuits, which suppressed the activitiesof neuronal groups to control signal flow, routing in our model is achieved byexciting different high-dimensional activity patterns through a combination ofconnectivity structure and nonlinear recurrent dynamics. This theory providesinsight into the interpretation of both multiregion neural data and trainedneural networks.</description><author>David G.

Such an approach oftensuffers from over-fitting, as expert demonstrations are limited to accuratelyrepresent any occupancy distribution. On the other hand, since sub-optimal setsare much larger, there is a high chance that the imitation policy is trainedtowards sub-optimal policies. In this paper, to address these issues, wepropose a new approach based on inverse soft-Q learning, where a regularizationterm is added to the training objective, with the aim of aligning the learnedrewards with a pre-assigned reward function that allocates higher weights tostate-action pairs from expert demonstrations, and lower weights to those fromlower expertise levels. On standard benchmarks, our inverse soft-Q learningsignificantly outperforms other offline IL baselines by a large margin.</description><author>Huy Hoang, Tien Mai, Pradeep Varakantham</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 17:02:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13147v1</guid></item><item><title>OLViT: Multi-Modal State Tracking via Attention-Based Embeddings for Video-Grounded Dialog</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13146v1</link><description>We present the Object Language Video Transformer (OLViT) - a novel model forvideo dialog operating over a multi-modal attention-based dialog state tracker.Existing video dialog models struggle with questions requiring both spatial andtemporal localization within videos, long-term temporal reasoning, and accurateobject tracking across multiple dialog turns. OLViT addresses these challengesby maintaining a global dialog state based on the output of an Object StateTracker (OST) and a Language State Tracker (LST): while the OST attends to themost important objects within the video, the LST keeps track of the mostimportant linguistic co-references to previous dialog turns. In stark contrastto previous works, our approach is generic by nature and is therefore capableof learning continuous multi-modal dialog state representations of the mostrelevant objects and rounds. As a result, they can be seamlessly integratedinto Large Language Models (LLMs) and offer high flexibility in dealing withdifferent datasets and tasks. Evaluations on the challenging DVD (responseclassification) and SIMMC 2.1 (response generation) datasets show that OLViTachieves new state-of-the-art performance across both datasets.</description><author>Adnen Abdessaied, Manuel von Hochmeister, Andreas Bulling</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 17:00:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13146v1</guid></item><item><title>CMDAG: A Chinese Metaphor Dataset with Annotated Grounds as CoT for Boosting Metaphor Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13145v1</link><description>Metaphor is a prominent linguistic device in human language and literature,as they add color, imagery, and emphasis to enhance effective communication.This paper introduces a large-scale high quality annotated Chinese MetaphorCorpus, which comprises around 28K sentences drawn from a diverse range ofChinese literary sources, such as poems, prose, song lyrics, etc. To ensure theaccuracy and consistency of our annotations, we introduce a comprehensive setof guidelines.

Nonetheless, this approach concurrently introducespotential biases from human and LLM judges, questioning the reliability of theevaluation results. In this paper, we propose a novel framework forinvestigating 5 types of biases for LLM and human judges. We curate a datasetwith 142 samples referring to the revised Bloom's Taxonomy and conductthousands of human and LLM evaluations. Results show that human and LLM judgesare vulnerable to perturbations to various degrees, and that even the mostcutting-edge judges possess considerable biases. We further exploit theirweakness and conduct attacks on LLM judges. We hope that our work can notifythe community of the vulnerability of human- and LLM-as-a-judge againstperturbations, as well as the urgency of developing robust evaluation systems.</description><author>Guiming Hardy Chen, Shunian Chen, Ziche Liu, Feng Jiang, Benyou Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 17:00:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10669v2</guid></item><item><title>Neural Network Diffusion</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13144v1</link><description>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image and videogeneration.

The community tacitlystopped utilizing ELECTRA's sentence embeddings for semantic textual similarity(STS). We notice a significant drop in performance when using the ELECTRAdiscriminator's last layer in comparison to earlier layers. We explore thisdrop and devise a way to repair ELECTRA's embeddings, proposing a noveltruncated model fine-tuning (TMFT) method. TMFT improves the Spearmancorrelation coefficient by over 8 points while increasing parameter efficiencyon the STS benchmark dataset. We extend our analysis to various model sizes andlanguages. Further, we discover the surprising efficacy of ELECTRA's generatormodel, which performs on par with BERT, using significantly fewer parametersand a substantially smaller embedding size. Finally, we observe further boostsby combining TMFT with a word similarity task or domain adaptive pre-training.</description><author>Ivan Rep, David Dukić, Jan Šnajder</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 16:43:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13130v1</guid></item><item><title>VGMShield: Mitigating Misuse of Video Generative Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13126v1</link><description>With the rapid advancement in video generation, people can convenientlyutilize video generation models to create videos tailored to their specificdesires. Nevertheless, there are also growing concerns about their potentialmisuse in creating and disseminating false information. In this work, we introduce VGMShield: a set of three straightforward butpioneering mitigations through the lifecycle of fake video generation. We startfrom \textit{fake video detection} trying to understand whether there isuniqueness in generated videos and whether we can differentiate them from realvideos; then, we investigate the \textit{tracing} problem, which maps a fakevideo back to a model that generates it. Towards these, we propose to leveragepre-trained models that focus on {\it spatial-temporal dynamics} as thebackbone to identify inconsistencies in videos. Through experiments on sevenstate-of-the-art open-source models, we demonstrate that current models stillcannot perfectly handle spatial-temporal relationships, and thus, we canaccomplish detection and tracing with nearly perfect accuracy. Furthermore, anticipating future generative model improvements, we propose a{\it prevention} method that adds invisible perturbations to images to make thegenerated videos look unreal. Together with fake video detection and tracing,our multi-faceted set of solutions can effectively mitigate misuse of videogenerative models.</description><author>Yan Pang, Yang Zhang, Tianhao Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 16:39:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13126v1</guid></item><item><title>TreeEval: Benchmark-Free Evaluation of Large Language Models through Tree Planning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13125v1</link><description>Recently, numerous new benchmarks have been established to evaluate theperformance of large language models (LLMs) via either computing a holisticscore or employing another LLM as a judge.

To address this issue, we introduce $\textbf{TreeEval}$, abenchmark-free evaluation method for LLMs that let a high-performance LLM hostan irreproducible evaluation session and essentially avoids the data leakage.Moreover, this LLM performs as an examiner to raise up a series of questionsunder a topic with a tree planing strategy, which considers the currentevaluation status to decide the next question generation and ensures thecompleteness and efficiency of the evaluation process. We evaluate $6$ modelsof different parameter sizes, including $7$B, $13$B, and $33$B, and ultimatelyachieved the highest correlation coefficient with AlpacaEval2.0 using onlyaround $45$ questions.

In this paper, we investigatea more challenging setting in which a lightweight model has to be trained on atarget unlabelled dataset for semantic segmentation, under the assumption thatwe have access only to black-box source model predictions. Our method, namedCoRTe, consists of (i) a pseudo-labelling function that extracts reliableknowledge from the black-box source model using its relative confidence, (ii) apseudo label refinement method to retain and enhance the novel informationlearned by the student model on the target data, and (iii) a consistenttraining of the model using the extracted pseudo labels.

Previousresearch has shown that early stopping the training of the surrogate modelsubstantially increases transferability. A common hypothesis to explain this isthat deep neural networks (DNNs) first learn robust features, which are moregeneric, thus a better surrogate. Then, at later epochs, DNNs learn non-robustfeatures, which are more brittle, hence worst surrogate. First, we tend torefute this hypothesis, using transferability as a proxy for representationsimilarity. We then establish links between transferability and the explorationof the loss landscape in parameter space, focusing on sharpness, which isaffected by early stopping. This leads us to evaluate surrogate models trainedwith seven minimizers that minimize both loss value and loss sharpness. Amongthem, SAM consistently outperforms early stopping by up to 28.8 percentagepoints. We discover that the strong SAM regularization from large flatneighborhoods tightly links to transferability. Finally, the bestsharpness-aware minimizers prove competitive with other training methods andcomplement existing transferability techniques.</description><author>Martin Gubri, Maxime Cordy, Yves Le Traon</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 16:29:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02688v2</guid></item><item><title>INTERVENOR: Prompting the Coding Ability of Large Language Models with the Interactive Chain of Repair</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09868v4</link><description>This paper introduces INTERVENOR (INTERactiVE chaiN Of Repair), a systemdesigned to emulate the interactive code repair processes observed in humans,encompassing both code diagnosis and code repair. INTERVENOR prompts LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) to play distinct roles during the code repair process,functioning as both a Code Learner and a Code Teacher. Specifically, the CodeLearner is tasked with adhering to instructions to generate or repair code,while the Code Teacher is responsible for crafting a Chain-of-Repair (CoR) toserve as guidance for the Code Learner. During generating the CoR, the CodeLearner needs to check the generated codes from Code Learner and reassess howto address code bugs based on error feedback received from compilers.Experimental results demonstrate that INTERVENOR surpasses baseline models,exhibiting improvements of approximately 18% and 4.3% over GPT-3.5 in codegeneration and code translation tasks, respectively.

Synthetic data generation is one solution, producingartificial data that mirrors the statistical properties of private data. Whilenumerous techniques have been devised under differential privacy, theypredominantly assume data is centralized. However, data is often distributedacross multiple clients in a federated manner. In this work, we initiate thestudy of federated synthetic tabular data generation. Building upon a SOTAcentral method known as AIM, we present DistAIM and FLAIM. We first show thatit is straightforward to distribute AIM, extending a recent approach based onsecure multi-party computation which necessitates additional overhead, makingit less suited to federated scenarios. We then demonstrate that naivelyfederating AIM can lead to substantial degradation in utility under thepresence of heterogeneity. To mitigate both issues, we propose an augmentedFLAIM approach that maintains a private proxy of heterogeneity. We simulate ourmethods across a range of benchmark datasets under different degrees ofheterogeneity and show we can improve utility while reducing overhead.</description><author>Samuel Maddock, Graham Cormode, Carsten Maple</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 16:18:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03447v2</guid></item><item><title>A multimodal dynamical variational autoencoder for audiovisual speech representation learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03582v3</link><description>In this paper, we present a multimodal and dynamical VAE (MDVAE) applied tounsupervised audio-visual speech representation learning.

A static latentvariable is also introduced to encode the information that is constant overtime within an audiovisual speech sequence. The model is trained in anunsupervised manner on an audiovisual emotional speech dataset, in two stages.In the first stage, a vector quantized VAE (VQ-VAE) is learned independentlyfor each modality, without temporal modeling. The second stage consists inlearning the MDVAE model on the intermediate representation of the VQ-VAEsbefore quantization. The disentanglement between static versus dynamical andmodality-specific versus modality-common information occurs during this secondtraining stage. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate howaudiovisual speech latent factors are encoded in the latent space of MDVAE.These experiments include manipulating audiovisual speech, audiovisual facialimage denoising, and audiovisual speech emotion recognition. The results showthat MDVAE effectively combines the audio and visual information in its latentspace.

However,such direct manipulations may not be always realizable. In this paper, weconsider a multi-agent setting where a well-trained victim agent $\nu$ isexploited by an attacker controlling another agent $\alpha$ with an\textit{adversarial policy}. Previous models do not account for the possibilitythat the attacker may only have partial control over $\alpha$ or that theattack may produce easily detectable "abnormal" behaviors. Furthermore, thereis a lack of provably efficient defenses against these adversarial policies. Toaddress these limitations, we introduce a generalized attack framework that hasthe flexibility to model to what extent the adversary is able to control theagent, and allows the attacker to regulate the state distribution shift andproduce stealthier adversarial policies. Moreover, we offer a provablyefficient defense with polynomial convergence to the most robust victim policythrough adversarial training with timescale separation. This stands in sharpcontrast to supervised learning, where adversarial training typically providesonly \textit{empirical} defenses. Using the Robosumo competition experiments,we show that our generalized attack formulation results in much stealthieradversarial policies when maintaining the same winning rate as baselines.Additionally, our adversarial training approach yields stable learning dynamicsand less exploitable victim policies.</description><author>Xiangyu Liu, Souradip Chakraborty, Yanchao Sun, Furong Huang</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 16:05:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17342v3</guid></item><item><title>SemiReward: A General Reward Model for Semi-supervised Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03013v2</link><description>Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has witnessed great progress with variousimprovements in the self-training framework with pseudo labeling.

Yet, their effectiveness often diminishesin low-resource languages like Chinese, exacerbated by biased evaluations fromdata leakage, casting doubt on their true generalizability to new linguisticterritories. In response, we introduce the Chinese Instruction-FollowingBenchmark (CIF-Bench), designed to evaluate the zero-shot generalizability ofLLMs to the Chinese language. CIF-Bench comprises 150 tasks and 15,000input-output pairs, developed by native speakers to test complex reasoning andChinese cultural nuances across 20 categories. To mitigate evaluation bias, werelease only half of the dataset publicly, with the remainder kept private, andintroduce diversified instructions to minimize score variance, totaling 45,000data instances. Our evaluation of 28 selected LLMs reveals a noticeableperformance gap, with the best model scoring only 52.9%, highlighting thelimitations of LLMs in less familiar language and task contexts. This work aimsto uncover the current limitations of LLMs in handling Chinese tasks, pushingtowards the development of more culturally informed and linguistically diversemodels with the released data and benchmark(https://yizhilll.github.io/CIF-Bench/).</description><author>Yizhi LI, Ge Zhang, Xingwei Qu, Jiali Li, Zhaoqun Li, Zekun Wang, Hao Li, Ruibin Yuan, Yinghao Ma, Kai Zhang, Wangchunshu Zhou, Yiming Liang, Lei Zhang, Lei Ma, Jiajun Zhang, Zuowen Li, Stephen W.

Reasons forthe existence of EoS when training using gradient descent have recently beenproposed -- a lack of flat minima near the gradient descent trajectory togetherwith the presence of compact forward-invariant sets. In this paper, we showthat linear neural networks optimized under a quadratic loss function satisfythe first assumption and also a necessary condition for the second assumption.More precisely, we prove that the gradient descent map is non-singular, the setof global minimizers of the loss function forms a smooth manifold, and thestable minima form a bounded subset in parameter space. Additionally, we provethat if the step-size is too big, then the set of initializations from whichgradient descent converges to a critical point has measure zero.</description><author>Alexandru Crăciun, Debarghya Ghoshdastidar</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 16:01:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13108v1</guid></item><item><title>On Generalization Bounds for Deep Compound Gaussian Neural Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13106v1</link><description>Algorithm unfolding or unrolling is the technique of constructing a deepneural network (DNN) from an iterative algorithm. Unrolled DNNs often providebetter interpretability and superior empirical performance over standard DNNsin signal estimation tasks. An important theoretical question, which has onlyrecently received attention, is the development of generalization error boundsfor unrolled DNNs. These bounds deliver theoretical and practical insights intothe performance of a DNN on empirical datasets that are distinct from, butsampled from, the probability density generating the DNN training data. In thispaper, we develop novel generalization error bounds for a class of unrolledDNNs that are informed by a compound Gaussian prior. These compound Gaussiannetworks have been shown to outperform comparative standard and unfolded deepneural networks in compressive sensing and tomographic imaging problems. Thegeneralization error bound is formulated by bounding the Rademacher complexityof the class of compound Gaussian network estimates with Dudley's integral.Under realistic conditions, we show that, at worst, the generalization errorscales $\mathcal{O}(n\sqrt{\ln(n)})$ in the signal dimension and$\mathcal{O}(($Network Size$)^{3/2})$ in network size.</description><author>Carter Lyons, Raghu G.

However, in the age of large multivariate andincomplete data, statistical dependencies between features must be estimated ina computationally tractable way, while also dealing with missing data. There isa need for a computationally tractable approach that considers the statisticaldependencies between features and can handle missing values. We here develop amultivariate version of FLDA (MUDRA) to tackle this issue and describe anefficient expectation/conditional-maximization (ECM) algorithm to infer itsparameters. We assess its predictive power on the "Articulary Word Recognition"data set and show its improvement over the state-of-the-art, especially in thecase of missing data. MUDRA allows interpretable classification of data setswith large proportions of missing data, which will be particularly useful formedical or psychological data sets.</description><author>Rahul Bordoloi, Clémence Réda, Orell Trautmann, Saptarshi Bej, Olaf Wolkenhauer</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 15:58:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13103v1</guid></item><item><title>A Microstructure-based Graph Neural Network for Accelerating Multiscale Simulations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13101v1</link><description>Simulating the mechanical response of advanced materials can be done moreaccurately using concurrent multiscale models than with single-scalesimulations. However, the computational costs stand in the way of the practicalapplication of this approach. The costs originate from microscale FiniteElement (FE) models that must be solved at every macroscopic integration point.A plethora of surrogate modeling strategies attempt to alleviate this cost bylearning to predict macroscopic stresses from macroscopic strains, completelyreplacing the microscale models. In this work, we introduce an alternativesurrogate modeling strategy that allows for keeping the multiscale nature ofthe problem, allowing it to be used interchangeably with an FE solver for anytime step. Our surrogate provides all microscopic quantities, which are thenhomogenized to obtain macroscopic quantities of interest. We achieve this foran elasto-plastic material by predicting full-field microscopic strains using agraph neural network (GNN) while retaining the microscopic constitutivematerial model to obtain the stresses. This hybrid data-physics graph-basedapproach avoids the high dimensionality originating from predicting full-fieldresponses while allowing non-locality to arise. By training the GNN on avariety of meshes, it learns to generalize to unseen meshes, allowing a singlemodel to be used for a range of microstructures. The embedded microscopicconstitutive model in the GNN implicitly tracks history-dependent variables andleads to improved accuracy. We demonstrate for several challenging scenariosthat the surrogate can predict complex macroscopic stress-strain paths. As thecomputation time of our method scales favorably with the number of elements inthe microstructure compared to the FE method, our method can significantlyaccelerate FE2 simulations.</description><author>J.

Traditional distillation methods, which transfer the capabilitiesof LLMs to smaller models, often fail to determine whether the knowledge hasbeen sufficiently transferred, potentially resulting in high costs orincomplete distillation. In this paper, we propose an Explanation-Guided LLMsActive Distillation (ELAD) framework that employs an active learning strategyto optimize the balance between annotation costs and model performance. Toimprove efficient sample selection, we introduce an explanation-guided sampleselection method that identifies samples challenging its reasoning byexploiting uncertainties in explanation steps. Additionally, we present acustomized LLM-annotated explanation revision technique where the teacher modeldetects and corrects flaws in the student model's reasoning. Our experimentsacross various reasoning datasets demonstrate that our framework significantlyenhances the efficiency of LLM knowledge distillation.</description><author>Yifei Zhang, Bo Pan, Chen Ling, Yuntong Hu, Liang Zhao</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 15:47:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13098v1</guid></item><item><title>Exact Hard Monotonic Attention for Character-Level Transduction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06319v3</link><description>Many common character-level, string-to string transduction tasks, e.g.,grapheme-tophoneme conversion and morphological inflection, consist almostexclusively of monotonic transductions. However, neural sequence-to sequencemodels that use non-monotonic soft attention often outperform popular monotonicmodels. In this work, we ask the following question: Is monotonicity really ahelpful inductive bias for these tasks? We develop a hard attentionsequence-to-sequence model that enforces strict monotonicity and learns alatent alignment jointly while learning to transduce. With the help of dynamicprogramming, we are able to compute the exact marginalization over allmonotonic alignments. Our models achieve state-of-the-art performance onmorphological inflection. Furthermore, we find strong performance on two othercharacter-level transduction tasks.

Inspired by John Rawls's advocacyfor pure procedural justice, we view automated decision-making as a microcosmof social institutions, and consider how the data generating process itself cansatisfy the requirements of procedural fairness. We propose a framework thatdecouples the objectionable data generating components from the neutral ones byutilizing reference points and the associated value instantiation rule.

Existing work edits LLMs at the levelof factual knowledge triplets. However, natural knowledge updates in the realworld come from the occurrences of new events rather than direct changes infactual triplets. In this paper, we propose a new task setting: event-levelknowledge editing, which directly edits new events into LLMs and improves overconventional triplet-level editing on (1) Efficiency. A single event edit leadsto updates in multiple entailed knowledge triplets. (2) Completeness. Beyondupdating factual knowledge, event-level editing also requires considering theevent influences and updating LLMs' knowledge about future trends. We constructa high-quality event-level editing benchmark ELKEN, consisting of 1,515 eventedits, 6,449 questions about factual knowledge, and 10,150 questions aboutfuture tendencies. We systematically evaluate the performance of variousknowledge editing methods and LLMs on this benchmark. We find that ELKEN posessignificant challenges to existing knowledge editing approaches.

In this paper, we show that MMD flows with Rieszkernels $K(x,y) = - \|x-y\|^r$, $r \in (0,2)$ have exceptional properties whichallow their efficient computation. We prove that the MMD of Riesz kernels,which is also known as energy distance, coincides with the MMD of their slicedversion. As a consequence, the computation of gradients of MMDs can beperformed in the one-dimensional setting. Here, for $r=1$, a simple sortingalgorithm can be applied to reduce the complexity from $O(MN+N^2)$ to$O((M+N)\log(M+N))$ for two measures with $M$ and $N$ support points. Asanother interesting follow-up result, the MMD of compactly supported measurescan be estimated from above and below by the Wasserstein-1 distance. For theimplementations we approximate the gradient of the sliced MMD by using only afinite number $P$ of slices. We show that the resulting error has complexity$O(\sqrt{d/P})$, where $d$ is the data dimension. These results enable us totrain generative models by approximating MMD gradient flows by neural networkseven for image applications. We demonstrate the efficiency of our model byimage generation on MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR10.</description><author>Johannes Hertrich, Christian Wald, Fabian Altekrüger, Paul Hagemann</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 15:35:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11463v4</guid></item><item><title>LARA: A Light and Anti-overfitting Retraining Approach for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05668v3</link><description>Most of current anomaly detection models assume that the normal patternremains same all the time. However, the normal patterns of Web services changedramatically and frequently. The model trained on old-distribution data isoutdated after such changes. Retraining the whole model every time isexpensive. Besides, at the beginning of normal pattern changes, there is notenough observation data from the new distribution. Retraining a large neuralnetwork model with limited data is vulnerable to overfitting. Thus, we proposea Light and Anti-overfitting Retraining Approach (LARA) for deep variationalauto-encoder based time series anomaly detection methods (VAEs). This work aimsto make three novel contributions: 1) the retraining process is formulated as aconvex problem and can converge at a fast rate as well as prevent overfitting;2) designing a ruminate block, which leverages the historical data without theneed to store them; 3) mathematically proving that when fine-tuning the latentvector and reconstructed data, the linear formations can achieve the leastadjusting errors between the ground truths and the fine-tuned ones. Moreover, we have performed many experiments to verify that retraining LARAwith even 43 time slots of data from new distribution can result in itscompetitive F1 Score in comparison with the state-of-the-art anomaly detectionmodels trained with sufficient data. Besides, we verify its light overhead.</description><author>Feiyi Chen, Zhen Qin, Yingying Zhang, Shuiguang Deng, Yi Xiao, Guansong Pang, Qingsong Wen</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 15:33:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05668v3</guid></item><item><title>Towards an empirical understanding of MoE design choices</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13089v1</link><description>In this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of common design choicesin Mixture of Experts (MoEs) on validation performance, uncovering distinctinfluences at token and sequence levels.

We construct a newoptimization scheme called relaxed approximate proximal point (RAPP), which isthe first explicit method without anchoring to achieve last iterate convergencerates for $\rho$-comonotone problems while only requiring $\rho &gt;-\tfrac{1}{2L}$. The construction extends to constrained and regularizedsettings.

A pivotalchallenge is the development of an efficient method to encapsulate videocontent into a set of representative tokens to align with LLMs. In this work,we introduce Slot-VLM, a novel framework designed to generate semanticallydecomposed video tokens, in terms of object-wise and event-wise visualrepresentations, to facilitate LLM inference. Particularly, we design aSlowFast Slots module, i.e., SF-Slots, that adaptively aggregates the densevideo tokens from the CLIP vision encoder to a set of representative slots. Inorder to take into account both the spatial object details and the variedtemporal dynamics, SF-Slots is built with a dual-branch structure. TheSlow-Slots branch focuses on extracting object-centric slots from features athigh spatial resolution but low (slow) frame sample rate, emphasizing detailedobject information. Conversely, Fast-Slots branch is engineered to learnevent-centric slots from high temporal sample rate but low spatial resolutionfeatures. These complementary slots are combined to form the vision context,serving as the input to the LLM for efficient question answering.

Unlike many private algorithms,including the prevalent DP-SGD, the privacy implications of tuning remaininsufficiently understood. Recent works propose a generic private solution forthe tuning process, yet a fundamental question still persists: is the currentprivacy bound for this solution tight? This paper contributes both positive and negative answers to this question.Initially, we provide studies affirming the current privacy analysis is indeedtight in a general sense. However, when we specifically study thehyper-parameter tuning problem, such tightness no longer holds. This is firstdemonstrated by applying privacy audit on the tuning process. Our findingsunderscore a substantial gap between the current theoretical privacy bound andthe empirical bound derived even under the strongest audit setup. The gap found is not a fluke. Our subsequent study provides an improvedprivacy result for private hyper-parameter tuning due to its distinctproperties. Our privacy results are also more generalizable compared to prioranalyses that are only easily applicable in specific setups.</description><author>Zihang Xiang, Chenglong Wang, Di Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 15:29:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13087v1</guid></item><item><title>Generalizable Chain-of-Thought Prompting in Mixed-task Scenarios with Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06692v3</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have unveiled remarkable reasoning capabilitiesby exploiting chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which generates intermediatereasoning chains to serve as the rationale for deriving the answer.
