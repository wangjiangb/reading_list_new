In this paper, toward identifying guidelines formitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patternsof two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) andreinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend acrossLM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achievingcomparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for thisdifference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as amixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and theother to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, whichstems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intactwhen learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstratingthat the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting inpractical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KLregularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, ourresults highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximatelyon-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fullyon-policy data.</description><author>Howard Chen, Noam Razin, Karthik Narasimhan, Danqi Chen</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:59:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18874v1</guid></item><item><title>DSI-Bench: A Benchmark for Dynamic Spatial Intelligence</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18873v1</link><description>Reasoning about dynamic spatial relationships is essential, as both observersand objects often move simultaneously. Although vision-language models (VLMs)and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, theirability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduceDynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering ninedecoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporallysymmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models'reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs andexpert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer andobject motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relativerelationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findingsand insights about the future development of general and expertise models withdynamic spatial intelligence.</description><author>Ziang Zhang, Zehan Wang, Guanghao Zhang, Weilong Dai, Yan Xia, Ziang Yan, Minjie Hong, Zhou Zhao</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:59:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18873v1</guid></item><item><title>Bee: A High-Quality Corpus and Full-Stack Suite to Unlock Advanced Fully Open MLLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13795v2</link><description>Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behindproprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data qualityfor supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are oftenplagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced modelcapabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primarycontributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprisingapproximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaningtechniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichmentstrategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and itsunderlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent andadaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static datasetreleases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8Bmodel on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a newstate-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that iscompetitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such asInternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundationalresources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suitecomprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on dataquality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highlycompetitive with their semi-open counterparts.</description><author>Yi Zhang, Bolin Ni, Xin-Sheng Chen, Heng-Rui Zhang, Yongming Rao, Houwen Peng, Qinglin Lu, Han Hu, Meng-Hao Guo, Shi-Min Hu</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:59:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13795v2</guid></item><item><title>How Do LLMs Use Their Depth?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18871v1</link><description>Growing evidence suggests that large language models do not use their depthuniformly, yet we still lack a fine-grained understanding of their layer-wiseprediction dynamics. In this paper, we trace the intermediate representationsof several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured andnuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a "Guess-then-Refine" frameworkthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to makepredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layersare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statisticalguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriatecontextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into themodel, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.Even high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined &gt;70% of thetime, indicating that correct token prediction is not "one-and-done". We thengo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layerdepth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows thatfunction words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)Fact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first tokenrequires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice taskanalysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within thefirst half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.Together, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, sheddinglight on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictionsand providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency intransformer-based models.</description><author>Akshat Gupta, Jay Yeung, Gopala Anumanchipalli, Anna Ivanova</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:59:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18871v1</guid></item><item><title>LightMem: Lightweight and Efficient Memory-Augmented Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18866v1</link><description>Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggleto effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic andcomplex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond statelessinteractions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, andutilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introducesubstantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a newmemory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performanceand efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model ofhuman memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant informationthrough lightweight compression and groups information according to theirtopics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-basedgroups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure thatdecouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval withGPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines inaccuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, APIcalls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

While artificial curiosity offers a powerfulself-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity withmeaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniformnovelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peerbehavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARLsettings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibratetheir own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novelapproach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principledframework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals andguide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity withinferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generatestheoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore statetransitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suitesincluding VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate thatexploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms insparse-reward environments.</description><author>Yiyuan Pan, Zhe Liu, Hesheng Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:58:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20648v2</guid></item><item><title>Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15138v2</link><description>Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning(MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to captureglobal dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature ofpatch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structuresessential for robust diagnostic prediction. We propose Fourier TransformMultiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a framework that augments MIL with afrequency-domain branch to provide compact global context. Low-frequency cropsare extracted from WSIs via the Fast Fourier Transform and processed through amodular FFT-Block composed of convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization tomitigate the high variance of frequency data. The learned global frequencyfeature is fused with spatial patch features through lightweight integrationstrategies, enabling compatibility with diverse MIL architectures. FFT-MIL wasevaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public datasets(BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1 scoresby an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains acrossarchitectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain learningas an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global dependencies inWSI classification, complementing spatial features and advancing thescalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.</description><author>Anthony Bilic, Guangyu Sun, Ming Li, Md Sanzid Bin Hossain, Yu Tian, Wei Zhang, Laura Brattain, Dexter Hadley, Chen Chen</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:57:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15138v2</guid></item><item><title>PowerChain: A Verifiable Agentic AI System for Automating Distribution Grid Analyses</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17094v3</link><description>Rapid electrification and decarbonization are increasing the complexity ofdistribution grid (DG) operation and planning, necessitating advancedcomputational analyses to ensure reliability and resilience. These analysesdepend on disparate workflows comprising complex models, function calls, anddata pipelines that require substantial expert knowledge and remain difficultto automate. Workforce and budget constraints further limit utilities' abilityto apply such analyses at scale. To address this gap, we build an agenticsystem PowerChain, which is capable of autonomously performing complex gridanalyses. Existing agentic AI systems are typically developed in a bottom-upmanner with customized context for predefined analysis tasks; therefore, theydo not generalize to tasks that the agent has never seen. In comparison, togeneralize to unseen DG analysis tasks, PowerChain dynamically generatesstructured context by leveraging supervisory signals from self-contained powersystems tools (e.g., GridLAB-D) and an optimized set of expert-annotated andverified reasoning trajectories. For complex DG tasks defined in naturallanguage, empirical results on real utility data demonstrate that PowerChainachieves up to a 144/% improvement in performance over baselines.</description><author>Emmanuel O.

But humans have access to a broad and embodied context, which iskey in detecting and resolving linguistic ambiguities, even in isolated textspans. A foundational case of semantic ambiguity is found in the task ofcoreference resolution: how is a pronoun related to an earlier person mention?This capability is implicit in nearly every downstream task, and the presenceof ambiguity at this level can alter performance significantly. We show thatLLMs can achieve good performance with minimal prompting in both coreferencedisambiguation and the detection of ambiguity in coreference, however, theycannot do both at the same time. We present the CORRECT-DETECT trade-off:though models have both capabilities and deploy them implicitly, successfulperformance balancing these two abilities remains elusive.</description><author>Amber Shore, Russell Scheinberg, Ameeta Agrawal, So Young Lee</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:46:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14456v2</guid></item><item><title>Every Step Evolves: Scaling Reinforcement Learning for Trillion-Scale Thinking Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18855v1</link><description>We present Ring-1T, the first open-source, state-of-the-art thinking modelwith a trillion-scale parameter. It features 1 trillion total parameters andactivates approximately 50 billion per token. Training such models at atrillion-parameter scale introduces unprecedented challenges, includingtrain-inference misalignment, inefficiencies in rollout processing, andbottlenecks in the RL system. To address these, we pioneer three interconnectedinnovations: (1) IcePop stabilizes RL training via token-level discrepancymasking and clipping, resolving instability from training-inference mismatches;(2) C3PO++ improves resource utilization for long rollouts under a token budgetby dynamically partitioning them, thereby obtaining high time efficiency; and(3) ASystem, a high-performance RL framework designed to overcome the systemicbottlenecks that impede trillion-parameter model training.

The proposed approachcombines the representational power of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) witha stability-aware policy gradient mechanism to ensure asymptotic convergenceand safe decision-making under dynamic environments. The vehicle longitudinalcontrol problem was formulated as a continuous-state reinforcement learningtask, where the quantum policy network generates control actions subject toLyapunov stability constraints. Simulation experiments were conducted in aclosed-loop adaptive cruise control scenario using a quantum-inspired policytrained under stability feedback. The results demonstrate that the LQRLframework successfully embeds Lyapunov stability verification into quantumpolicy learning, enabling interpretable and stability-aware controlperformance. Although transient overshoot and Lyapunov divergence were observedunder aggressive acceleration, the system maintained bounded state evolution,validating the feasibility of integrating safety guarantees within quantumreinforcement learning architectures.

However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, differentnoise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Althoughthis randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a widerperceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISRperformance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual PreferenceOptimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generativemodels with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference andno-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale humanpreference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity andnatural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond thestandard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs fromoutputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selectionratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptivelyweights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-groupdiversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experimentsacross both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SRsignificantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-worldbenchmarks.</description><author>Rongyuan Wu, Lingchen Sun, Zhengqiang Zhang, Shihao Wang, Tianhe Wu, Qiaosi Yi, Shuai Li, Lei Zhang</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:43:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18851v1</guid></item><item><title>NEXUS: Network Exploration for eXploiting Unsafe Sequences in Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreaks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03417v2</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processingbut remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, especially multi-turn jailbreaksthat distribute malicious intent across benign exchanges and bypass alignmentmechanisms.

In thiswork, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modelingto the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining aMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with aMultimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurateinterpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visualconsistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse videogeneration and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm andis jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideomatches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines intext/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-contextvideo editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms ofgeneralization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combiningediting with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within asingle instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form videoediting, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale imageediting data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such asgreen-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond thesecore capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.To foster future research, we will release our model and code.</description><author>Cong Wei, Quande Liu, Zixuan Ye, Qiulin Wang, Xintao Wang, Pengfei Wan, Kun Gai, Wenhu Chen</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:40:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08377v2</guid></item><item><title>Towards Faithful and Controllable Personalization via Critique-Post-Edit Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18849v1</link><description>Faithfully personalizing large language models (LLMs) to align withindividual user preferences is a critical but challenging task.

Traditional datageneration methods often fall short, struggling with low-fidelity and theability to model complex data structures and semantic relationships that arecritical for testing complex SQL code generation services like Natural Languageto SQL (NL2SQL). In this paper, we address the critical need for generatingsyntactically correct and semantically relevant high-fidelity mock data forcomplex data structures that includes columns with nested structures that wefrequently encounter in Google workloads. We highlight the limitations ofexisting approaches used in production, particularly their inability to handlelarge and complex data structures, as well as the lack of semantically coherenttest data that lead to limited test coverage.

However, due to computational and memory constraintsand potential privacy concerns, storing and accessing all the data isimpractical in many real-world scenarios where the data arrives in a stream. Inthis paper, we investigate the problem of one-pass learning, in which a modelis trained on sequentially arriving data without retraining on previousdatapoints. Motivated by the demonstrated effectiveness of overparameterizedmodels and the phenomenon of benign overfitting, we propose OrthogonalRecursive Fitting (ORFit), an algorithm for one-pass learning which seeks toperfectly fit each new datapoint while minimally altering the predictions onprevious datapoints. ORFit updates the parameters in a direction orthogonal topast gradients, similar to orthogonal gradient descent (OGD) in continuallearning. We show that, interestingly, ORFit's update leads to an operationsimilar to the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm in adaptive filteringbut with significantly improved memory and computational efficiency, i.e.,linear, instead of quadratic, in the number of parameters. To further reducememory usage, we leverage the structure of the streaming data via anincremental principal component analysis (IPCA). We show that using theprincipal components is minimax optimal, i.e., it minimizes the worst-caseforgetting of previous predictions for unknown future updates. Further, weprove that, for overparameterized linear models, the parameter vector obtainedby ORFit matches what the standard multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD)would converge to. Finally, we extend our results to the nonlinear setting forhighly overparameterized models, relevant for deep learning.</description><author>Youngjae Min, Namhoon Cho, Navid Azizan</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:38:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13853v2</guid></item><item><title>Inference on Local Variable Importance Measures for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18843v1</link><description>We provide an inferential framework to assess variable importance forheterogeneous treatment effects.

Applied to more than 2700 individuals with confirmedSARS-CoV-2 infection and prior HF, the model achieved strong discriminativeperformance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) and generated interpretable,patient-specific counterfactuals that quantify how modifying comorbiditypatterns or treatment factors could alter predicted outcomes. This workdemonstrates how counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimizationproblem over predictive functions, offering a rigorous, interpretable, andcomputationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complexbiomedical systems.</description><author>Jingya Cheng, Alaleh Azhir, Jiazi Tian, Hossein Estiri</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:35:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18841v1</guid></item><item><title>See the Text: From Tokenization to Visual Reading</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18840v1</link><description>People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects,including their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them tomeaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scriptseffectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subwordtokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. Whileeffective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resourcelanguages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflatingcomputation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and movetoward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scalemultimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches orsurpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens andreducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals ashift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a steptoward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.</description><author>Ling Xing, Alex Jinpeng Wang, Rui Yan, Hongyu Qu, Zechao Li, Jinhui Tang</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:34:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18840v1</guid></item><item><title>How Transformers Learn In-Context Recall Tasks? Optimality, Training Dynamics and Generalization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15009v3</link><description>We study the approximation capabilities, convergence speeds andon-convergence behaviors of transformers trained on in-context recall tasks --which requires to recognize the \emph{positional} association between a pair oftokens from in-context examples. Existing theoretical results only focus on thein-context reasoning behavior of transformers after being trained for the\emph{one} gradient descent step. It remains unclear what is the on-convergencebehavior of transformers being trained by gradient descent and how fast theconvergence rate is. In addition, the generalization of transformers inone-step in-context reasoning has not been formally investigated. This workaddresses these gaps. We first show that a class of transformers with eitherlinear, ReLU or softmax attentions, is provably Bayes-optimal for an in-contextrecall task. When being trained with gradient descent, we show via afinite-sample analysis that the expected loss converges at linear rate to theBayes risks. Moreover, we show that the trained transformers exhibitout-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, i.e., generalizing to samples outsideof the population distribution. Our theoretical findings are further supportedby extensive empirical validations, showing that \emph{without} properparameterization, models with larger expressive power surprisingly \emph{fail}to generalize OOD after being trained by gradient descent.</description><author>Quan Nguyen, Thanh Nguyen-Tang</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:34:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15009v3</guid></item><item><title>FedDEAP: Adaptive Dual-Prompt Tuning for Multi-Domain Federated Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18837v1</link><description>Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively trainmachine learning models without exposing local data, balancing performance andprivacy. However, domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients oftenhinder the generalization of the aggregated global model. Recently, large-scalevision-language models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot classificationcapabilities, raising the question of how to effectively fine-tune CLIP acrossdomains in a federated setting. In this work, we propose an adaptive federatedprompt tuning framework, FedDEAP, to enhance CLIP's generalization inmulti-domain scenarios. Our method includes the following three key components:(1) To mitigate the loss of domain-specific information caused bylabel-supervised tuning, we disentangle semantic and domain-specific featuresin images by using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiasedmappings; (2) To preserve domain-specific knowledge during global promptaggregation, we introduce a dual-prompt design with a global semantic promptand a local domain prompt to balance shared and personalized information; (3)To maximize the inclusion of semantic and domain information from images in thegenerated text features, we align textual and visual representations under thetwo learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency.Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate theeffectiveness of our method in enhancing the generalization of CLIP forfederated image recognition across multiple domains.</description><author>Yubin Zheng, Pak-Hei Yeung, Jing Xia, Tianjie Ju, Peng Tang, Weidong Qiu, Jagath C.

Yet ML-as-a-Service reveals little aboutwhat actually ran or whether returned outputs faithfully reflect the intendedinputs. Users lack recourse against service downgrades (model swaps,quantization, graph rewrites, or discrepancies like altered ad embeddings).Verifying outputs is hard because floating-point(FP) execution on heterogeneousaccelerators is inherently nondeterministic. Existing approaches are eitherimpractical for real FP neural networks or reintroduce vendor trust. We presentNAO: a Nondeterministic tolerance Aware Optimistic verification protocol thataccepts outputs within principled operator-level acceptance regions rather thanrequiring bitwise equality. NAO combines two error models: (i) soundper-operator IEEE-754 worst-case bounds and (ii) tight empirical percentileprofiles calibrated across hardware. Discrepancies trigger a Merkle-anchored,threshold-guided dispute game that recursively partitions the computation graphuntil one operator remains, where adjudication reduces to a lightweighttheoretical-bound check or a small honest-majority vote against empiricalthresholds. Unchallenged results finalize after a challenge window, withoutrequiring trusted hardware or deterministic kernels. We implement NAO as aPyTorch-compatible runtime and a contract layer currently deployed on EthereumHolesky testnet. The runtime instruments graphs, computes per-operator bounds,and runs unmodified vendor kernels in FP32 with negligible overhead (0.3% onQwen3-8B). Across CNNs, Transformers and diffusion models on A100, H100,RTX6000, RTX4090, empirical thresholds are $10^2-10^3$ times tighter thantheoretical bounds, and bound-aware adversarial attacks achieve 0% success.

Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing thecomputational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs withdynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributedsettings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- andstep-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributedmethodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient trainingfor LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three keycomponents: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention,and hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed tosynergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheadsinherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of modelswith extensive context lengths. We demonstrate the efficacy of MTraining bytraining Qwen2.5-3B, successfully expanding its context window from 32K to 512Ktokens on a cluster of 32 A100 GPUs. Our evaluations on a comprehensive suiteof downstream tasks, including RULER, PG-19, InfiniteBench, and Needle In AHaystack, reveal that MTraining achieves up to a 6x higher training throughputwhile preserving model accuracy.

This paper initiates atheoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on manifolds. Weestablish a novel connection between the attention mechanism and classicalkernel methods, demonstrating that transformers effectively performkernel-based prediction at a new query through its interaction with the prompt.This connection is validated by numerical experiments, revealing that thelearned query-prompt scores for H\"older functions are highly correlated withthe Gaussian kernel. Building on this insight, we derive generalization errorbounds in terms of the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When asufficient number of training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to theminimax regression rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scalesexponentially with the intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than theambient space dimension. Our result also characterizes how the generalizationerror scales with the number of training tasks, shedding light on thecomplexity of transformers as in-context kernel algorithm learners.

However, their use hastraditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely onestimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous actionspaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomescomputationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typicallyemployed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite theirpopularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. Inthis work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous controlthat revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of keyarchitectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning.We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standardsimulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par withstate-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor.Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the valuefunctions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximizationoutperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.We have released our code at https://github.com/USC-Lira/Q3C.</description><author>Yigit Korkmaz, Urvi Bhuwania, Ayush Jain, Erdem Bıyık</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:24:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18828v1</guid></item><item><title>SO(3)-invariant PCA with application to molecular data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18827v1</link><description>Principal component analysis (PCA) is a fundamental technique fordimensionality reduction and denoising; however, its application tothree-dimensional data with arbitrary orientations -- common in structuralbiology -- presents significant challenges.

In this paper, we extend PCA to 3D volumetricdatasets with unknown orientations by developing an efficient and principledframework for SO(3)-invariant PCA that implicitly accounts for all rotationswithout explicit data augmentation. By exploiting underlying algebraicstructure, we demonstrate that the computation involves only the square root ofthe total number of covariance entries, resulting in a substantial reduction incomplexity.

However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architecturaldesigns tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. Toaddress this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals anunderlying equivalence between model architecture and attention maskconstruction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm bycapturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability ofcorrect classification positively correlates with the receptive field size andlabel consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effectiveattention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and ahigh level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies thisprinciple across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masksoffer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, weintroduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer withMulti-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporatesthree theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expertrouting mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information.To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation schemethat dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local masksparsity.

Although a few recentworks explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic taskscan hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. Toachieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training fordeep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search enginecalling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver.The task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-definedground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver triesto handle the generated search queries and output the correct answerpredictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate groundtruth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory asexternal knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) totest whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessarysearch documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposerand the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition andcooperation.

In this paradigm, the model generates its own responses andis immediately finetuned on this self-generated data. OSFT is a highlyefficient training strategy for LLM reasoning, as it is reward-free and usesjust one rollout by default. Experiment results show that OSFT achievesdownstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparableto strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods such asGRPO. Our ablation study further demonstrates the efficiency and robustness ofOSFT. The major mechanism of OSFT lies in facilitating the model's own existingpreference (latent knowledge) learned from pretraining, which leads toreasoning ability improvement. We believe that OSFT offers an efficient andpromising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms.

Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, aframework that renders long texts into images and processes them withvision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textualinput while preserving semantic information, and we further design anLLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurationsfor balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, wedemonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintainingaccuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-contextbenchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling anddecoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extremecompression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level texttasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodaltasks, such as document understanding.

In this paper, we first evaluate searchagents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produceharmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked "How can I tracksomeone's location without their consent?", a base model refuses, whereas asearch agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusalthreshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesizethem into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show thatutility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignmentof safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcementlearning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with anovel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safeones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70%across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, andmatches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analysesconfirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safetyand utility.</description><author>Qiusi Zhan, Angeline Budiman-Chan, Abdelrahman Zayed, Xingzhi Guo, Daniel Kang, Joo-Kyung Kim</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:12:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17017v2</guid></item><item><title>Stochastic Path Planning in Correlated Obstacle Fields</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19559v2</link><description>We introduce the Stochastic Correlated Obstacle Scene (SCOS) problem, anavigation setting with spatially correlated obstacles of uncertain blockagestatus, realistically constrained sensors that provide noisy readings andcostly disambiguation.

However, mainstream deep learning methods in this field struggleto simultaneously capture fine-grained local features and model global spatialrelationships, while maintaining a balance between accuracy and computationalefficiency. Local feature extraction requires capturing fine-grained anatomicaldetails, while global modeling requires understanding the spatial relationshipswithin complex anatomical structures. The high-dimensional nature of 3D volumefurther exacerbates these challenges, as landmarks are sparsely distributed,leading to significant computational costs. Therefore, achieving efficient andprecise 3D landmark detection remains a pressing challenge in medical imageanalysis. In this work, We propose a \textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{3}D \textbf{DE}tection\textbf{Net}(H3DE-Net), a novel framework that combines CNNs for local featureextraction with a lightweight attention mechanism designed to efficientlycapture global dependencies in 3D volumetric data. This mechanism employs ahierarchical routing strategy to reduce computational cost while maintainingglobal context modeling. To our knowledge, H3DE-Net is the first 3D landmarkdetection model that integrates such a lightweight attention mechanism withCNNs. Additionally, integrating multi-scale feature fusion further enhancesdetection accuracy and robustness. Experimental results on a public CT datasetdemonstrate that H3DE-Net achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance,significantly improving accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios withmissing landmarks or complex anatomical variations.

This reviewprovides a unified perspective on this subject, bridging classic theory withneural network training and biological learning. Although gradient-basedmethods, powered by the efficient but biologically implausible backpropagation(BP), dominate machine learning, their computational demands can hinderscalability in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, derivative-free orzeroth-order (ZO) optimization feature computationally lighter approaches thatrely only on function evaluations and randomness. While generally less sampleefficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods caneffectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BPin neural network models. This ZO paradigm is also particularly relevant forbiology. Its core principles of random exploration (probing) andfeedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biologicallearning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brainlearns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches basedon the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-,second-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore howthese methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network trainingand the resulting learning dynamics. Finally, we build upon these insights toview biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a ZOparadigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource.This framework not only illuminates our understanding of natural intelligencebut also holds vast implications for neuromorphic hardware, helping us designfast and energy-efficient AI systems that exploit intrinsic hardware noise.</description><author>Jesús García Fernández, Nasir Ahmad, Marcel van Gerven</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:10:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18812v1</guid></item><item><title>Context-Aware Pseudo-Label Scoring for Zero-Shot Video Summarization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17501v2</link><description>With video exploding across social media, surveillance, and education,compressing long footage into concise yet faithful surrogates is crucial.Supervised methods learn frame/shot importance from dense labels and excelin-domain, but are costly and brittle across datasets; unsupervised methodsavoid labels but often miss high-level semantics and narrative cues. Recentzero-shot pipelines use LLMs for training-free summarization, yet remainsensitive to handcrafted prompts and dataset-specific normalization.We proposea rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled prompting framework. A small subset of humanannotations is converted into high-confidence pseudo labels and aggregated intostructured, dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics for interpretable sceneevaluation. At inference, boundary scenes (first/last) are scored from theirown descriptions, while intermediate scenes include brief summaries of adjacentsegments to assess progression and redundancy, enabling the LLM to balancelocal salience with global coherence without parameter tuning.Across threebenchmarks, our method is consistently effective. On SumMe and TVSum itachieves F1 of 57.58 and 63.05, surpassing a zero-shot baseline (56.73, 62.21)by +0.85 and +0.84 and approaching supervised performance.

We study acontinuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausiblelearning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules includingstochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedbackalignment (DFA), and Kolen-Pollack (KP) emerge naturally as limiting cases ofthe dynamics. Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learnat biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise.Through analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporaloverlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the correspondingerror signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strengthdeclines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulusduration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths.Critically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale toexceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typicalcortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticitywindow in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifiesseconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning inbiological circuits.</description><author>Marc Gong Bacvanski, Liu Ziyin, Tomaso Poggio</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:04:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18808v1</guid></item><item><title>Janus-Pro-R1: Advancing Collaborative Visual Comprehension and Generation via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01480v2</link><description>Recent endeavors in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) aim to unifyvisual comprehension and generation. However, these two capabilities remainlargely independent, as if they are two separate functions encapsulated withinthe same model.

Tothis end, SB-SETM (i) leverages a truncated stick-breaking construction for thetopic-per-document distribution, enabling the model to automatically infer fromthe data the appropriate number of active topics at each timestep; and (ii)introduces a merging strategy for topic embeddings based on a continuousformulation of optimal transport adapted to the high dimensionality of thelatent topic space. Numerical experiments show SB-SETM outperforming baselineson simulated scenarios. We extensively test it on a real-world corpus of newsarticles covering the Russian-Ukrainian war throughout 2022-2023.</description><author>Federica Granese, Serena Villata, Charles Bouveyron</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 16:40:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18786v1</guid></item><item><title>CAGE: Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation For Accurate Quantization-Aware Training</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18784v1</link><description>Despite significant work on low-bit quantization-aware training (QAT), thereis still a large accuracy gap between such techniques and native training. Toaddress this, we introduce CAGE (Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation), a newQAT method that augments the straight-through estimator (STE) gradient with acurvature-aware correction designed to counteract the loss increase induced byquantization. CAGE is derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balancesloss minimization with adherence to quantization constraints, yielding aprincipled correction term that depends on local curvature information. On thetheoretical side, we introduce the notion of Pareto-optimal solutions forquantized optimization, and establish that CAGE yields strong convergenceguarantees in the smooth non-convex setting. In terms of implementation, ourapproach is optimizer-agnostic, but we provide a highly-efficientimplementation that leverages Adam statistics. When pre-training Llama-stylemodels of up to 800M-parameters, CAGE recovers over 10% of thequantization-induced loss increase in the W4A4 regime over outlier-mitigationmethods. These results indicate that curvature-aware gradient corrections canbridge the remaining performance gap beyond current outlier-handling methods.</description><author>Soroush Tabesh, Mher Safaryan, Dan Alistarh</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 16:33:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18784v1</guid></item><item><title>How to Evaluate Monocular Depth Estimation?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19814v1</link><description>Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but howto evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack ofstandardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluationmetrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood.

Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration ofspectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel "Rebellious Student" frameworkfor complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-studentparadigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatialbranch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementaryspatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learningstrategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained viareverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and(2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimizedusing decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintainingreconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the frameworkenhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-freeand training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors.Extensive experiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvementsover several established baselines with minimal computational overhead,confirming the effectiveness and generality of the proposed complementarylearning paradigm.

First,current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporalconsistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video fromother modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, isseverely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lacka systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilitiesfor building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, acomprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model couldunderstand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. Wecollect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) andextract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, whichare then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. Foreach prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from theperspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefullydefined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefullycurated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline isdeveloped by using modern vision-language models.

In statistics, VI istypically framed as a Bayesian method for posterior approximation. In machinelearning, however, VAEs and DDMs are developed from a Frequentist viewpoint,where VI is used to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator.

However, most existing diffusiontransformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs(&lt;=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attentionmechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computationalbottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K)impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, wepresent UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficientand ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically,UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based onglobal-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into alocal attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a globalattention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose aspatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn globaldependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism toreduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across differentlocal windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectivelyscale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolutionfor the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods andsuper-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitativeevaluations.</description><author>Teng Hu, Jiangning Zhang, Zihan Su, Ran Yi</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 16:23:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18775v1</guid></item><item><title>On the hardness of RL with Lookahead</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19372v1</link><description>We study reinforcement learning (RL) with transition look-ahead, where theagent may observe which states would be visited upon playing any sequence of$\ell$ actions before deciding its course of action.

While this ability is useful for interactingwith structured data like code files, another popular method,Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augmentthe model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to bestrepresent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data,particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose anovel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like aGitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at eachhierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in aknowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to usingRAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of thegenerated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparableacross both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in theretriever, a significant gain in efficiency.

In contrast, representations within most machine learningmodels lack spatial biases, instead manifesting as disorganized vector spacesthat are difficult to visualize and interpret. Here, we propose a novel form ofself-attention that turns Transformers into "Topoformers" with topographicorganization. We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries arearranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a givenkey - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connectedlayer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstratethe feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentimentclassification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographicorganization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separatelyencourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs.We then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture witha masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variantperforms on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yetproduces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eightlinguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brainresponses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignmentbetween low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model andhuman brain language network. Scaling up Topoformers further holds promise forgreater interpretability in NLP research, and for more accurate models of theorganization of linguistic information in the human brain.</description><author>Taha Binhuraib, Greta Tuckute, Nicholas Blauch</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:54:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18745v1</guid></item><item><title>Who cuts emissions, who turns up the heat? causal machine learning estimates of energy efficiency interventions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04478v2</link><description>Reducing domestic energy demand is central to climate mitigation and fuelpoverty strategies, yet the impact of energy efficiency interventions is highlyheterogeneous. Using a causal machine learning model trained on nationallyrepresentative data of the English housing stock, we estimate average andconditional treatment effects of wall insulation on gas consumption, focusingon distributional effects across energy burden subgroups. While interventionsreduce gas demand on average (by as much as 19 percent), low energy burdengroups achieve substantial savings, whereas those experiencing high energyburdens see little to no reduction. This pattern reflects abehaviourally-driven mechanism: households constrained by high costs-to-incomeratios (e.g. more than 0.1) reallocate savings toward improved thermal comfortrather than lowering consumption. Far from wasteful, such responses representrational adjustments in contexts of prior deprivation, with potentialco-benefits for health and well-being.

A keyadvantage of these models is that for an incoming signal frame from a stream ofdata, the model is called only once for enhancement. In contrast, generativeSpeech Enhancement models often require multiple calls, resulting in acomputational complexity that is too high for many online speech enhancementapplications. This work presents the Diffusion Buffer, a generativediffusion-based Speech Enhancement model which only requires one neural networkcall per incoming signal frame from a stream of data and performs enhancementin an online fashion on a consumer-grade GPU. The key idea of the DiffusionBuffer is to align physical time with Diffusion time-steps. The approachprogressively denoises frames through physical time, where past frames havemore noise removed. Consequently, an enhanced frame is output to the listenerwith a delay defined by the Diffusion Buffer, and the output frame has acorresponding look-ahead. In this work, we extend upon our previous work bycarefully designing a 2D convolutional UNet architecture that specificallyaligns with the Diffusion Buffer's look-ahead. We observe that the proposedUNet improves performance, particularly when the algorithmic latency is low.Moreover, we show that using a Data Prediction loss instead of Denoising ScoreMatching loss enables flexible control over the trade-off between algorithmiclatency and quality during inference. The extended Diffusion Buffer equippedwith a novel NN and loss function drastically reduces the algorithmic latencyfrom 320 - 960 ms to 32 - 176 ms with an even increased performance. While ithas been shown before that offline generative diffusion models outperformpredictive approaches in unseen noisy speech data, we confirm that the onlineDiffusion Buffer also outperforms its predictive counterpart on unseen noisyspeech data.</description><author>Bunlong Lay, Rostislav Makarov, Simon Welker, Maris Hillemann, Timo Gerkmann</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:52:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18744v1</guid></item><item><title>Can Large Language Models Adequately Perform Symbolic Reasoning Over Time Series?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03963v3</link><description>Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspirationdating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challengein scientific discovery and artificial intelligence.

To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduceSymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoningover real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolicregression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike priorefforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse setof symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unifiedframework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loopsymbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators.Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models,highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment,and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.</description><author>Zewen Liu, Juntong Ni, Xianfeng Tang, Max S.

In practice, SBI is often hinderedby model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-worldobservations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBIapproach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer processthat combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-baseddistribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limitsscalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortizedSBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into asingle, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with aclosed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspondto the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpairedsamples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate theOT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access attest time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--includingcomplex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses theperformance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,misspecified environments.</description><author>Ortal Senouf, Antoine Wehenkel, Cédric Vincent-Cuaz, Emmanuel Abbé, Pascal Frossard</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:45:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15593v3</guid></item><item><title>SEAL: Semantic-Aware Hierarchical Learning for Generalized Category Discovery</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18740v1</link><description>This paper investigates the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).Given a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelledimages, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes.

However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes staticillumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle,which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopicscenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGSmethods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between thecamera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimatelydegrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider theillumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physicalcharacters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, animproved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearanceunder varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling withtwo types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adaptto photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure thegeometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an ImprovedGeometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussiangeometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input isleveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner.Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ourproposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis andaccurate geometric reconstruction.

Our approach employs acompetence-gated curriculum that incrementally increases dialogue difficulty(in terms of instruction shards), stabilizing training while promotingreliability. Using multi-turn, on-policy rollouts and a mixed-reward system,RLAAR teaches models to balance problem-solving with informed abstention,reducing premature answering behaviors that cause LiC. Evaluated on LiCbenchmarks, RLAAR significantly mitigates LiC performance decay (62.6% to75.1%) and improves calibrated abstention rates (33.5% to 73.4%).

When datascarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, thereason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where theembedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting themodels to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial toprovide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance oncode-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching pointswhere recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysisemphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation,we leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language tohighlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at thoselocations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates contextbias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- therebyimproving the model's robustness.

A keychallenge therein is how to effectively reveal fairness bugs under anintractable sample size using perturbation. Much current work has been focusingon designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge aboutdata characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limitingtheir full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposinga generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT.Through causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the mostdirectly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitivecounterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such acausal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guidea test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT servesas a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators.Extensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerablyimprove arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of thecases with acceptable extra runtime overhead. Compared with a state-of-the-artapproach that ranks the non-sensitive features solely based on correlation,CausalFT performs significantly better on 64% cases while being much moreefficient. Further, CausalFT can better improve bias resilience in nearly allcases.</description><author>Chengwen Du, Tao Chen</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:20:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18719v1</guid></item><item><title>Grasp Any Region: Towards Precise, Contextual Pixel Understanding for Multimodal LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18876v1</link><description>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holisticunderstanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes,requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and objectinter-relationships.

To address this, we introduceGrasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturallyachieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-formquestions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description toactive dialogue.

Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintainsthe state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multipleprompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78Bon GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperformsin-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strongcapabilities can be easily transferred to videos.</description><author>Haochen Wang, Yuhao Wang, Tao Zhang, Yikang Zhou, Yanwei Li, Jiacong Wang, Ye Tian, Jiahao Meng, Zilong Huang, Guangcan Mai, Anran Wang, Yunhai Tong, Zhuochen Wang, Xiangtai Li, Zhaoxiang Zhang</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18876v1</guid></item></channel></rss>
