However, existing open LMMslargely focus on single-image tasks, their applications to multi-imagescenarios remains less explored. Additionally, prior LMM research separatelytackles different scenarios, leaving it impossible to generalize crossscenarios with new emerging capabilities. To this end, we introduceLLaVA-NeXT-Interleave, which simultaneously tackles Multi-image, Multi-frame(video), Multi-view (3D), and Multi-patch (single-image) scenarios in LMMs. Toenable these capabilities, we regard the interleaved data format as a generaltemplate and compile the M4-Instruct dataset with 1,177.6k samples, spanning 4primary domains with 14 tasks and 41 datasets. We also curate theLLaVA-Interleave Bench to comprehensively evaluate the multi-image performanceof LMMs. Through extensive experiments, LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave achieves leadingresults in multi-image, video, and 3D benchmarks, while maintaining theperformance of single-image tasks. Besides, our model also exhibits severalemerging capabilities, e.g., transferring tasks across different settings andmodalities.

In this paper, we study the impact of bias inside the original dataseton the performance of dataset distillation. With a comprehensive empiricalevaluation on canonical datasets with color, corruption and background biases,we found that color and background biases in the original dataset will beamplified through the distillation process, resulting in a notable decline inthe performance of models trained on the distilled dataset, while corruptionbias is suppressed through the distillation process. To reduce biasamplification in dataset distillation, we introduce a simple yet highlyeffective approach based on a sample reweighting scheme utilizing kerneldensity estimation. Empirical results on multiple real-world and syntheticdatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, onCMNIST with 5% bias-conflict ratio and IPC 50, our method achieves 91.5% testaccuracy compared to 23.8% from vanilla DM, boosting the performance by 67.7%,whereas applying state-of-the-art debiasing method on the same dataset onlyachieves 53.7% accuracy. Our findings highlight the importance of addressingbiases in dataset distillation and provide a promising avenue to address biasamplification in the process.</description><author>Justin Cui, Ruochen Wang, Yuanhao Xiong, Cho-Jui Hsieh</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 17:58:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06609v2</guid></item><item><title>Training on the Test Task Confounds Evaluation and Emergence</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07890v1</link><description>We study a fundamental problem in the evaluation of large language modelsthat we call training on the test task. Unlike wrongful practices like trainingon the test data, leakage, or data contamination, training on the test task isnot a malpractice. Rather, the term describes a growing set of techniques toinclude task-relevant data in the pretraining stage of a language model. Wedemonstrate that training on the test task confounds both relative modelevaluations and claims about emergent capabilities. We argue that the seemingsuperiority of one model family over another may be explained by a differentdegree of training on the test task. To this end, we propose an effectivemethod to adjust for training on the test task by fine-tuning each model undercomparison on the same task-relevant data before evaluation. We then show thatinstances of emergent behavior largely vanish once we adjust for training onthe test task. This also applies to reported instances of emergent behaviorthat cannot be explained by the choice of evaluation metric. Our work promotesa new perspective on the evaluation of large language models with broadimplications for benchmarking and the study of emergent capabilities.</description><author>Ricardo Dominguez-Olmedo, Florian E.

Yet,constructing accurate predictive models for a variety of deformable objects,especially those with unknown physical properties, remains a significantchallenge. This paper introduces AdaptiGraph, a learning-based dynamicsmodeling approach that enables robots to predict, adapt to, and control a widearray of challenging deformable materials with unknown physical properties.AdaptiGraph leverages the highly flexible graph-based neural dynamics (GBND)framework, which represents material bits as particles and employs a graphneural network (GNN) to predict particle motion. Its key innovation is aunified physical property-conditioned GBND model capable of predicting themotions of diverse materials with varying physical properties withoutretraining. Upon encountering new materials during online deployment,AdaptiGraph utilizes a physical property optimization process for a few-shotadaptation of the model, enhancing its fit to the observed interaction data.The adapted models can precisely simulate the dynamics and predict the motionof various deformable materials, such as ropes, granular media, rigid boxes,and cloth, while adapting to different physical properties, includingstiffness, granular size, and center of pressure. On prediction andmanipulation tasks involving a diverse set of real-world deformable objects,our method exhibits superior prediction accuracy and task proficiency overnon-material-conditioned and non-adaptive models.

Nevertheless, due to distribution disparities between differentdemographic groups, fairness in high-stake decision-making systems is receivingincreasing attention. Although lots of recent works devoted to improving thefairness of GNNs and achieved considerable success, they all requiresignificant architectural changes or additional loss functions requiring morehyper-parameter tuning. Surprisingly, we find that simple re-balancing methodscan easily match or surpass existing fair GNN methods. We claim that theimbalance across different demographic groups is a significant source ofunfairness, resulting in imbalanced contributions from each group to theparameters updating. However, these simple re-balancing methods have their ownshortcomings during training. In this paper, we propose FairGB, Fair GraphNeural Network via re-Balancing, which mitigates the unfairness of GNNs bygroup balancing. Technically, FairGB consists of two modules: counterfactualnode mixup and contribution alignment loss. Firstly, we select counterfactualpairs across inter-domain and inter-class, and interpolate the ego-networks togenerate new samples. Guided by analysis, we can reveal the debiasing mechanismof our model by the causal view and prove that our strategy can make sensitiveattributes statistically independent from target labels. Secondly, we reweighthe contribution of each group according to gradients. By combining these twomodules, they can mutually promote each other. Experimental results onbenchmark datasets show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art resultsconcerning both utility and fairness metrics.

Evaluating LLMs at Temporal Generalization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08460v2</link><description>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights the urgentneed for evolving evaluation methodologies that keep pace with improvements inlanguage comprehension and information processing. However, traditionalbenchmarks, which are often static, fail to capture the continually changinginformation landscape, leading to a disparity between the perceived and actualeffectiveness of LLMs in ever-changing real-world scenarios. Our study examinestemporal generalization, which includes the ability to understand, predict, andgenerate text relevant to past, present, and future contexts, revealingsignificant temporal biases in LLMs. We propose an evaluation framework, fordynamically generating benchmarks from recent real-world predictions.Experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle with temporal generalization,showing performance decline over time. These findings highlight the necessityfor improved training and updating processes to enhance adaptability and reducebiases.

However, these methods oftenutilize simplified tactile signals due to the gap between tactile simulationand the real world. We introduce a sensor model for tactile skin that enableszero-shot sim-to-real transfer of ternary shear and binary normal forces. Usingthis model, we develop an RL policy that leverages sliding contact fordexterous in-hand translation. We conduct extensive real-world experiments toassess how tactile sensing facilitates policy adaptation to various unseenobject properties and robot hand orientations. We demonstrate that our 3-axistactile policies consistently outperform baselines that use only shear forces,only normal forces, or only proprioception.

We categorize noise into pointwise noise, whichincludes low-quality data points, and pairwise noise, which encompasseserroneous data pair associations that affect preference rankings. UtilizingDistributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), we enhance DPO's resilience tothese types of noise. Our theoretical insights reveal that DPO inherentlyembeds DRO principles, conferring robustness to pointwise noise, with theregularization coefficient $\beta$ playing a critical role in its noiseresistance. Extending this framework, we introduce DistributionallyRobustifying DPO (Dr. DPO), which integrates pairwise robustness by optimizingagainst worst-case pairwise scenarios. The novel hyperparameter $\beta'$ in Dr.DPO allows for fine-tuned control over data pair reliability, providing astrategic balance between exploration and exploitation in noisy trainingenvironments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Dr. DPO substantiallyimproves the quality of generated text and response accuracy in preferencedatasets, showcasing enhanced performance in both noisy and noise-freesettings.

Can we similarlyunlock image-generation models for visuomotor control? We present GENIMA, abehavior-cloning agent that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to 'draw joint-actions'as targets on RGB images. These images are fed into a controller that maps thevisual targets into a sequence of joint-positions. We study GENIMA on 25RLBench and 9 real-world manipulation tasks. We find that, by lifting actionsinto image-space, internet pre-trained diffusion models can generate policiesthat outperform state-of-the-art visuomotor approaches, especially inrobustness to scene perturbations and generalizing to novel objects. Our methodis also competitive with 3D agents, despite lacking priors such as depth,keypoints, or motion-planners.</description><author>Mohit Shridhar, Yat Long Lo, Stephen James</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 17:41:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07875v1</guid></item><item><title>Toto: Time Series Optimized Transformer for Observability</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07874v1</link><description>This technical report describes the Time Series Optimized Transformer forObservability (Toto), a new state of the art foundation model for time seriesforecasting developed by Datadog.

Today, many benchmarks exist to measure LLMknowledge and reasoning on textbook-style science questions, but few if anybenchmarks are designed to evaluate language model performance on practicaltasks required for scientific research, such as literature search, protocolplanning, and data analysis. As a step toward building such benchmarks, weintroduce the Language Agent Biology Benchmark (LAB-Bench), a broad dataset ofover 2,400 multiple choice questions for evaluating AI systems on a range ofpractical biology research capabilities, including recall and reasoning overliterature, interpretation of figures, access and navigation of databases, andcomprehension and manipulation of DNA and protein sequences. Importantly, incontrast to previous scientific benchmarks, we expect that an AI system thatcan achieve consistently high scores on the more difficult LAB-Bench taskswould serve as a useful assistant for researchers in areas such as literaturesearch and molecular cloning. As an initial assessment of the emergentscientific task capabilities of frontier language models, we measureperformance of several against our benchmark and report results compared tohuman expert biology researchers. We will continue to update and expandLAB-Bench over time, and expect it to serve as a useful tool in the developmentof automated research systems going forward.

In this work, we tackle it through a principled unifiedframework using deterministic or stochastic evolutions described by partialdifferential equations (PDEs). This framework incorporates priortrajectory-based sampling methods, such as diffusion models or Schr\"odingerbridges, without relying on the concept of time-reversals. Moreover, it allowsus to propose novel numerical methods for solving the transport task and thussampling from complicated targets without the need for the normalizationconstant or data samples. We employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) toapproximate the respective PDE solutions, implying both conceptional andcomputational advantages. In particular, PINNs allow for simulation- anddiscretization-free optimization and can be trained very efficiently, leadingto significantly better mode coverage in the sampling task compared toalternative methods. Moreover, they can readily be fine-tuned with Gauss-Newtonmethods to achieve high accuracy in sampling.</description><author>Jingtong Sun, Julius Berner, Lorenz Richter, Marius Zeinhofer, Johannes Müller, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Anima Anandkumar</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 17:39:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07873v1</guid></item><item><title>A Clinical Benchmark of Public Self-Supervised Pathology Foundation Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06508v2</link><description>The use of self-supervised learning (SSL) to train pathology foundationmodels has increased substantially in the past few years. Notably, severalmodels trained on large quantities of clinical data have been made publiclyavailable in recent months. This will significantly enhance scientific researchin computational pathology and help bridge the gap between research andclinical deployment. With the increase in availability of public foundationmodels of different sizes, trained using different algorithms on differentdatasets, it becomes important to establish a benchmark to compare theperformance of such models on a variety of clinically relevant tasks spanningmultiple organs and diseases. In this work, we present a collection ofpathology datasets comprising clinical slides associated with clinicallyrelevant endpoints including cancer diagnoses and a variety of biomarkersgenerated during standard hospital operation from two medical centers.

Similarly, two views of distinct images form a negativepair, with encouraged low similarity. Typically, a single similarity measure,provided by a lone projection head, evaluates positive and negative samplepairs. However, due to diverse augmentation strategies and varying intra-samplesimilarity, views from the same image may not always be similar. Additionally,owing to inter-sample similarity, views from different images may be more akinthan those from the same image. Consequently, enforcing high similarity forpositive pairs and low similarity for negative pairs may be unattainable, andin some cases, such enforcement could detrimentally impact performance. Toaddress this challenge, we propose using multiple projection heads, eachproducing a distinct set of features. Our pre-training loss function emergesfrom a solution to the maximum likelihood estimation over head-wise posteriordistributions of positive samples given observations. This loss incorporatesthe similarity measure over positive and negative pairs, each re-weighted by anindividual adaptive temperature, regulated to prevent ill solutions. Ourapproach, Adaptive Multi-Head Contrastive Learning (AMCL), can be applied toand experimentally enhances several popular contrastive learning methods suchas SimCLR, MoCo, and Barlow Twins. The improvement remains consistent acrossvarious backbones and linear probing epochs, and becomes more significant whenemploying multiple augmentation methods.</description><author>Lei Wang, Piotr Koniusz, Tom Gedeon, Liang Zheng</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 17:37:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05615v2</guid></item><item><title>Trial and Error: Exploration-Based Trajectory Optimization for LLM Agents</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02502v2</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral components in variousautonomous agent systems. In this study, we present an exploration-basedtrajectory optimization approach, referred to as ETO. This learning method isdesigned to enhance the performance of open LLM agents. Contrary to previousstudies that exclusively train on successful expert trajectories, our methodallows agents to learn from their exploration failures. This leads to improvedperformance through an iterative optimization framework. During the explorationphase, the agent interacts with the environment while completing given tasks,gathering failure trajectories to create contrastive trajectory pairs. In thesubsequent training phase, the agent utilizes these trajectory preference pairsto update its policy using contrastive learning methods like DPO. Thisiterative cycle of exploration and training fosters continued improvement inthe agents. Our experiments on three complex tasks demonstrate that ETOconsistently surpasses baseline performance by a large margin.

However, traditional machine learningapproaches by aggregating data on a central server and centralized processingare memory-intensive and raise privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) hasemerged as a solution by training a global model collaboratively acrossmultiple devices by exchanging their local model parameters instead of localdata. However, in realistic settings, sensor data on devices isnon-independently and identically distributed (Non-IID). This means that dataactivity recorded by most devices is sparse, and sensor data distribution foreach client may be inconsistent. As a result, typical FL frameworks inheterogeneous environments suffer from slow convergence and poor performancedue to deviation of the global model's objective from the global objective.Most FL methods applied to HAR are either designed for overly ideal scenarioswithout considering the Non-IID problem or present privacy and scalabilityconcerns. This work addresses these challenges, proposing CDFL, an efficientfederated learning framework for image-based HAR. CDFL efficiently selects arepresentative set of privacy-preserved images using contrastive learning anddeep clustering, reduces communication overhead by selecting effective clientsfor global model updates, and improves global model quality by training onprivacy-preserved data. Our comprehensive experiments carried out on threepublic datasets, namely Stanford40, PPMI, and VOC2012, demonstrate thesuperiority of CDFL in terms of performance, convergence rate, and bandwidthusage compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description><author>Ensieh Khazaei, Alireza Esmaeilzehi, Bilal Taha, Dimitrios Hatzinakos</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2024 03:17:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12287v1</guid></item><item><title>Adversarial Robustness Limits via Scaling-Law and Human-Alignment Studies</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09349v2</link><description>This paper revisits the simple, long-studied, yet still unsolved problem ofmaking image classifiers robust to imperceptible perturbations. Taking CIFAR10as an example, SOTA clean accuracy is about $100$%, but SOTA robustness to$\ell_{\infty}$-norm bounded perturbations barely exceeds $70$%. To understandthis gap, we analyze how model size, dataset size, and synthetic data qualityaffect robustness by developing the first scaling laws for adversarialtraining. Our scaling laws reveal inefficiencies in prior art and provideactionable feedback to advance the field. For instance, we discovered that SOTAmethods diverge notably from compute-optimal setups, using excess compute fortheir level of robustness. Leveraging a compute-efficient setup, we surpass theprior SOTA with $20$% ($70$%) fewer training (inference) FLOPs. We trainedvarious compute-efficient models, with our best achieving $74$% AutoAttackaccuracy ($+3$% gain). However, our scaling laws also predict robustness slowlygrows then plateaus at $90$%: dwarfing our new SOTA by scaling is impractical,and perfect robustness is impossible. To better understand this predictedlimit, we carry out a small-scale human evaluation on the AutoAttack data thatfools our top-performing model. Concerningly, we estimate that humanperformance also plateaus near $90$%, which we show to be attributable to$\ell_{\infty}$-constrained attacks' generation of invalid images notconsistent with their original labels. Having characterized limitingroadblocks, we outline promising paths for future research.</description><author>Brian R.

Current practices involvecollecting data in one location, training imitation learning or reinforcementlearning policies with this data, and deploying the policy in the samelocation. However, this approach lacks scalability as it necessitates datacollection in multiple locations for each task. This paper proposes a novelapproach where data is collected in a location predominantly featuring greenscreens. We introduce Green-screen Augmentation (GreenAug), employing a chromakey algorithm to overlay background textures onto a green screen. Throughextensive real-world empirical studies with over 850 training demonstrationsand 8.2k evaluation episodes, we demonstrate that GreenAug surpasses noaugmentation, standard computer vision augmentation, and prior generativeaugmentation methods in performance. While no algorithmic novelties areclaimed, our paper advocates for a fundamental shift in data collectionpractices. We propose that real-world demonstrations in future research shouldutilise green screens, followed by the application of GreenAug. We believeGreenAug unlocks policy generalisation to visually distinct novel locations,addressing the current scene generalisation limitations in robot learning.</description><author>Eugene Teoh, Sumit Patidar, Xiao Ma, Stephen James</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 17:32:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07868v1</guid></item><item><title>Recursive Visual Programming</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02249v2</link><description>Visual Programming (VP) has emerged as a powerful framework for VisualQuestion Answering (VQA).

Inspired by humancoding practices, we propose Recursive Visual Programming (RVP), whichsimplifies generated routines, provides more efficient problem solving, and canmanage more complex data structures. RVP is inspired by human coding practicesand approaches VQA tasks with an iterative recursive code generation approach,allowing decomposition of complicated problems into smaller parts. Notably, RVPis capable of dynamic type assignment, i.e., as the system recursivelygenerates a new piece of code, it autonomously determines the appropriatereturn type and crafts the requisite code to generate that output. We showRVP's efficacy through extensive experiments on benchmarks including VSR, COVR,GQA, and NextQA, underscoring the value of adopting human-like recursive andmodular programming techniques for solving VQA tasks through coding.</description><author>Jiaxin Ge, Sanjay Subramanian, Baifeng Shi, Roei Herzig, Trevor Darrell</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 17:26:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02249v2</guid></item><item><title>Controlling Space and Time with Diffusion Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07860v1</link><description>We present 4DiM, a cascaded diffusion model for 4D novel view synthesis(NVS), conditioned on one or more images of a general scene, and a set ofcamera poses and timestamps.

We propose a novel featurematching method named RCM, which Raises the Ceiling of Matching from threeaspects. 1) RCM introduces a dynamic view switching mechanism to address thescarcity of matchable points in source images by strategically switching imagepairs. 2) RCM proposes a conflict-free coarse matching module, addressingmatching conflicts in the target image through a many-to-one matching strategy.3) By integrating the semi-sparse paradigm and the coarse-to-fine architecture,RCM preserves the benefits of both high efficiency and global search,mitigating the reliance on keypoint repeatability. As a result, RCM enablesmore matchable points in the source image to be matched in an exhaustive andconflict-free manner in the target image, leading to a substantial 260%increase in ground-truth matches. Comprehensive experiments show that RCMexhibits remarkable performance and efficiency in comparison tostate-of-the-art methods.</description><author>Xiaoyong Lu, Songlin Du</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 16:06:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07789v1</guid></item><item><title>Multimodal Self-Instruct: Synthetic Abstract Image and Visual Reasoning Instruction Using Language Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07053v2</link><description>Although most current large multimodal models (LMMs) can already understandphotos of natural scenes and portraits, their understanding of abstract images,e.g., charts, maps, or layouts, and visual reasoning capabilities remains quiterudimentary.

Much work has focused on the casewhere the symmetry group employed is compact or abelian, or both. Recent workhas explored enlarging the class of transformations used to the case of Liegroups, principally through the use of their Lie algebra, as well as the groupexponential and logarithm maps. The applicability of such methods is limited bythe fact that depending on the group of interest $G$, the exponential map maynot be surjective. Further limitations are encountered when $G$ is neithercompact nor abelian. Using the structure and geometry of Lie groups and theirhomogeneous spaces, we present a framework by which it is possible to work withsuch groups primarily focusing on the groups $G = \text{GL}^{+}(n, \mathbb{R})$and $G = \text{SL}(n, \mathbb{R})$, as well as their representation as affinetransformations $\mathbb{R}^{n} \rtimes G$. Invariant integration as well as aglobal parametrization is realized by a decomposition into subgroups andsubmanifolds which can be handled individually. Under this framework, we showhow convolution kernels can be parametrized to build models equivariant withrespect to affine transformations.

Popular neuralarchitectures such as Transformers lack strong structural inductive biases forseq2seq NLP tasks on their own. Consequently, they struggle with systematicgeneralization beyond the training distribution, e.g. with extrapolating tolonger inputs, even when pre-trained on large amounts of text. We show how astructural inductive bias can be efficiently injected into a seq2seq model bypre-training it to simulate structural transformations on synthetic data.Specifically, we inject an inductive bias towards Finite State Transducers(FSTs) into a Transformer by pre-training it to simulate FSTs given theirdescriptions. Our experiments show that our method imparts the desiredinductive bias, resulting in improved systematic generalization and betterfew-shot learning for FST-like tasks. Our analysis shows that fine-tuned modelsaccurately capture the state dynamics of the unseen underlying FSTs, suggestingthat the simulation process is internalized by the fine-tuned model.</description><author>Matthias Lindemann, Alexander Koller, Ivan Titov</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 17:09:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00796v3</guid></item><item><title>OV-DINO: Unified Open-Vocabulary Detection with Language-Aware Selective Fusion</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07844v1</link><description>Open-vocabulary detection is a challenging task due to the requirement ofdetecting objects based on class names, including those not encountered duringtraining. Existing methods have shown strong zero-shot detection capabilitiesthrough pre-training on diverse large-scale datasets. However, these approachesstill face two primary challenges: (i) how to universally integrate diversedata sources for end-to-end training, and (ii) how to effectively leverage thelanguage-aware capability for region-level cross-modality understanding. Toaddress these challenges, we propose a novel unified open-vocabulary detectionmethod called OV-DINO, which pre-trains on diverse large-scale datasets withlanguage-aware selective fusion in a unified framework. Specifically, weintroduce a Unified Data Integration (UniDI) pipeline to enable end-to-endtraining and eliminate noise from pseudo-label generation by unifying differentdata sources into detection-centric data. In addition, we propose aLanguage-Aware Selective Fusion (LASF) module to enable the language-awareability of the model through a language-aware query selection and fusionprocess. We evaluate the performance of the proposed OV-DINO on popularopen-vocabulary detection benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-artresults with an AP of 50.6\% on the COCO dataset and 40.0\% on the LVIS datasetin a zero-shot manner, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.Furthermore, the fine-tuned OV-DINO on COCO achieves 58.4\% AP, outperformingmany existing methods with the same backbone.

A constant challenge inthe analysis of digital Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is the problem of aggregatingtens of thousands of tile-level image embeddings to a slide-levelrepresentation. Due to the prevalent use of datasets created for genomicresearch, such as TCGA, for method development, the performance of thesetechniques on diagnostic slides from clinical practice has been inadequatelyexplored. This study conducts a thorough benchmarking analysis of tenslide-level aggregation techniques across nine clinically relevant tasks,including diagnostic assessment, biomarker classification, and outcomeprediction. The results yield following key insights: (1) Embeddings derivedfrom domain-specific (histological images) FMs outperform those from genericImageNet-based models across aggregation methods. (2) Spatial-aware aggregatorsenhance the performance significantly when using ImageNet pre-trained modelsbut not when using FMs. (3) No single model excels in all tasks andspatially-aware models do not show general superiority as it would be expected.These findings underscore the need for more adaptable and universallyapplicable aggregation techniques, guiding future research towards tools thatbetter meet the evolving needs of clinical-AI in pathology.

Despite advancements in empirical, physics-based, andmachine-learning models using real-time solar wind data, accurately forecastingextreme geomagnetic events remains challenging due to noise and sensorfailures. This research introduces TriQXNet, a novel hybrid classical-quantumneural network for Dst forecasting. Our model integrates classical and quantumcomputing, conformal prediction, and explainable AI (XAI) within a hybridarchitecture. To ensure high-quality input data, we developed a comprehensivepreprocessing pipeline that included feature selection, normalization,aggregation, and imputation. TriQXNet processes preprocessed solar wind datafrom NASA's ACE and NOAA's DSCOVR satellites, predicting the Dst index for thecurrent hour and the next, providing vital advance notice to mitigategeomagnetic storm impacts. TriQXNet outperforms 13 state-of-the-art hybriddeep-learning models, achieving a root mean squared error of 9.27 nanoteslas(nT). Rigorous evaluation through 10-fold cross-validated paired t-testsconfirmed its superior performance with 95% confidence. Conformal predictiontechniques provide quantifiable uncertainty, which is essential for operationaldecisions, while XAI methods like ShapTime enhance interpretability.Comparative analysis shows TriQXNet's superior forecasting accuracy, setting anew level of expectations for geomagnetic storm prediction and highlighting thepotential of classical-quantum hybrid models in space weather forecasting.</description><author>Md Abrar Jahin, M.

Solving it may unlock otherproblems, such as generalization, interpretability, or fairness. Whileremarkably difficult to solve in general, recent works have shown thatdisentanglement is provably achievable under additional assumptions that canleverage geometrical constraints, such as local isometry. To use theseinsights, we propose a novel perspective on disentangled representationlearning built on quadratic optimal transport. Specifically, we formulate theproblem in the Gromov-Monge setting, which seeks isometric mappings betweendistributions supported on different spaces. We propose the Gromov-Monge-Gap(GMG), a regularizer that quantifies the geometry-preservation of an arbitrarypush-forward map between two distributions supported on different spaces. Wedemonstrate the effectiveness of GMG regularization for disentanglement on fourstandard benchmarks. Moreover, we show that geometry preservation can evenencourage unsupervised disentanglement without the standard reconstructionobjective - making the underlying model decoder-free, and promising a morepractically viable and scalable perspective on unsupervised disentanglement.</description><author>Théo Uscidda, Luca Eyring, Karsten Roth, Fabian Theis, Zeynep Akata, Marco Cuturi</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 16:51:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07829v1</guid></item><item><title>Multi-Channel Masked Autoencoder and Comprehensive Evaluations for Reconstructing 12-Lead ECG from Arbitrary Single-Lead ECG</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11481v1</link><description>In the context of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that exhibit an elevatedprevalence and mortality, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a popular and standarddiagnostic tool for doctors, commonly utilizing a 12-lead configuration inclinical practice. However, the 10 electrodes placed on the surface would causea lot of inconvenience and discomfort, while the rapidly advancing wearabledevices adopt the reduced-lead or single-lead ECG to reduce discomfort as asolution in long-term monitoring. Since the single-lead ECG is a subset of12-lead ECG, it provides insufficient cardiac health information and plays asubstandard role in real-world healthcare applications. Hence, it is necessaryto utilize signal generation technologies to reduce their clinical importancegap by reconstructing 12-lead ECG from the real single-lead ECG. Specifically,this study proposes a multi-channel masked autoencoder (MCMA) for this goal. Inthe experimental results, the visualized results between the generated and realsignals can demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. At thesame time, this study introduces a comprehensive evaluation benchmark namedECGGenEval, encompassing the signal-level, feature-level, and diagnostic-levelevaluations, providing a holistic assessment of 12-lead ECG signals andgenerative model. Further, the quantitative experimental results are asfollows, the mean square errors of 0.0178 and 0.0658, correlation coefficientsof 0.7698 and 0.7237 in the signal-level evaluation, the average F1-score withtwo generated 12-lead ECG is 0.8319 and 0.7824 in the diagnostic-levelevaluation, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.

This paper proposes a new approach for measuring thereliability of predictions under distribution shifts. We analyze how theoutputs of a trained neural network change using clustering to measuredistances between outputs and class centroids. We propose this distance as ametric to evaluate the confidence of predictions under distribution shifts. Weassign each prediction to a cluster with centroid representing the mean softmaxoutput for all correct predictions of a given class. We then define a safetythreshold for a class as the smallest distance from an incorrect prediction tothe given class centroid. We evaluate the approach on the MNIST and CIFAR-10datasets using a Convolutional Neural Network and a Vision Transformer,respectively. The results show that our approach is consistent across thesedata sets and network models, and indicate that the proposed metric can offeran efficient way of determining when automated predictions are acceptable andwhen they should be deferred to human operators given a distribution shift.</description><author>Daniel Sikar, Artur Garcez, Tillman Weyde, Robin Bloomfield, Kaleem Peeroo</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 16:45:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07821v1</guid></item><item><title>Analysis of Langevin Monte Carlo from Poincaré to Log-Sobolev</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12662v2</link><description>Classically, the continuous-time Langevin diffusion converges exponentiallyfast to its stationary distribution $\pi$ under the sole assumption that $\pi$satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality.

Most existing methods render particles via rasterization,projecting them to screen space tiles for processing in a sorted order. Thiswork instead considers ray tracing the particles, building a bounding volumehierarchy and casting a ray for each pixel using high-performance GPU raytracing hardware. To efficiently handle large numbers of semi-transparentparticles, we describe a specialized rendering algorithm which encapsulatesparticles with bounding meshes to leverage fast ray-triangle intersections, andshades batches of intersections in depth-order. The benefits of ray tracing arewell-known in computer graphics: processing incoherent rays for secondarylighting effects such as shadows and reflections, rendering fromhighly-distorted cameras common in robotics, stochastically sampling rays, andmore. With our renderer, this flexibility comes at little cost compared torasterization. Experiments demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our approach,as well as several applications in computer graphics and vision.

Similarly, thecorresponding labels are linearly combined by a fixed ratio $\lambda$ by l. Theobjects in two images may be overlapped during the mixing process, so somesemantic information is corrupted in the mixed samples. In this case, the mixedimage does not match the mixed label information. Besides, such a label maymislead the deep learning model training, which results in poor performance.

In this work we propose Random SubspaceAdaptation (ROSA), a method that outperforms previous PEFT methods by asignificant margin, while maintaining a zero latency overhead during inferencetime. In contrast to previous methods, ROSA is able to adapt subspaces ofarbitrarily large dimension, better approximating full-finetuning.

We also encourage submissions ofresults from other LLMs. In total, we simulated 2,310 matches (5 sessions foreach pair among 7 LLMs and a random player) across three types of games, usingthree distinct prompt types: list, illustration, and image. The resultsrevealed significant variations in LLM performance across different games andprompt types, with analysis covering win and disqualification rates, missedopportunity analysis, and invalid move analysis. The details of the leaderboardand result matrix data are available as open-access data on GitHub. This studyenhances our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in playing games they were notspecifically trained for, helping to assess their rule comprehension andstrategic thinking. On the path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), thisstudy lays the groundwork for future exploration into their utility in complexdecision-making scenarios, illuminating their strategic thinking abilities andoffering directions for further inquiry into the limits of LLMs withingame-based frameworks.</description><author>Oguzhan Topsakal, Colby Jacob Edell, Jackson Bailey Harper</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 16:14:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07796v1</guid></item><item><title>End-to-end data-driven weather forecasting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00411v2</link><description>Weather forecasting is critical for a range of human activities includingtransportation, agriculture, industry, as well as the safety of the generalpublic. Machine learning models have the potential to transform the complexweather prediction pipeline, but current approaches still rely on numericalweather prediction (NWP) systems, limiting forecast speed and accuracy. Here wedemonstrate that a machine learning model can replace the entire operationalNWP pipeline. Aardvark Weather, an end-to-end data-driven weather predictionsystem, ingests raw observations and outputs global gridded forecasts and localstation forecasts. Further, it can be optimised end-to-end to maximiseperformance over quantities of interest. Global forecasts outperform anoperational NWP baseline for multiple variables and lead times. Local stationforecasts are skillful up to ten days lead time and achieve comparable andoften lower errors than a post-processed global NWP baseline and astate-of-the-art end-to-end forecasting system with input from humanforecasters. These forecasts are produced with a remarkably simple neuralprocess model using just 8\% of the input data and three orders of magnitudeless compute than existing NWP and hybrid AI-NWP methods. We anticipate thatAardvark Weather will be the starting point for a new generation of end-to-endmachine learning models for medium-range forecasting that will reducecomputational costs by orders of magnitude and enable the rapid and cheapcreation of bespoke models for users in a variety of fields, including for thedeveloping world where state-of-the-art local models are not currentlyavailable.</description><author>Anna Vaughan, Stratis Markou, Will Tebbutt, James Requeima, Wessel P.

However, the securityimplications of these LLM-based multi-agent systems have not been thoroughlyinvestigated, particularly concerning the spread of manipulated knowledge. Inthis paper, we investigate this critical issue by constructing a detailedthreat model and a comprehensive simulation environment that mirrors real-worldmulti-agent deployments in a trusted platform. Subsequently, we propose a noveltwo-stage attack method involving Persuasiveness Injection and ManipulatedKnowledge Injection to systematically explore the potential for manipulatedknowledge (i.e., counterfactual and toxic knowledge) spread without explicitprompt manipulation. Our method leverages the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs in handling worldknowledge, which can be exploited by attackers to unconsciously spreadfabricated information. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ourattack method can successfully induce LLM-based agents to spread bothcounterfactual and toxic knowledge without degrading their foundationalcapabilities during agent communication. Furthermore, we show that thesemanipulations can persist through popular retrieval-augmented generationframeworks, where several benign agents store and retrieve manipulated chathistories for future interactions. This persistence indicates that even afterthe interaction has ended, the benign agents may continue to be influenced bymanipulated knowledge. Our findings reveal significant security risks inLLM-based multi-agent systems, emphasizing the imperative need for robustdefenses against manipulated knowledge spread, such as introducing ``guardian''agents and advanced fact-checking tools.</description><author>Tianjie Ju, Yiting Wang, Xinbei Ma, Pengzhou Cheng, Haodong Zhao, Yulong Wang, Lifeng Liu, Jian Xie, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 16:08:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07791v1</guid></item><item><title>Manipulating Feature Visualizations with Gradient Slingshots</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06122v2</link><description>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are capable of learning complex and versatilerepresentations, however, the semantic nature of the learned concepts remainsunknown.

In this paper, wepresent Coarse-to-fine Reinforcement Learning (CRL), a framework that trains RLagents to zoom-into a continuous action space in a coarse-to-fine manner,enabling the use of stable, sample-efficient value-based RL algorithms forfine-grained continuous control tasks. Our key idea is to train agents thatoutput actions by iterating the procedure of (i) discretizing the continuousaction space into multiple intervals and (ii) selecting the interval with thehighest Q-value to further discretize at the next level. We then introduce aconcrete, value-based algorithm within the CRL framework called Coarse-to-fineQ-Network (CQN). Our experiments demonstrate that CQN significantly outperformsRL and behavior cloning baselines on 20 sparsely-rewarded RLBench manipulationtasks with a modest number of environment interactions and expertdemonstrations.

Recently, they have proven to bevaluable for uncovering subtle cell phenotypic differences that are notdirectly discernible to the human eye. However, current methods employed toachieve this goal mainly rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Whileeffective, GANs encompass issues such as training instability and modecollapse, and they do not accurately map images back to the model's latentspace, which is necessary to synthesize, manipulate, and thus interpret outputsbased on real images. In this work, we introduce PhenDiff: a multi-classconditional method leveraging Diffusion Models (DMs) designed to identifyshifts in cellular phenotypes by translating a real image from one condition toanother. We qualitatively and quantitatively validate this method on caseswhere the phenotypic changes are visible or invisible, such as in lowconcentrations of drug treatments. Overall, PhenDiff represents a valuable toolfor identifying cellular variations in real microscopy images. We anticipatethat it could facilitate the understanding of diseases and advance drugdiscovery through the identification of novel biomarkers.</description><author>Anis Bourou, Thomas Boyer, Kévin Daupin, Véronique Dubreuil, Aurélie De Thonel, Valérie Mezger, Auguste Genovesio</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 16:04:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08290v2</guid></item><item><title>The Human Factor in AI Red Teaming: Perspectives from Social and Collaborative Computing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07786v1</link><description>Rapid progress in general-purpose AI has sparked significant interest in "redteaming," a practice of adversarial testing originating in military andcybersecurity applications.

However, existingmulti-agent frameworks often struggle with integrating diverse capablethird-party agents due to reliance on agents defined within their ownecosystems. They also face challenges in simulating distributed environments,as most frameworks are limited to single-device setups. Furthermore, theseframeworks often rely on hard-coded communication pipelines, limiting theiradaptability to dynamic task requirements. Inspired by the concept of theInternet, we propose the Internet of Agents (IoA), a novel framework thataddresses these limitations by providing a flexible and scalable platform forLLM-based multi-agent collaboration. IoA introduces an agent integrationprotocol, an instant-messaging-like architecture design, and dynamic mechanismsfor agent teaming and conversation flow control. Through extensive experimentson general assistant tasks, embodied AI tasks, and retrieval-augmentedgeneration benchmarks, we demonstrate that IoA consistently outperformsstate-of-the-art baselines, showcasing its ability to facilitate effectivecollaboration among heterogeneous agents. IoA represents a step towards linkingdiverse agents in an Internet-like environment, where agents can seamlesslycollaborate to achieve greater intelligence and capabilities.

However, the method isbased on the assumption that we proceed through a sequence of Gaussian measuresin moving from the prior to the posterior, and that the forward model islinear. In this work, we introduce Sequential Kalman Monte Carlo (SKMC)samplers, where we exploit EKI and Flow Annealed Kalman Inversion (FAKI) withina Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling scheme to perform efficientgradient-free inference in Bayesian inverse problems. FAKI employs normalizingflows (NF) to relax the Gaussian ansatz of the target measures in EKI. NFs areable to learn invertible maps between a Gaussian latent space and the originaldata space, allowing us to perform EKI updates in the Gaussianized NF latentspace. However, FAKI alone is not able to correct for the model linearityassumptions in EKI. Errors in the particle distribution as we move through thesequence of target measures can therefore compound to give incorrect posteriormoment estimates. In this work we consider the use of EKI and FAKI toinitialize the particle distribution for each target in an adaptive SMCannealing scheme, before performing t-preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (tpCN)updates to distribute particles according to the target. We demonstrate theperformance of these SKMC samplers on three challenging numerical benchmarks,showing significant improvements in the rate of convergence compared tostandard SMC with importance weighted resampling at each temperature level.Code implementing the SKMC samplers is available athttps://github.com/RichardGrumitt/KalmanMC.</description><author>Richard D.

Inthis study, we find that confidence misalignment of the predictions, includingcategory-level overconfidence, instance-level task confidence inconsistency,and image-level confidence misfocusing, leading to the injection of noisypseudo label in the training process, will bring suboptimal performance on thetarget domain. To tackle this issue, we present a novel general frameworktermed Multi-Granularity Confidence Alignment Mean Teacher (MGCAMT) for crossdomain object detection, which alleviates confidence misalignment acrosscategory-, instance-, and image-levels simultaneously to obtain high qualitypseudo supervision for better teacher-student learning. Specifically, to alignconfidence with accuracy at category level, we propose ClassificationConfidence Alignment (CCA) to model category uncertainty based on EvidentialDeep Learning (EDL) and filter out the category incorrect labels via anuncertainty-aware selection strategy. Furthermore, to mitigate theinstance-level misalignment between classification and localization, we designTask Confidence Alignment (TCA) to enhance the interaction between the two taskbranches and allow each classification feature to adaptively locate the optimalfeature for the regression. Finally, we develop imagery Focusing ConfidenceAlignment (FCA) adopting another way of pseudo label learning, i.e., we use theoriginal outputs from the Mean Teacher network for supervised learning withoutlabel assignment to concentrate on holistic information in the target image.These three procedures benefit from each other from a cooperative learningperspective.</description><author>Jiangming Chen, Li Liu, Wanxia Deng, Zhen Liu, Yu Liu, Yingmei Wei, Yongxiang Liu</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 15:56:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07780v1</guid></item><item><title>Jack of All Trades, Master of Some, a Multi-Purpose Transformer Agent</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09844v3</link><description>The search for a general model that can operate seamlessly across multipledomains remains a key goal in machine learning research.

Thanks to the prompt tuning on large pre-trained visual languagemodels such as CLIP, recent literature shows impressively better CZSLperformance than traditional vision-based methods. However, the key aspectsthat impact the generalization to unseen compositions, including the diversityand informativeness of class context, and the entanglement between visualprimitives, i.e., state and object, are not properly addressed in existingCLIP-based CZSL literature. In this paper, we propose a model by prompting thelanguage-informed distribution, aka., PLID, for the CZSL task. Specifically,the PLID leverages pre-trained large language models (LLM) to (i) formulate thelanguage-informed class distributions which are diverse and informative, and(ii) enhance the compositionality of the class embedding. Moreover, avisual-language primitive decomposition (VLPD) module is proposed todynamically fuse the classification decisions from the compositional and theprimitive space. Orthogonal to the existing literature of soft, hard, ordistributional prompts, our method advocates prompting the LLM-supported classdistributions, leading to a better zero-shot generalization.

A Thought Experiment</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07778v1</link><description>AI systems make decisions in physical environments through primitive actionsor affordances that are accessed via API calls. While deploying AI agents inthe real world involves numerous high-level actions, existing embodiedsimulators offer a limited set of domain-salient APIs. This naturally brings upthe questions: how many primitive actions (APIs) are needed for a versatileembodied agent, and what should they look like? We explore this via a thoughtexperiment: assuming that wikiHow tutorials cover a wide variety ofhuman-written tasks, what is the space of APIs needed to cover theseinstructions? We propose a framework to iteratively induce new APIs bygrounding wikiHow instruction to situated agent policies. Inspired by recentsuccesses in large language models (LLMs) for embodied planning, we propose afew-shot prompting to steer GPT-4 to generate Pythonic programs as agentpolicies and bootstrap a universe of APIs by 1) reusing a seed set of APIs; andthen 2) fabricate new API calls when necessary. The focus of this thoughtexperiment is on defining these APIs rather than their executability. We applythe proposed pipeline on instructions from wikiHow tutorials. On a smallfraction (0.5%) of tutorials, we induce an action space of 300+ APIs necessaryfor capturing the rich variety of tasks in the physical world. A detailedautomatic and human analysis of the induction output reveals that the proposedpipeline enables effective reuse and creation of APIs. Moreover, a manualreview revealed that existing simulators support only a small subset of theinduced APIs (9 of the top 50 frequent APIs), motivating the development ofaction-rich embodied environments.</description><author>Jiefu Ou, Arda Uzunoglu, Benjamin Van Durme, Daniel Khashabi</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 15:52:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07778v1</guid></item><item><title>Bridging Synthetic and Real Worlds for Pre-training Scene Text Detectors</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05286v3</link><description>Existing scene text detection methods typically rely on extensive real datafor training. Due to the lack of annotated real images, recent works haveattempted to exploit large-scale labeled synthetic data (LSD) for pre-trainingtext detectors. However, a synth-to-real domain gap emerges, further limitingthe performance of text detectors. Differently, in this work, we proposeFreeReal, a real-domain-aligned pre-training paradigm that enables thecomplementary strengths of both LSD and unlabeled real data (URD).Specifically, to bridge real and synthetic worlds for pre-training, aglyph-based mixing mechanism (GlyphMix) is tailored for text images.GlyphMixdelineates the character structures of synthetic images and embeds them asgraffiti-like units onto real images. Without introducing real domain drift,GlyphMix freely yields real-world images with annotations derived fromsynthetic labels. Furthermore, when given free fine-grained synthetic labels,GlyphMix can effectively bridge the linguistic domain gap stemming fromEnglish-dominated LSD to URD in various languages. Without bells and whistles,FreeReal achieves average gains of 1.97%, 3.90%, 3.85%, and 4.56% in improvingthe performance of FCENet, PSENet, PANet, and DBNet methods, respectively,consistently outperforming previous pre-training methods by a substantialmargin across four public datasets.

Recent advances in Vision LanguageModels (VLMs) have shown a promising path in achieving this goal as itdemonstrates capabilities in perceiving and reasoning about multimodal inputs.However, VLMs are typically trained to predict textual output and it is an openresearch question about how to best utilize them in navigation. To solve MINT,we present Mobility VLA, a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action (VLA) navigationpolicy that combines the environment understanding and common sense reasoningpower of long-context VLMs and a robust low-level navigation policy based ontopological graphs. The high-level policy consists of a long-context VLM thattakes the demonstration tour video and the multimodal user instruction as inputto find the goal frame in the tour video. Next, a low-level policy uses thegoal frame and an offline constructed topological graph to generate robotactions at every timestep.

However, although artificial intelligence technologyhas been widely used in many aspects of life, its application in social mediacontent creation is still blank. To solve this problem, we propose a new promptword generation framework based on multi-modal information fusion, whichcombines multiple tasks including topic classification, sentiment analysis,scene recognition and keyword extraction to generate more comprehensive promptwords. Subsequently, we use a template containing a set of prompt words toguide ChatGPT to generate high-quality tweets. Furthermore, in the absence ofeffective and objective evaluation criteria in the field of content generation,we use the ChatGPT tool to evaluate the results generated by the algorithm,making large-scale evaluation of content generation algorithms possible.Evaluation results on extensive content generation demonstrate that our cueword generation framework generates higher quality content compared to manualmethods and other cueing techniques, while topic classification, sentimentanalysis, and scene recognition significantly enhance content clarity and itsconsistency with the image.</description><author>Haochen Xue, Chong Zhang, Chengzhi Liu, Fangyu Wu, Xiaobo Jin</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07771v1</guid></item><item><title>Ramsey Theorems for Trees and a General 'Private Learning Implies Online Learning' Theorem</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07765v1</link><description>This work continues to investigate the link between differentially private(DP) and online learning. Alon, Livni, Malliaris, and Moran (2019) showed thatfor binary concept classes, DP learnability of a given class implies that ithas a finite Littlestone dimension (equivalently, that it is online learnable).Their proof relies on a model-theoretic result by Hodges (1997), whichdemonstrates that any binary concept class with a large Littlestone dimensioncontains a large subclass of thresholds. In a follow-up work, Jung, Kim, andTewari (2020) extended this proof to multiclass PAC learning with a boundednumber of labels. Unfortunately, Hodges's result does not apply in othernatural settings such as multiclass PAC learning with an unbounded label space,and PAC learning of partial concept classes. This naturally raises the question of whether DP learnability continues toimply online learnability in more general scenarios: indeed, Alon, Hanneke,Holzman, and Moran (2021) explicitly leave it as an open question in thecontext of partial concept classes, and the same question is open in thegeneral multiclass setting. In this work, we give a positive answer to thesequestions showing that for general classification tasks, DP learnabilityimplies online learnability. Our proof reasons directly about Littlestonetrees, without relying on thresholds. We achieve this by establishing severalRamsey-type theorems for trees, which might be of independent interest.</description><author>Simone Fioravanti, Steve Hanneke, Shay Moran, Hilla Schefler, Iska Tsubari</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 15:43:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07765v1</guid></item><item><title>PosFormer: Recognizing Complex Handwritten Mathematical Expression with Position Forest Transformer</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07764v1</link><description>Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) has wide applicationsin human-machine interaction scenarios, such as digitized education andautomated offices. Recently, sequence-based models with encoder-decoderarchitectures have been commonly adopted to address this task by directlypredicting LaTeX sequences of expression images. However, these methods onlyimplicitly learn the syntax rules provided by LaTeX, which may fail to describethe position and hierarchical relationship between symbols due to complexstructural relations and diverse handwriting styles. To overcome thischallenge, we propose a position forest transformer (PosFormer) for HMER, whichjointly optimizes two tasks: expression recognition and position recognition,to explicitly enable position-aware symbol feature representation learning.Specifically, we first design a position forest that models the mathematicalexpression as a forest structure and parses the relative position relationshipsbetween symbols. Without requiring extra annotations, each symbol is assigned aposition identifier in the forest to denote its relative spatial position.Second, we propose an implicit attention correction module to accuratelycapture attention for HMER in the sequence-based decoder architecture.Extensive experiments validate the superiority of PosFormer, which consistentlyoutperforms the state-of-the-art methods 2.03%/1.22%/2.00%, 1.83%, and 4.62%gains on the single-line CROHME 2014/2016/2019, multi-line M2E, and complex MNEdatasets, respectively, with no additional latency or computational cost.

However, in practical scenarios, there are often domainvariations within the datasets, leading to derivative scenarios likesemi-supervised medical domain generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervisedmedical domain adaptation (UMDA). In this paper, we aim to develop a genericframework that masters all three tasks. We notice a critical shared challengeacross three scenarios: the explicit semantic knowledge for segmentationperformance and rich domain knowledge for generalizability exclusively exist inthe labeled set and unlabeled set respectively. Such discrepancy hindersexisting methods from effectively comprehending both types of knowledge undersemi-supervised settings. To tackle this challenge, we develop a Semantic &amp;Domain Knowledge Messenger (S&amp;D Messenger) which facilitates direct knowledgedelivery between the labeled and unlabeled set, and thus allowing the model tocomprehend both of them in each individual learning flow. Equipped with our S&amp;DMessenger, a naive pseudo-labeling method can achieve huge improvement on sixbenchmark datasets for SSMIS (+7.5%), UMDA (+5.6%), and Semi-MDG tasks(+1.14%), compared with state-of-the-art methods designed for specific tasks.</description><author>Qixiang Zhang, Haonan Wang, Xiaomeng Li</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 15:39:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07763v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning Spatial-Semantic Features for Robust Video Object Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07760v1</link><description>Tracking and segmenting multiple similar objects with complex or separateparts in long-term videos is inherently challenging due to the ambiguity oftarget parts and identity confusion caused by occlusion, background clutter,and long-term variations.

Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)have made remarkable strides in various tasks, particularly in single-pagedocument understanding (DU). However, their abilities on long-context DU remainan open problem. This work presents MMLongBench-Doc, a long-context,multi-modal benchmark comprising 1,062 expert-annotated questions. Distinctfrom previous datasets, it is constructed upon 130 lengthy PDF-formatteddocuments with an average of 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens. Towardscomprehensive evaluation, answers to these questions rely on pieces of evidencefrom (1) different sources (text, image, chart, table, and layout structure)and (2) various locations (i.e. page number). Moreover, 33.2% of the questionsare cross-page questions requiring evidence across multiple pages. 22.8% of thequestions are designed to be unanswerable for detecting potentialhallucinations. Experiments on 14 LVLMs demonstrate that long-context DUgreatly challenges current models. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o,achieves an F1 score of only 42.7%, while the second-best, GPT-4V, scores31.4%. Furthermore, 12 LVLMs (all except GPT-4o and GPT-4V) even present worseperformance than their LLM counterparts which are fed with lossy-parsed OCRdocuments.

Traditionally, we have a rich toolbox of geometryprocessing algorithms designed for polygonal meshes to analyze and operate onsurface geometry. However, neural representations are typically discretized andconverted into a mesh, before applying any geometry processing algorithm. Thisis unsatisfactory and, as we demonstrate, unnecessary. In this work, we proposea spherical neural surface representation (a spherical parametrization) forgenus-0 surfaces and demonstrate how to compute core geometric operatorsdirectly on this representation. Namely, we show how to construct the normalsand the first and second fundamental forms of the surface, and how to computethe surface gradient, surface divergence and Laplace Beltrami operator onscalar/vector fields defined on the surface. These operators, in turn, enableus to create geometry processing tools that act directly on the neuralrepresentations without any unnecessary meshing. We demonstrate illustrativeapplications in (neural) spectral analysis, heat flow and mean curvature flow,and our method shows robustness to isometric shape variations. We both proposetheoretical formulations and validate their numerical estimates. Bysystematically linking neural surface representations with classical geometryprocessing algorithms, we believe this work can become a key ingredient inenabling neural geometry processing.</description><author>Romy Williamson, Niloy J.

Current methods often focus onindividual operators and struggle with efficiency and scalability for largesystems. Here we introduce a novel deep learning model, SLEM (strictlylocalized equivariant message-passing) for predicting multiple quantumoperators, that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while dramatically improvingcomputational efficiency. SLEM's key innovation is its strict locality-baseddesign, constructing local, equivariant representations for quantum tensorswhile preserving physical symmetries. This enables complex many-body dependencewithout expanding the effective receptive field, leading to superior dataefficiency and transferability. Using an innovative SO(2) convolutiontechnique, SLEM reduces the computational complexity of high-order tensorproducts and is therefore capable of handling systems requiring the $f$ and $g$orbitals in their basis sets. We demonstrate SLEM's capabilities across diverse2D and 3D materials, achieving high accuracy even with limited training data.SLEM's design facilitates efficient parallelization, potentially extending DFTsimulations to systems with device-level sizes, opening new possibilities forlarge-scale quantum simulations and high-throughput materials discovery.</description><author>Zhanghao Zhouyin, Zixi Gan, Shishir Kumar Pandey, Linfeng Zhang, Qiangqiang Gu</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 15:20:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06053v2</guid></item><item><title>Phy-Diff: Physics-guided Hourglass Diffusion Model for Diffusion MRI Synthesis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03002v2</link><description>Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is an important neuroimaging technique with highacquisition costs.

However, safetrajectory planning requires not only object detection, but also the detectionof drivable areas and lane corridors. While first approaches consider anadvanced safety evaluation of object detection, the evaluation of lanedetection still lacks sufficient safety metrics. Similar to the safety metricsfor object detection, additional factors such as the semantics of the scenewith road type and road width, the detection range as well as the potentialcauses of missing detections, incorporated by vehicle speed, should beconsidered for the evaluation of lane detection. Therefore, we propose the LaneSafety Metric (LSM), which takes these factors into account and allows toevaluate the safety of lane detection systems by determining an easilyinterpretable safety score.

Inspired by group testing, theframework leverages overlapping groups of clients to identify the presence ofmalicious clients in the groups via a decoding operation. The clientsidentified as malicious are then removed from the model training, which isperformed over the remaining clients. By choosing the size, number, and overlapbetween groups, FedGT strikes a balance between privacy and security.Specifically, the server learns the aggregated model of the clients in eachgroup - vanilla federated learning and secure aggregation correspond to theextreme cases of FedGT with group size equal to one and the total number ofclients, respectively.

A recent work(i.e., Set-level guidance attack) indicates that augmenting image-text pairs toincrease AE diversity along the optimization path enhances the transferabilityof adversarial examples significantly.

We showthat these nuances can be captured by natural language explanations, andpropose a method to rescale ordinal annotations and explanations using LLMs.Specifically, we feed annotators' Likert ratings and corresponding explanationsinto an LLM and prompt it to produce a numeric score anchored in a scoringrubric.
