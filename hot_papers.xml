However, sparse and sometimes unverifiable rewardsmake temporal credit assignment extremely challenging. Recent work attempts tointegrate process supervision into agent learning but suffers from biasedannotation, reward hacking, high-variance from overly fine-grained signals orfailtures when state overlap is rare. We therefore introduce Online ProcessReward Learning (OPRL), a general credit-assignment strategy for agentic RLthat integrates seamlessly with standard on-policy algorithms without relyingon additional rollouts or explicit step labels. In OPRL, we optimize animplicit process reward model (PRM) alternately with the agent's policy totransform trajectory preferences into implicit step rewards through atrajectory-based DPO objective. These step rewards are then used to computestep-level advantages, which are combined with episode-level advantages fromoutcome rewards for policy update, creating a self-reinforcing loop.Theoretical findings guarantee that the learned step rewards are consistentwith trajectory preferences and act as potential-based shaping rewards,providing bounded gradients to stabilize training. Empirically, we evaluateOPRL on three distinct agent benmarks, including WebShop and VisualSokoban, aswell as open-ended social interactions with unverfiable rewards in SOTOPIA.Crucially, OPRL shows superior performance over frontier LLMs and strong RLbaselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with highersample-efficiency and lower variance during training. Further analysis alsodemonstrates the efficient exploration by OPRL using fewer actions,underscoring its potential for agentic learning in real-world scenarios.</description><author>Xiaoqian Liu, Ke Wang, Yuchuan Wu, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li, Junge Zhang, Jianbin Jiao</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 01:27:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19199v2</guid></item><item><title>UniAPL: A Unified Adversarial Preference Learning Framework for Instruct-Following</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25148v1</link><description>Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment.We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified PreferenceLearning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g.,Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., ReinforcementLearning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed dueto a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as thepolicy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledgebrittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between datasources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimizationproblem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novelframework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's.UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learningfrom mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, denseexpert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration,inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.Weevaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% onQwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming theteacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirmthat UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving bothstronger performance and better behavioral alignment.</description><author>FaQiang Qian, WeiKun Zhang, Ziliang Wang, Kang An, Xuhui Zheng, Liangjian Wen, Mengya Gao, Yong Dai, Yichao Wu</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 17:53:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25148v1</guid></item><item><title>Probing the Critical Point (CritPt) of AI Reasoning: a Frontier Physics Research Benchmark</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26574v2</link><description>While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities areprogressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can theyreason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontierphysics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicistswant LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics researchareas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular &amp; opticalphysics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statisticalphysics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulatefull-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems arenewly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiableanswer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized foradvanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while currentstate-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remainfar from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the bestaverage accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through therealistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a largedisconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics researchdemands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientificallygrounded AI tools.</description><author>Minhui Zhu, Minyang Tian, Xiaocheng Yang, Tianci Zhou, Penghao Zhu, Eli Chertkov, Shengyan Liu, Yufeng Du, Lifan Yuan, Ziming Ji, Indranil Das, Junyi Cao, Yufeng Du, Jinchen He, Yifan Su, Jiabin Yu, Yikun Jiang, Yujie Zhang, Chang Liu, Ze-Min Huang, Weizhen Jia, Xinan Chen, Peixue Wu, Yunkai Wang, Juntai Zhou, Yong Zhao, Farshid Jafarpour, Jessie Shelton, Aaron Young, John Bartolotta, Wenchao Xu, Yue Sun, Anjun Chu, Victor Colussi, Chris Akers, Nathan Brooks, Wenbo Fu, Christopher Wilson, Jinchao Zhao, Marvin Qi, Anqi Mu, Yubo Yang, Allen Zang, Yang Lyu, Peizhi Mai, Xuefei Guo, Luyu Gao, Ze Yang, Chi Xue, Dmytro Bandak, Ya√Ør Hein, Yonatan Kahn, Kevin Zhou, John Drew Wilson, Jarrod T.

However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy andtransmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, whichlimits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domainadaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-trainingparadigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapsecaused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with denseobjects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domainannotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Visionfoundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervisedframework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a VisionFoundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a "free lunch" manner,leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noisewhile improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, weintroduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM'ssemantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generatedpseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions fromlow-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality andquantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed,which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance andimage levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes andsimilarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment furtherenhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps.Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance insource-free remote sensing detection tasks.</description><author>Jianhong Han, Yupei Wang, Liang Chen</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 08:55:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11167v2</guid></item><item><title>Principle Methods of Rendering Non-equivalent Words from Uzbek and Dari to Russian and English</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15453v1</link><description>These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledgewhere linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicatemisunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent wordsbecause there are different local and internal words like food, garment,cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of thesewords do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to beworked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand theboth languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods ofrendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to thetarget language and this research has been completed using library-basedresearch. However, some of these non-equivalent words are alreadyprofessionally rendered to the target language but still there many other wordsto be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways andrules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the targetlanguage and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar &amp; Uzbek intoEnglish and Russian languages.</description><author>Mohammad Ibrahim Qani</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 11:18:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15453v1</guid></item><item><title>DoSReMC: Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification using Batch Normalization Adaptation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15452v1</link><description>Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been developed for the automaticrecognition of breast cancer using mammography images. However, theirperformance often declines when applied to data from different domains,primarily due to domain shift -- the variation in data distributions betweensource and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitabledeployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we presentDoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batchnormalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domaingeneralization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scalefull-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets -- including HCTP, a newlyintroduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset -- we conduct asystematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).Our results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domaindependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within thesame domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domainshift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fullyconnected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. Wefurther integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme,yielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC canbe readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverseclinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust andgeneralizable mammography classification systems.</description><author>Uƒüurcan Aky√ºz, Deniz Katircioglu-√ñzt√ºrk, Emre K.

Our innovative training recipestrategically captures knowledge from larger models via encoder-decoderinitialization and geometric embedding distillation. We improve modelrobustness and expressiveness with a spread-out regularizer, and ensuregeneralizability by merging checkpoints from varied, optimized mixtures.Evaluated on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across multilingual,English, and code domains, EmbeddingGemma (300M) achieves state-of-the-artresults. Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open,with fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to modelsdouble its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably,this lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embeddingoutputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency andhigh-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablationstudies exploring our key design choices.

After being trained onlarge text corpus, LLMs obtain the capability of extracting rich features fromtextual data. Such capability is potentially useful for the web servicerecommendation task, where the web users and services have intrinsic attributesthat can be described using natural language sentences and are useful forrecommendation. In this paper, we explore the possibility and practicality ofusing LLMs for web service recommendation. We propose the large language modelaided QoS prediction (llmQoS) model, which use LLMs to extract usefulinformation from attributes of web users and services via descriptivesentences. This information is then used in combination with the QoS values ofhistorical interactions of users and services, to predict QoS values for anygiven user-service pair. On the WSDream dataset, llmQoS is shown to overcomethe data sparsity issue inherent to the QoS prediction problem, and outperformscomparable baseline models consistently.</description><author>Huiying Liu, Zekun Zhang, Honghao Li, Qilin Wu, Yiwen Zhang</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 13:55:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02223v3</guid></item><item><title>Constraint Learning in Multi-Agent Dynamic Games from Demonstrations of Local Nash Interactions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19945v2</link><description>We present an inverse dynamic game-based algorithm to learn parametricconstraints from a given dataset of local generalized Nash equilibriuminteractions between multiple agents.

This novel neural network Banach spaceencompasses many classical multivariate function spaces, including certainSobolev spaces and the spectral Barron spaces. Notably, this Banach space alsoincludes functions that exhibit less classical regularity, such as those thatonly vary in a few directions. On bounded domains, it is well-established thatthe Gaussian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) strictly embeds into thisBanach space, demonstrating a clear gap between the Gaussian RKHS and theneural network Banach space. It turns out that when investigating these spaceson unbounded domains, e.g., all of $\mathbb{R}^d$, the story is fundamentallydifferent. We establish the following fundamental result: Certain functionsthat lie in the Gaussian RKHS have infinite norm in the neural network Banachspace. This provides a nontrivial gap between kernel methods and neuralnetworks by exhibiting functions that kernel methods easily represent, whereasneural networks cannot.</description><author>Akash Kumar, Rahul Parhi, Mikhail Belkin</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 04:46:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16331v2</guid></item><item><title>Diffusion Beats Autoregressive in Data-Constrained Settings</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15857v6</link><description>Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of largelanguage models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently,diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, thoughtheir advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, wesystematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-wheretraining involves repeated passes over limited data and find that theysignificantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce.Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validationloss and superior downstream performance. We find new scaling laws fordiffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical computethreshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. Finally, we explain whydiffusion models excel in this regime: their randomized masking objectiveimplicitly trains over a rich distribution of token orderings, acting as animplicit data augmentation that AR's fixed left-to-right factorization lacks.Our results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusionmodels offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

However, existing approaches struggleto effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-endedsettings where the number and nature of required skills are not known inadvance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework formulti-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method ismotivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domainsproduce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) whenoperating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the basemodel than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these twoobservations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,which nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our methodoperates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computingcosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the basemodel. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weightmatrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domaindrift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance thatincorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. Weextend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enablinginference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool. LoRAtorioachieves state-of-the-art performance, showing up to a 1.3% improvement inClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V pairwise evaluations, and generaliseseffectively to multiple latent diffusion models.</description><author>Niki Foteinopoulou, Ignas Budvytis, Stephan Liwicki</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 17:52:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11624v1</guid></item><item><title>Data Diversity as Implicit Regularization: How Does Diversity Shape the Weight Space of Deep Neural Networks?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14602v2</link><description>Data augmentation that introduces diversity into the input data has long beenused in training deep learning models. It has demonstrated benefits inimproving robustness and generalization, practically aligning well with otherregularization strategies such as dropout and weight decay. However, theunderlying mechanism of how diverse training data contributes to modelimprovements remains unknown. In this paper, we investigate the impact of datadiversity on the weight space of deep neural networks using Random MatrixTheory. Through spectral analysis and comparing models trained with dataaugmentation, dropout, and weight decay, we reveal that increasing datadiversity alters the weight spectral distribution similarly to otherregularization techniques, while displaying a pattern more closely aligned withdropout than with weight decay. Building on these insights, we propose a metricto explain and compare the benefits of diversity introduced by traditional dataaugmentations and those achieved through synthetic data.</description><author>Yang Ba, Michelle V.

Given the complexity, scale,and long-term nature of CCS operations, determining whether individualstakeholders can independently maximize their interests or whethercollaborative coalition agreements are needed remains a central question foreffective CCS project planning and management. CCS projects are oftenimplemented in geologically connected sites, where shared geological featuressuch as pressure space and reservoir pore capacity can lead to competitivebehavior among stakeholders. Furthermore, CO2 storage sites are often locatedin geologically mature basins that previously served as sites for hydrocarbonextraction or wastewater disposal in order to leverage existinginfrastructures, which makes unilateral optimization even more complicated andunrealistic. In this work, we propose a paradigm based on Markov games to quantitativelyinvestigate how different coalition structures affect the goals ofstakeholders. We frame this multi-stakeholder multi-site problem as amulti-agent reinforcement learning problem with safety constraints. Ourapproach enables agents to learn optimal strategies while compliant with safetyregulations. We present an example where multiple operators are injecting CO2into their respective project areas in a geologically connected basin. Toaddress the high computational cost of repeated simulations of high-fidelitymodels, a previously developed surrogate model based on the Embed-to-Control(E2C) framework is employed. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of theproposed framework in addressing optimal management of CO2 storage whenmultiple stakeholders with various objectives and goals are involved.</description><author>Jungang Chen, Seyyed A.

Thesestrategies, long refined in animation, function as multimodal scaffolds forattention, understanding, and attunement, supporting learning and comfort. Thisstructured design grammar is transferable to AI design. By reframing cinematicstorytelling and child development theory as design logic for AI, the paperoffers heuristics for AI that aligns with the cognitive stages and emotionalneeds of young users. The work contributes to design theory by showing howsensory, affective, and narrative techniques can inform developmentally attunedAI design. Future directions include empirical testing, cultural adaptation,and participatory co design.</description><author>Nomisha Kurian</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 17:35:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08670v3</guid></item><item><title>Controlling Multimodal LLMs via Reward-guided Decoding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11616v1</link><description>As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, itis becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. Inthis paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. Toachieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMsand demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our methodinvolves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guidethe MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models toindependently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model'soutput. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inferenceprocess in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance ofeach reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade offobject precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by givingcontrol over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user tocontrol the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree ofvisual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucinationbenchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLMinference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigationmethods.</description><author>Oscar Ma√±as, Pierluca D'Oro, Koustuv Sinha, Adriana Romero-Soriano, Michal Drozdzal, Aishwarya Agrawal</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 17:29:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11616v1</guid></item><item><title>Pretrained Conformers for Audio Fingerprinting and Retrieval</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11609v1</link><description>Conformers have shown great results in speech processing due to their abilityto capture both local and global interactions.

However, Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) for PAR often suffer from over-parameterization and high computationalcomplexity, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices.Traditional tensor-based compression methods typically factorize layers withoutadequately preserving the gradient direction during compression, leading toinefficient compression and a significant accuracy loss. In this work, wepropose a novel approach for determining the optimal ranks of low-rank layers,ensuring that the gradient direction of the compressed model closely alignswith that of the original model. This means that the compressed modeleffectively preserves the update direction of the full model, enabling moreefficient compression for PAR tasks. The proposed procedure optimizes thecompression ranks for each layer within the ALM model, followed by compressionusing CPD-EPC or truncated SVD.

We base our synthetic dataset on the SNLI dataset fortextual entailment. We take the premise text from SNLI as input prompts in agenerative image model, Stable Diffusion, creating an image to replace eachtextual premise. We evaluate our dataset both intrinsically and extrinsically.For extrinsic evaluation, we evaluate the validity of the generated images byusing them as training data for a visual entailment classifier based on CLIPfeature vectors. We find that synthetic training data only leads to a slightdrop in quality on SNLI-VE, with an F-score 0.686 compared to 0.703 whentrained on real data. We also compare the quality of our generated trainingdata to original training data on another dataset: SICK-VTE. Again, there isonly a slight drop in F-score: from 0.400 to 0.384.

However, without explicit control overmulti-view information exchange, they often fail to maintain cross-viewconsistency, leading to insufficient edits and blurry details. We introduceCoreEditor, a novel framework for consistent text-to-3D editing. The keyinnovation is a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism that enforcesprecise interactions between pixels expected to remain consistent throughoutthe diffusion denoising process. Beyond relying solely on geometric alignment,we further incorporate semantic similarity estimated during denoising, enablingmore reliable correspondence modeling and robust multi-view editing. Inaddition, we design a selective editing pipeline that allows users to choosepreferred results from multiple candidates, offering greater flexibility anduser control.

Unliketraditional parametric approaches, which assume a known functional form for thedrift, our goal here is to learn the entire drift function directly from datawithout strong structural assumptions, making it especially relevant inscientific disciplines where system dynamics are partially understood or highlycomplex. We cast the estimation problem as minimization of the penalizednegative log-likelihood functional over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space(RKHS). In the sparse observation regime, the presence of unobserved trajectorysegments makes the SDE likelihood intractable. To address this, we develop anExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that employs a novel Sequential MonteCarlo (SMC) method to approximate the filtering distribution and generate MonteCarlo estimates of the E-step objective. The M-step then reduces to a penalizedempirical risk minimization problem in the RKHS, whose minimizer is given by afinite linear combination of kernel functions via a generalized representertheorem. To control model complexity across EM iterations, we also develop ahybrid Bayesian variant of the algorithm that uses shrinkage priors to identifysignificant coefficients in the kernel expansion. We establish importanttheoretical convergence results for both the exact and approximate EMsequences. The resulting EM-SMC-RKHS procedure enables accurate estimation ofthe drift function of stochastic dynamical systems in low-data regimes and isbroadly applicable across domains requiring continuous-time modeling underobservational constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodthrough a series of numerical experiments.</description><author>Arnab Ganguly, Riten Mitra, Jinpu Zhou</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 17:01:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11597v1</guid></item><item><title>DashCam Video: A complementary low-cost data stream for on-demand forest-infrastructure system monitoring</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11591v1</link><description>Our study introduces a novel, low-cost, and reproducible framework forreal-time, object-level structural assessment and geolocation of roadsidevegetation and infrastructure with commonly available but underutilizeddashboard camera (dashcam) video data. We developed an end-to-end pipeline thatcombines monocular depth estimation, depth error correction, and geometrictriangulation to generate accurate spatial and structural data fromstreet-level video streams from vehicle-mounted dashcams. Depth maps were firstestimated using a state-of-the-art monocular depth model, then refined via agradient-boosted regression framework to correct underestimations, particularlyfor distant objects. The depth correction model achieved strong predictiveperformance (R2 = 0.92, MAE = 0.31 on transformed scale), significantlyreducing bias beyond 15 m. Further, object locations were estimated usingGPS-based triangulation, while object heights were calculated using pin holecamera geometry. Our method was evaluated under varying conditions of cameraplacement and vehicle speed. Low-speed vehicle with inside camera gave thehighest accuracy, with mean geolocation error of 2.83 m, and mean absoluteerror (MAE) in height estimation of 2.09 m for trees and 0.88 m for poles.

The agriculturalenvironment presents unique challenges due to its complexity, clutter, andocclusion. Additionally, fruit is physically attached to the plant, requiringprecise separation during harvesting. Selecting appropriate sensors andmodeling techniques is critical for obtaining reliable feedback and correctlyidentifying grasp states. This work investigates a set of key sensors, namelyinertial measurement units (IMUs), infrared (IR) reflectance, tension, tactilesensors, and RGB cameras, integrated into a compliant gripper to classify graspstates. We evaluate the individual contribution of each sensor and compare theperformance of two widely used classification models: Random Forest and LongShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our results demonstrate that a Random Forestclassifier, trained in a controlled lab environment and tested on real cherrytomato plants, achieved 100% accuracy in identifying slip, grasp failure, andsuccessful picks, marking a substantial improvement over baseline performance.Furthermore, we identify a minimal viable sensor combination, namely IMU andtension sensors that effectively classifies grasp states.

However, temporal understanding, which involves identifyingevent order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a corechallenge. Prior works emphasize positional encodings (PEs) as a key mechanismfor encoding temporal structure. Surprisingly, we find that removing ormodifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance oftemporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence whilepreserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain thisbehavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporalinformation is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal informationpathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frameattention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into thequery tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emergesfrom inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,which implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, wepropose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and atemporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on twobenchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches. To the best of ourknowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate video temporalunderstanding in VideoLMs, offering insights for future model improvement.</description><author>Yumeng Shi, Quanyu Long, Yin Wu, Wenya Wang</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 16:33:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11576v1</guid></item><item><title>TrajSV: A Trajectory-based Model for Sports Video Representations and Applications</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11569v1</link><description>Sports analytics has received significant attention from both academia andindustry in recent years. Despite the growing interest and efforts in thisfield, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement forsufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, atrajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip RepresentationNetwork (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The datapreprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sportsbroadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module tolearn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNetlearns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visualfeatures with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastiveloss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in anunsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast videodatasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e.,soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e.,sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The resultsdemonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports videoretrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement.

Recent advances in artificial intelligencehave sparked growing interest in automated psychological assessment, yet mostexisting approaches are constrained by their reliance on static text analysis,limiting their ability to capture deeper and more informative insights thatemerge through dynamic interaction and iterative questioning. Therefore, inthis paper, we propose a multi-agent framework for mental health evaluationthat simulates clinical doctor-patient dialogues, with specialized agentsassigned to questioning, adequacy evaluation, scoring, and updating. Weintroduce an adaptive questioning mechanism in which an evaluation agentassesses the adequacy of user responses to determine the necessity ofgenerating targeted follow-up queries to address ambiguity and missinginformation. Additionally, we employ a tree-structured memory in which the rootnode encodes the user's basic information, while child nodes (e.g., topic andstatement) organize key information according to distinct symptom categoriesand interaction turns. This memory is dynamically updated throughout theinteraction to reduce redundant questioning and further enhance the informationextraction and contextual tracking capabilities.

Building on research on fairness anddiscrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias --discrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-humananimals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)SpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moralevaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measurescomparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generationtasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. Inour benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarelycondemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. Onpsychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lowerexplicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often choseto save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is thatLLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacitieswere equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was describedas more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. Inopen-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalizedharm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.These findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive andmainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural normsaround animal exploitation. We argue that expanding AI fairness and alignmentframeworks to explicitly include non-human moral patients is essential forreducing these biases and preventing the entrenchment of speciesist attitudesin AI systems and the societies they influence.</description><author>Monika Jotautaitƒó, Lucius Caviola, David A.

First,SeamlessFlow introduces a data plane that decouples the RL trainer fromdiverse, complex agent implementations while sustaining high throughput. Acentral trajectory manager maintains complete interaction histories andsupports partial rollout, allowing rollout to pause for weight updates andresume seamlessly, keeping agents unaware of service interruptions. Second, wepropose a tag driven scheduling paradigm that abstracts hardware intocapability tagged resources, unifying colocated and disaggregatedarchitectures.

Inpractice, language model developers continue to rely on heuristic explorationsince no learning-based approach has emerged as a reliable solution. In thiswork, we propose to view the selection of training data mixtures as a black-boxhyperparameter optimization problem, for which Bayesian Optimization is awell-established class of appropriate algorithms. Firstly, we cast data mixturelearning as a sequential decision-making problem, in which we aim to find asuitable trade-off between the computational cost of training exploratory(proxy-) models and final mixture performance. Secondly, we systematicallyexplore the properties of transferring mixtures learned at a small scale tolarger-scale experiments, providing insights and highlighting opportunities forresearch at a modest scale. By proposing Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimizationas a suitable method in this common scenario, we introduce a natural frameworkto balance experiment cost with model fit, avoiding the risks of overfitting tosmaller scales while minimizing the number of experiments at high cost. Wepresent results for pre-training and instruction finetuning across modelsranging from 1 million to 7 billion parameters, varying from simplearchitectures to state-of-the-art models and benchmarks spanning dozens ofdatasets.

A growing body of works haveemerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However,these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to betrained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomalygeneration framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'sstrong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given anormal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic andnatural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents inother regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement(CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusionbased on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens inspecific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visualtokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomaliesneed to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We proposeSelf-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normalvisual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomaliesare coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisAdatasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and itsutility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performanceof various downstream anomaly inspection tasks.</description><author>Zuo Zuo, Jiahao Dong, Yanyun Qu, Zongze Wu</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 15:52:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11550v1</guid></item><item><title>PhysLab: A Benchmark Dataset for Multi-Granularity Visual Parsing of Physics Experiments</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06631v2</link><description>Visual parsing of images and videos is critical for a wide range ofreal-world applications.

Previous approaches leverage large vision language models(LVLMs) to encode object semantics into &lt;SEG&gt; tokens for mask prediction.However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inferenceand suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawinginspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduceVeason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning insegmentation.

To this end, we incorporate a holistic rewardmechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporalconsistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding.Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achievesstate-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art bysignificant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &amp;F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &amp;F in ReasonVOS),while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R).

However, their reliance on local interactions makesthem inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigatean adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a maliciousnode probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behaviorgradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting thelearning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, wepropose the Average Crossing (AC) algorithm--a fully decentralized mechanismfor duplicating RWs to prevent RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Ourtheoretical analysis establishes that (i) the RW population remains almostsurely bounded under AC and (ii) RW-based stochastic gradient descent remainsconvergent under AC, even in the presence of Pac-Man, with a quantifiabledeviation from the true optimum. Our extensive empirical results on bothsynthetic and real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings.Furthermore, they uncover a phase transition in the extinction probability as afunction of the duplication threshold.

While reinforcement learning (RL) can driveself-improvement in language models on verifiable tasks, some models exhibitsubstantial gains while others quickly plateau. For instance, we find thatQwen-2.5-3B far exceeds Llama-3.2-3B under identical RL training for the gameof Countdown. This discrepancy raises a critical question: what intrinsicproperties enable effective self-improvement? We introduce a framework toinvestigate this question by analyzing four key cognitive behaviors --verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining -- that bothexpert human problem solvers and successful language models employ. Our studyreveals that Qwen naturally exhibits these reasoning behaviors, whereas Llamainitially lacks them. In systematic experimentation with controlled behavioraldatasets, we find that priming Llama with examples containing these reasoningbehaviors enables substantial improvements during RL, matching or exceedingQwen's performance. Importantly, the presence of reasoning behaviors, ratherthan correctness of answers, proves to be the critical factor -- models primedwith incorrect solutions containing proper reasoning patterns achievecomparable performance to those trained on correct solutions. Finally,leveraging continued pretraining with OpenWebMath data, filtered to amplifyreasoning behaviors, enables the Llama model to match Qwen's self-improvementtrajectory. Our findings establish a fundamental relationship between initialreasoning behaviors and the capacity for improvement, explaining why somelanguage models effectively utilize additional computation while othersplateau.</description><author>Kanishk Gandhi, Ayush Chakravarthy, Anikait Singh, Nathan Lile, Noah D.

However, achieving efficient and high-accuracy imageclassification in resource-constrained computational environments remainschallenging. This study proposes a medical image classification method based onan improved ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture. Through structural optimization andloss function design, the proposed method enhances feature extractioncapability and classification performance while reducing computationalcomplexity. Specifically, the method introduces a dual global pooling (GlobalAverage Pooling and Global Max Pooling) feature fusion strategy into theConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to simultaneously preserve global statistical featuresand salient response information. A lightweight channel attention module,termed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve theadaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead.Additionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss functionto enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance.Under CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximumclassification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs,exhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values.

However, this efficiency often compromises theexpense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting theirability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. Toovercome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizeshighly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specializedenhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG)and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-stateinteraction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation whileincurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved trackingrobustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiplestate representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSErefines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitatesinformation exchange between these states and ensures the integration ofcomplementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt ahighly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD)design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters.Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficienttrackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracyand robustness.

In the infinite-width limit, NTKs can easily becomputed for most common architectures, yielding full analytic control over thetraining dynamics. However, at infinite width, important properties of trainingsuch as NTK evolution or feature learning are absent. Nevertheless, finitewidth effects can be included by computing corrections to the Gaussianstatistics at infinite width. We introduce Feynman diagrams for computingfinite-width corrections to NTK statistics. These dramatically simplify thenecessary algebraic manipulations and enable the computation of layer-wiserecursive relations for arbitrary statistics involving preactivations, NTKs andcertain higher-derivative tensors (dNTK and ddNTK) required to predict thetraining dynamics at leading order. We demonstrate the feasibility of ourframework by extending stability results for deep networks from preactivationsto NTKs and proving the absence of finite-width corrections for scale-invariantnonlinearities such as ReLU on the diagonal of the Gram matrix of the NTK. Wevalidate our results with numerical experiments.</description><author>Max Guillen, Philipp Misof, Jan E.

To overcome the limitations of inefficient manual inspectionand the suboptimal performance of existing deep learning models, particularlyfor small-target crack detection within complex backgrounds, this paperproposes YOLOv11-KW-TA-FP, a multi-task concrete crack detection andsegmentation model based on the YOLOv11n architecture. The proposed modelintegrates a three-stage optimization framework: (1) Embedding dynamicKernelWarehouse convolution (KWConv) within the backbone network to enhancefeature representation through a dynamic kernel sharing mechanism; (2)Incorporating a triple attention mechanism (TA) into the feature pyramid tostrengthen channel-spatial interaction modeling; and (3) Designing an FP-IoUloss function to facilitate adaptive bounding box regression penalization.Experimental validation demonstrates that the enhanced model achievessignificant performance improvements over the baseline, attaining 91.3%precision, 76.6% recall, and 86.4% mAP@50. Ablation studies confirm thesynergistic efficacy of the proposed modules. Furthermore, robustness testsindicate stable performance under conditions of data scarcity and noiseinterference.

While critical testing scenariogeneration has emerged as an appealing verification methodology, effectivelybalancing diversity and criticality remains a key challenge for existingmethods, particularly due to local optima entrapment in high-dimensionalscenario spaces. To address this limitation, we propose a dual-space guidedtesting framework that coordinates scenario parameter space and agent behaviorspace, aiming to generate testing scenarios considering diversity andcriticality. Specifically, in the scenario parameter space, a hierarchicalrepresentation framework combines dimensionality reduction andmulti-dimensional subspace evaluation to efficiently localize diverse andcritical subspaces. This guides dynamic coordination between two generationmodes: local perturbation and global exploration, optimizing critical scenarioquantity and diversity. Complementarily, in the agent behavior space,agent-environment interaction data are leveraged to quantify behavioralcriticality/diversity and adaptively support generation mode switching, forminga closed feedback loop that continuously enhances scenario characterization andexploration within the parameter space. Experiments show our framework improvescritical scenario generation by an average of 56.23\% and demonstrates greaterdiversity under novel parameter-behavior co-driven metrics when tested on fivedecision-making agents, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</description><author>Qitong Chu, Yufeng Yue, Danya Yao, Huaxin Pei</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 14:51:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11514v1</guid></item><item><title>Human-AI Experience in Integrated Development Environments: A Systematic Literature Review</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06195v2</link><description>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Integrated DevelopmentEnvironments (IDEs) is reshaping software development, fundamentally alteringhow developers interact with their tools.

Recent work has introducedself-explainable GNNs that generate explanations as part of training, improvingboth faithfulness and efficiency. Some of these models, such as ProtGNN andPGIB, learn class-specific prototypes, offering a potential pathway towardclass-level explanations. However, their evaluations focus solely oninstance-level explanations, leaving open the question of whether theseprototypes meaningfully generalize across instances of the same class. In thispaper, we introduce GraphOracle, a novel self-explainable GNN frameworkdesigned to generate and evaluate class-level explanations for GNNs. Our modeljointly learns a GNN classifier and a set of structured, sparse subgraphs thatare discriminative for each class. We propose a novel integrated training thatcaptures graph$\unicode{x2013}$subgraph$\unicode{x2013}$prediction dependenciesefficiently and faithfully, validated through a masking-based evaluationstrategy. This strategy enables us to retroactively assess whether priormethods like ProtGNN and PGIB deliver effective class-level explanations. Ourresults show that they do not. In contrast, GraphOracle achieves superiorfidelity, explainability, and scalability across a range of graphclassification tasks. We further demonstrate that GraphOracle avoids thecomputational bottlenecks of previous methods$\unicode{x2014}$like Monte CarloTree Search$\unicode{x2014}$by using entropy-regularized subgraph selection andlightweight random walk extraction, enabling faster and more scalable training.These findings position GraphOracle as a practical and principled solution forfaithful class-level self-explainability in GNNs.</description><author>Fanzhen Liu, Xiaoxiao Ma, Jian Yang, Alsharif Abuadbba, Kristen Moore, Surya Nepal, Cecile Paris, Quan Z.

Our methodology involvestraining an ensemble of convolutional neural network models, using onlineknowledge distillation to transfer insights from the ensemble to its members.This process aims to enhance the performance of each model within the ensemble,thereby elevating the overall performance of the ensemble itself.Post-training, any individual model within the ensemble can be deployed at testtime, as each member is trained to deliver comparable performance to theensemble. This is particularly beneficial in resource-constrained environments.Experimental results demonstrate that the knowledge-distilled individual modelperforms better than independently trained models. Our approach demonstratessuperior performance on both the \emph{International Skin ImagingCollaboration} 2018 and 2019 public benchmark datasets, surpassing currentstate-of-the-art results.

The primary contributionis a transparent and reproducible methodology that combines Automated MachineLearning (AutoML) and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) to identify andinterpret key risk factors associated with severe crashes. Using the JADBioAutoML platform, predictive models were constructed to distinguish betweensevere and non-severe crash outcomes.

A final Ridge Logistic Regression modelachieved an AUC-ROC of 85.6% on the training set and 84.9% on a hold-out testset, with 17 features consistently identified as the most influentialpredictors. Key features spanned demographic, environmental, vehicle, human,and operational categories, including location type, posted speed, minimumoccupant age, and pre-crash action.

In this work, we propose "Amending InherentInterpretability via Self-Supervised Masking" (AIM), a simple yet interestinglyeffective method that promotes the network's utilization of genuine featuresover spurious alternatives without requiring additional annotations. Inparticular, AIM uses features at multiple encoding stages to guide aself-supervised, sample-specific feature-masking process.

Accordingly,autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are viewed as vehicular systems capable ofperceiving their environment and executing pre-programmed tasks independentlyof external input. However, both research and real-world deploymentsincreasingly showcase vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond thisdefinition (including the SAE levels 0 to 5); Examples of this outpace includethe interaction with humans with natural language, goal adaptation, contextualreasoning, external tool use, and unseen ethical dilemma handling, largelyempowered by multi-modal large language models (LLMs). These developmentsreveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitiveand social capabilities needed for future human-centered mobility systems. Toaddress this gap, this paper introduces the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs),referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI systems to reason, adapt, andinteract within complex environments. This paper proposes the term AgVs andtheir distinguishing characteristics from conventional AuVs. It synthesizesrelevant advances in integrating LLMs and AuVs and highlights how AgVs mighttransform future mobility systems and ensure the systems are human-centered.The paper concludes by identifying key challenges in the development andgovernance of AgVs, and how they can play a significant role in future agentictransportation systems.</description><author>Jiangbo Yu</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 14:21:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04996v3</guid></item><item><title>Handwritten Text Recognition of Historical Manuscripts Using Transformer-Based Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11499v1</link><description>Historical handwritten text recognition (HTR) is essential for unlocking thecultural and scholarly value of archival documents, yet digitization is oftenhindered by scarce transcriptions, linguistic variation, and highly diversehandwriting styles.

To address this limita tion, we proposethe hierarchical graph feature enhancement (HGFE), a novel framework that integrates graph-based rea soning into CNNs toenhance both structural awareness and feature representation. HGFE builds two complementary levels of graph structures: intra-window graph convolution to cap ture local spatialdependencies and inter-window supernode interactions to model global semantic relationships. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive frequency modulation module that dynamically balances low-frequency and high-frequency signal propagation, preserving critical edge and texture information while mitigating over-smoothing. The proposed HGFE module is lightweight, end-to-end trainable, and can be seamlessly integrated into standard CNN backbone networks. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 (classification), PASCAL VOC, and VisDrone (detection), as well as CrackSeg and CarParts (segmentation), validated the effectiveness of the HGFE in improving structural representation and enhancing overall recognition performance.</description><author>Feiyue Zhao, Zhichao Zhang</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 14:19:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11497v1</guid></item><item><title>MultiAiTutor: Child-Friendly Educational Multilingual Speech Generation Tutor with LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08715v2</link><description>Generative speech models have demonstrated significant potential inpersonalizing teacher-student interactions, offering valuable real-worldapplications for language learning in children's education.

Existing methodsencode map and agent positions and decode future trajectories in Cartesiancoordinates. However, modeling the relationships between the ego vehicle andsurrounding traffic elements in Cartesian space can be suboptimal, as it doesnot naturally capture the varying influence of different elements based ontheir relative distances and directions. To address this limitation, we adoptthe Polar coordinate system, where positions are represented by radius andangle. This representation provides a more intuitive and effective way to modelspatial changes and relative relationships, especially in terms of distance anddirectional influence. Based on this insight, we propose Polaris, a novelmethod that operates entirely in Polar coordinates, distinguishing itself fromconventional Cartesian-based approaches. By leveraging the Polarrepresentation, this method explicitly models distance and direction variationsand captures relative relationships through dedicated encoding and refinementmodules, enabling more structured and spatially aware trajectory prediction andplanning. Extensive experiments on the challenging prediction (Argoverse 2) andplanning benchmarks (nuPlan) demonstrate that Polaris achieves state-of-the-artperformance.</description><author>Bozhou Zhang, Nan Song, Bingzhao Gao, Li Zhang</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 14:15:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11492v1</guid></item><item><title>Comparison of D-Wave Quantum Annealing and Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Sampling from a Probability Distribution of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10228v2</link><description>A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of samplingfrom Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generationof the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classicallytrained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to thecontrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for thenumber of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the correspondinglocal minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs hasbeen achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVsthan in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the twotechniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniqueswere (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, manypotentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even ifnot high, probability values, were found by only one of the two samplingtechniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less atlater than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of thetraining when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningfuldifferences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain thefailure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvementwhen using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potentialfor improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.</description><author>Abdelmoula El Yazizi, Samee U.

Existing methods primarily follow a perception-planning paradigm, whereperception and planning are executed sequentially within a fully differentiableframework for planning-oriented optimization. We further advance this paradigmthrough a perception-in-plan framework design, which integrates perception intothe planning process. This design facilitates targeted perception guided byevolving planning objectives over time, ultimately enhancing planningperformance. Building on this insight, we introduce VeteranAD, a coupledperception and planning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. Byincorporating multi-mode anchored trajectories as planning priors, theperception module is specifically designed to gather traffic elements alongthese trajectories, enabling comprehensive and targeted perception. Planningtrajectories are then generated based on both the perception results and theplanning priors. To make perception fully serve planning, we adopt anautoregressive strategy that progressively predicts future trajectories whilefocusing on relevant regions for targeted perception at each step. With thissimple yet effective design, VeteranAD fully unleashes the potential ofplanning-oriented end-to-end methods, leading to more accurate and reliabledriving behavior. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive datasetsdemonstrate that our VeteranAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description><author>Bozhou Zhang, Jingyu Li, Nan Song, Li Zhang</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 14:05:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11488v1</guid></item><item><title>Introducing Unbiased Depth into 2D Gaussian Splatting for High-accuracy Surface Reconstruction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06587v3</link><description>Recently, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has demonstrated superior geometryreconstruction quality than the popular 3DGS by using 2D surfels to approximatethin surfaces. However, it falls short when dealing with glossy surfaces,resulting in visible holes in these areas. We find that the reflectiondiscontinuity causes the issue. To fit the jump from diffuse to specularreflection at different viewing angles, depth bias is introduced in theoptimized Gaussian primitives. To address that, we first replace the depthdistortion loss in 2DGS with a novel depth convergence loss, which imposes astrong constraint on depth continuity. Then, we rectify the depth criterion indetermining the actual surface, which fully accounts for all the intersectingGaussians along the ray. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations acrossvarious datasets reveal that our method significantly improves reconstructionquality, with more complete and accurate surfaces than 2DGS.

However, CLIP's alignment withobject categories instead of their anomalous states limits its effectivenessfor anomaly detection. To address this limitation, we propose AFR-CLIP, aCLIP-based anomaly feature rectification framework. AFR-CLIP first performsimage-guided textual rectification, embedding the implicit defect informationfrom the image into a stateless prompt that describes the object categorywithout indicating any anomalous state. The enriched textual embeddings arethen compared with two pre-defined stateful (normal or abnormal) embeddings,and their text-on-text similarity yields the anomaly map that highlightsdefective regions.

Due to the lack of fine-grainedbehavior-level annotations, detecting specific behavior-level anomalies withinuser behavior sequences is challenging. Unsupervised methods face high falsepositive rates and miss rates due to the inherent ambiguity between normal andanomalous behaviors. In this work, we instead introduce weak labels of behaviorsequences, which have lower annotation costs, i.e., the training labels(anomalous or normal) are at sequence-level instead of behavior-level, toenhance the detection capability for behavior-level anomalies by learningdiscriminative features. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework calledRobust Multi-sphere Learning (RMSL). RMSL uses multiple hyper-spheres torepresent the normal patterns of behaviors. Initially, a one-class classifieris constructed as a good anomaly-supervision-free starting point. Building onthis, using multiple instance learning and adaptive behavior-levelself-training debiasing based on model prediction confidence, the frameworkfurther refines hyper-spheres and feature representations using weaksequence-level labels. This approach enhances the model's ability todistinguish between normal and anomalous behaviors. Extensive experimentsdemonstrate that RMSL significantly improves the performance of behavior-levelinsider threat detection.</description><author>Yang Wang, Yaxin Zhao, Xinyu Jiao, Sihan Xu, Xiangrui Cai, Ying Zhang, Xiaojie Yuan</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 13:36:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11472v1</guid></item><item><title>CoFi: A Fast Coarse-to-Fine Few-Shot Pipeline for Glomerular Basement Membrane Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11469v1</link><description>Accurate segmentation of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in electronmicroscopy (EM) images is fundamental for quantifying membrane thickness andsupporting the diagnosis of various kidney diseases. While supervised deeplearning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance onextensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinicalworkflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but oftenstruggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. Inthis study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shotsegmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi firsttrains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images toproduce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automaticallyprocessed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning,which are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. Theproposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dicecoefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate thatCoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associatedwith conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentationresults.

Traditional sketches provide only coarse estimates under strictmemory constraints. Although some learning-augmented methods have emergedrecently, they typically rely on offline training with real frequencies or/andlabels, which are often unavailable. Moreover, these methods suffer from slowupdate speeds, limiting their suitability for real-time processing despiteoffering only marginal accuracy improvements. To overcome these challenges, wepropose UCL-sketch, a practical learning-based paradigm for per-key frequencyestimation. Our design introduces two key innovations: (i) an online trainingmechanism based on equivalent learning that requires no ground truth (GT), and(ii) a highly scalable architecture leveraging logically structured estimationbuckets to scale to real-world data stream. The UCL-sketch, which utilizescompressive sensing (CS), converges to an estimator that provably yields aerror bound far lower than that of prior works, without sacrificing the speedof processing. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasetsdemonstrate that our approach outperforms previously proposed approachesregarding per-key accuracy and distribution. Notably, under extremely tightmemory budgets, its quality almost matches that of an (infeasible) omniscientoracle.

In this work, we conduct anempirical investigation into the privacy-explainability trade-off in thecontext of NLP, guided by the popular overarching methods of DifferentialPrivacy (DP) and Post-hoc Explainability. Our findings include a view into theintricate relationship between privacy and explainability, which is formed by anumber of factors, including the nature of the downstream task and choice ofthe text privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight thepotential for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize ourfindings in a collection of practical recommendations for future work at thisimportant intersection.</description><author>Mahdi Dhaini, Stephen Meisenbacher, Ege Erdogan, Florian Matthes, Gjergji Kasneci</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 13:25:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10482v2</guid></item><item><title>Thyme: Think Beyond Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11630v1</link><description>Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept,recent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in thereasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoningtasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currentlyoffers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can performdiverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoningcapabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in thisdirection by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm forenabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches byautonomously generating and executing diverse image processing andcomputational operations via executable code. This approach not onlyfacilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply theseoperations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manuallycollect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase thelearning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative PolicyOptimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that appliesdistinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoningexploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimentalanalysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoningtasks.</description><author>Yi-Fan Zhang, Xingyu Lu, Shukang Yin, Chaoyou Fu, Wei Chen, Xiao Hu, Bin Wen, Kaiyu Jiang, Changyi Liu, Tianke Zhang, Haonan Fan, Kaibing Chen, Jiankang Chen, Haojie Ding, Kaiyu Tang, Zhang Zhang, Liang Wang, Fan Yang, Tingting Gao, Guorui Zhou</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 17:59:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11630v1</guid></item></channel></rss>
