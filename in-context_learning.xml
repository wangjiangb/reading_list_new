Yet, despite the fact that the amount of training data isgigantic, they still struggle with translating rare words, particularly forlow-resource languages. Even worse, it is usually unrealistic to retrieverelevant demonstrations for in-context learning with low-resource languages onLLMs, which restricts the practical use of LLMs for translation -- how shouldwe mitigate this problem? To this end, we present a novel method, CoD, whichaugments LLMs with prior knowledge with the chains of multilingual dictionariesfor a subset of input words to elicit translation abilities for LLMs. Extensiveexperiments indicate that augmenting ChatGPT with CoD elicits large gains by upto 13x chrF++ points for MNMT (3.08 to 42.63 for English to Serbian written inCyrillic script) on FLORES-200 full devtest set. We further demonstrate theimportance of chaining the multilingual dictionaries, as well as thesuperiority of CoD to few-shot demonstration for low-resource languages.</description><author>Hongyuan Lu, Haoran Yang, Haoyang Huang, Dongdong Zhang, Wai Lam, Furu Wei</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 09:53:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06575v5</guid></item><item><title>Video In-context Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07356v1</link><description>In-context learning for vision data has been underexplored compared with thatin natural language.

These are challenges that current tabular deeplearning approaches have not fully tackled. Here we introduce GenerativeTabular Learning (GTL), a novel framework that integrates the advancedfunctionalities of large language models (LLMs)-such as prompt-based zero-shotgeneralization and in-context learning-into tabular deep learning. GTLcapitalizes on the pre-training of LLMs on diverse tabular data, enhancingtheir understanding of domain-specific knowledge, numerical sequences, andstatistical dependencies critical for accurate predictions. Our empirical studyspans 384 public datasets, rigorously analyzing GTL's convergence and scalingbehaviors and assessing the impact of varied data templates. The GTL-enhancedLLaMA-2 model demonstrates superior zero-shot and in-context learningcapabilities across numerous classification and regression tasks. Notably, itachieves this without fine-tuning, outperforming traditional methods andrivaling state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 in certain cases. Through GTL, wenot only foster a deeper integration of LLMs' sophisticated abilities intotabular data comprehension and application but also offer a new trainingresource and a test bed for LLMs to enhance their ability to comprehend tabulardata.

We introduce a novel weightconstruction for SSMs, enabling them to predict the next state of any dynamicalsystem after observing previous states without parameter fine-tuning. This isaccomplished by extending the HiPPO framework to demonstrate that continuousSSMs can approximate the derivative of any input signal. Specifically, we findan explicit weight construction for continuous SSMs and provide an asymptoticerror bound on the derivative approximation. The discretization of thiscontinuous SSM subsequently yields a discrete SSM that predicts the next state.Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our parameterization empirically.This work should be an initial step toward understanding how sequence modelsbased on SSMs learn in context.</description><author>Federico Arangath Joseph, Kilian Haefeli, Noah Liniger, Caglar Gulcehre</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 15:56:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09375v1</guid></item><item><title>Can large language models explore in-context?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15371v2</link><description>We investigate the extent to which contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs)can engage in exploration, a core capability in reinforcement learning anddecision making. We focus on native performance of existing LLMs, withouttraining interventions. We deploy LLMs as agents in simple multi-armed banditenvironments, specifying the environment description and interaction historyentirely in-context, i.e., within the LLM prompt. We experiment with GPT-3.5,GPT-4, and Llama2, using a variety of prompt designs, and find that the modelsdo not robustly engage in exploration without substantial interventions: i)Across all of our experiments, only one configuration resulted in satisfactoryexploratory behavior: GPT-4 with chain-of-thought reasoning and an externallysummarized interaction history, presented as sufficient statistics; ii) Allother configurations did not result in robust exploratory behavior, includingthose with chain-of-thought reasoning but unsummarized history. Although thesefindings can be interpreted positively, they suggest that externalsummarization -- which may not be possible in more complex settings -- isimportant for obtaining desirable behavior from LLM agents. We conclude thatnon-trivial algorithmic interventions, such as fine-tuning or dataset curation,may be required to empower LLM-based decision making agents in complexsettings.</description><author>Akshay Krishnamurthy, Keegan Harris, Dylan J.

Recent studies have shown thatsuch data aids multimodal in-context learning and maintains the capabilities oflarge language models during multimodal fine-tuning. However, the limited scaleand diversity of current image-text interleaved data restrict the developmentof multimodal large language models. In this paper, we introduce OmniCorpus, a10 billion-scale image-text interleaved dataset. Using an efficient dataengine, we filter and extract large-scale high-quality documents, which contain8.6 billion images and 1,696 billion text tokens. Compared to counterparts(e.g., MMC4, OBELICS), our dataset 1) has 15 times larger scales whilemaintaining good data quality; 2) features more diverse sources, including bothEnglish and non-English websites as well as video-centric websites; 3) is moreflexible, easily degradable from an image-text interleaved format to pure textcorpus and image-text pairs. Through comprehensive analysis and experiments, wevalidate the quality, usability, and effectiveness of the proposed dataset. Wehope this could provide a solid data foundation for future multimodal modelresearch.

In response, we introduce SpreadsheetLLM, pioneering anefficient encoding method designed to unleash and optimize LLMs' powerfulunderstanding and reasoning capability on spreadsheets. Initially, we propose avanilla serialization approach that incorporates cell addresses, values, andformats. However, this approach was limited by LLMs' token constraints, makingit impractical for most applications. To tackle this challenge, we developSheetCompressor, an innovative encoding framework that compresses spreadsheetseffectively for LLMs. It comprises three modules: structural-anchor-basedcompression, inverse index translation, and data-format-aware aggregation. Itsignificantly improves performance in spreadsheet table detection task,outperforming the vanilla approach by 25.6% in GPT4's in-context learningsetting. Moreover, fine-tuned LLM with SheetCompressor has an averagecompression ratio of 25 times, but achieves a state-of-the-art 78.9% F1 score,surpassing the best existing models by 12.3%. Finally, we propose Chain ofSpreadsheet for downstream tasks of spreadsheet understanding and validate in anew and demanding spreadsheet QA task. We methodically leverage the inherentlayout and structure of spreadsheets, demonstrating that SpreadsheetLLM ishighly effective across a variety of spreadsheet tasks.</description><author>Yuzhang Tian, Jianbo Zhao, Haoyu Dong, Junyu Xiong, Shiyu Xia, Mengyu Zhou, Yun Lin, José Cambronero, Yeye He, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 06:34:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09025v1</guid></item><item><title>RB-SQL: A Retrieval-based LLM Framework for Text-to-SQL</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08273v2</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning have significantlyimproved the performance of text-to-SQL task.

This task has garneredincreased attention due to the widespread dissemination and harmful impact offake news on social media. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstratedcompetitive performance with the help of their rich prior knowledge andexcellent in-context learning abilities. However, existing methods facesignificant limitations, such as the Understanding Ambiguity and InformationScarcity, which significantly undermine the potential of LLMs. To address theseshortcomings, we propose a Dual-perspective Augmented Fake News Detection(DAFND) model, designed to enhance LLMs from both inside and outsideperspectives. Specifically, DAFND first identifies the keywords of each newsarticle through a Detection Module. Subsequently, DAFND creatively designs anInvestigation Module to retrieve inside and outside valuable informationconcerning to the current news, followed by another Judge Module to derive itsrespective two prediction results. Finally, a Determination Module furtherintegrates these two predictions and derives the final result. Extensiveexperiments on two publicly available datasets show the efficacy of ourproposed method, particularly in low-resource settings.</description><author>Ye Liu, Jiajun Zhu, Kai Zhang, Haoyu Tang, Yanghai Zhang, Xukai Liu, Qi Liu, Enhong Chen</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 03:15:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08952v1</guid></item><item><title>DG-PIC: Domain Generalized Point-In-Context Learning for Point Cloud Understanding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08801v1</link><description>Recent point cloud understanding research suffers from performance drops onunseen data, due to the distribution shifts across different domains. Whilerecent studies use Domain Generalization (DG) techniques to mitigate this bylearning domain-invariant features, most are designed for a single task andneglect the potential of testing data. Despite In-Context Learning (ICL)showcasing multi-task learning capability, it usually relies on high-qualitycontext-rich data and considers a single dataset, and has rarely been studiedin point cloud understanding. In this paper, we introduce a novel, practical,multi-domain multi-task setting, handling multiple domains and multiple taskswithin one unified model for domain generalized point cloud understanding. Tothis end, we propose Domain Generalized Point-In-Context Learning (DG-PIC) thatboosts the generalizability across various tasks and domains at testing time.In particular, we develop dual-level source prototype estimation that considersboth global-level shape contextual and local-level geometrical structures forrepresenting source domains and a dual-level test-time feature shiftingmechanism that leverages both macro-level domain semantic information andmicro-level patch positional relationships to pull the target data closer tothe source ones during the testing. Our DG-PIC does not require any modelupdates during the testing and can handle unseen domains and multiple tasks,\textit{i.e.,} point cloud reconstruction, denoising, and registration, withinone unified model. We also introduce a benchmark for this new setting.Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DG-PIC outperforms state-of-the-arttechniques significantly.</description><author>Jincen Jiang, Qianyu Zhou, Yuhang Li, Xuequan Lu, Meili Wang, Lizhuang Ma, Jian Chang, Jian Jun Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 18:21:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08801v1</guid></item><item><title>GPT Sonograpy: Hand Gesture Decoding from Forearm Ultrasound Images via VLM</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10870v1</link><description>Large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as the Generative Pre-trainedTransformer 4-omni (GPT-4o), are emerging multi-modal foundation models whichhave great potential as powerful artificial-intelligence (AI) assistance toolsfor a myriad of applications, including healthcare, industrial, and academicsectors.

One approach to address this issueis to provide citations to relevant sources alongside generated content,enhancing the verifiability of generations. However, citing passages accuratelyin answers remains a substantial challenge. This paper proposes aweakly-supervised fine-tuning method leveraging factual consistency models(FCMs). Our approach alternates between generating texts with citations andsupervised fine-tuning with FCM-filtered citation data. Focused learning isintegrated into the objective, directing the fine-tuning process to emphasisethe factual unit tokens, as measured by an FCM.

These capabilities, referredto as "emergent abilities," have been a driving force in discussions regardingthe potentials and risks of language models. A key challenge in evaluatingemergent abilities is that they are confounded by model competencies that arisethrough alternative prompting techniques, including in-context learning, whichis the ability of models to complete a task based on a few examples. We presenta novel theory that explains emergent abilities, taking into account theirpotential confounding factors, and rigorously substantiate this theory throughover 1000 experiments. Our findings suggest that purported emergent abilitiesare not truly emergent, but result from a combination of in-context learning,model memory, and linguistic knowledge. Our work is a foundational step inexplaining language model performance, providing a template for their efficientuse and clarifying the paradox of their ability to excel in some instanceswhile faltering in others.

This hasachieved breakthrough performance on language tasks such as translation,summarization, and question-answering. Furthermore, in addition to theseassociative "System 1" tasks, recent advances in Chain-of-thought promptlearning have demonstrated strong "System 2" reasoning abilities, answering aquestion in the field of artificial general intelligence whether LLMs canreason. The field started with the question whether LLMs can solve grade schoolmath word problems. This paper reviews the rapidly expanding field ofprompt-based reasoning with LLMs. Our taxonomy identifies different ways togenerate, evaluate, and control multi-step reasoning. We provide an in-depthcoverage of core approaches and open problems, and we propose a research agendafor the near future. Finally, we highlight the relation between reasoning andprompt-based learning, and we discuss the relation between reasoning,sequential decision processes, and reinforcement learning.

While these models have shown unprecedented performance in manydownstream zero-shot tasks (eg image captioning, question answers, etc), stilllittle emphasis has been put on transferring one of the core LLM capability ofIn-Context Learning (ICL). ICL is the ability of a model to reason about adownstream task with a few examples demonstrations embedded in the prompt. Inthis work, through extensive evaluations, we find that the state-of-the-artVLMs somewhat lack the ability to follow ICL instructions. In particular, wediscover that even models that underwent large-scale mixed modalitypre-training and were implicitly guided to make use of interleaved image andtext information (intended to consume helpful context from multiple images)under-perform when prompted with few-shot demonstrations (in an ICL way),likely due to their lack of direct ICL instruction tuning. To enhance the ICLabilities of the present VLM, we propose a simple yet surprisingly effectivemulti-turn curriculum-based learning methodology with effective data mixes,leading up to a significant 21.03% (and 11.3% on average) ICL performance boostover the strongest VLM baselines and a variety of ICL benchmarks.

While previous studies suggest LLMs canencode knowledge within their parameters, the amount of parametric knowledgealone is not sufficient to evaluate their effectiveness as KBs. This studydefines criteria that a reliable LLM-as-KB should meet, focusing on factualityand consistency, and covering both seen and unseen knowledge. We developseveral metrics based on these criteria and use them to evaluate 26 popularLLMs, while providing a comprehensive analysis of the effects of model size,instruction tuning, and in-context learning (ICL).

Traditional methods heavily rely on representation learningthat is trained on a large amount of video data. However, a major challengearises from the difficulty of obtaining effective video representation. Thisdifficulty stems from the complex and variable nature of human activities,which contrasts with the limited availability of data. In this study, weintroduce PALM, an approach that tackles the task of long-term actionanticipation, which aims to forecast forthcoming sequences of actions over anextended period. Our method PALM incorporates an action recognition model totrack previous action sequences and a vision-language model to articulaterelevant environmental details. By leveraging the context provided by thesepast events, we devise a prompting strategy for action anticipation using largelanguage models (LLMs). Moreover, we implement maximal marginal relevance forexample selection to facilitate in-context learning of the LLMs. Ourexperimental results demonstrate that PALM surpasses the state-of-the-artmethods in the task of long-term action anticipation on the Ego4D benchmark. Wefurther validate PALM on two additional benchmarks, affirming its capacity forgeneralization across intricate activities with different sets of taxonomies.</description><author>Sanghwan Kim, Daoji Huang, Yongqin Xian, Otmar Hilliges, Luc Van Gool, Xi Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2024 10:31:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17944v2</guid></item><item><title>Learning-From-Mistakes Prompting for Indigenous Language Translation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13343v1</link><description>Using large language models, this paper presents techniques to improveextremely low-resourced indigenous language translations.

We introduceQuRating, a method for selecting pre-training data that can capture humanintuitions about data quality. In this paper, we investigate four qualities -writing style, required expertise, facts &amp; trivia, and educational value - andfind that LLMs are able to discern these qualities, especially when makingpairwise judgments of texts. We train a QuRater model to learn scalar ratingsfrom pairwise judgments, and use it to annotate a 260B training corpus withquality ratings for each of the four criteria. In our experiments, we select30B tokens according to the different quality ratings and train 1.3B-parameterlanguage models on the selected data. We find that it is important to balancequality and diversity. When we sample using quality ratings as logits overdocuments, our models obtain lower perplexity and stronger in-context learningperformance than baselines. Our best model is based on educational value andperforms similarly to a model trained with uniform sampling for 50% more steps.Beyond data selection, we use the quality ratings to construct a trainingcurriculum which improves performance without changing the training dataset.

An Investigation into Limitations and Scalability</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15720v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for many AIproblems and exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities.Compositional ability, solving unseen complex tasks that combine two or moresimple tasks, is an essential reasoning ability for Artificial GeneralIntelligence. Despite LLM's tremendous success, how they approach compositetasks, especially those not encountered during the pretraining phase, remainsan open question and largely ununderstood. In this study, we delve into the ICLcapabilities of LLMs on composite tasks, with only simple tasks as in-contextexamples. We develop a test suite of composite tasks that include linguisticand logical challenges and perform empirical studies across different LLMfamilies. We observe that models exhibit divergent behaviors: (1) For simplercomposite tasks that apply distinct mapping mechanisms to different inputsegments, the models demonstrate decent compositional ability, while scaling upthe model enhances this ability; (2) for more complex composite tasks thatinvolving reasoning multiple steps, where each step represent one task, modelstypically underperform, and scaling up generally provide no improvements. Weoffer theoretical analysis in a simplified setting, explaining that modelsexhibit compositional capability when the task handles different input partsseparately. We believe our work sheds new light on the capabilities of LLMs insolving composite tasks regarding the nature of the tasks and model scale.

The resulting models can be generalizedseamlessly to novel segmentation tasks, significantly reducing the labeling andtraining costs compared with conventional pipelines. However, in-contextsegmentation is more challenging than classic ones requiring the model to learnsegmentation rules conditioned on a few samples. Unlike previous work withad-hoc or non-end-to-end designs, we propose SEGIC, an end-to-endsegment-in-context framework built upon a single vision foundation model (VFM).In particular, SEGIC leverages the emergent correspondence within VFM tocapture dense relationships between target images and in-context samples. Assuch, information from in-context samples is then extracted into three types ofinstructions, i.e. geometric, visual, and meta instructions, serving asexplicit conditions for the final mask prediction. SEGIC is a straightforwardyet effective approach that yields state-of-the-art performance on one-shotsegmentation benchmarks.

By instructing LLMsusing few-shot demonstrative examples, ICL enables them to perform a wide rangeof tasks without updating millions of parameters. However, the precisecontributions of demonstrations towards improving end-task performance have notbeen thoroughly investigated in recent analytical studies. In this paper, weempirically decompose the overall performance of ICL into three dimensions,label space, format, and discrimination, and we evaluate four general-purposeLLMs across a diverse range of tasks. Counter-intuitively, we find that thedemonstrations have a marginal impact on provoking discriminative knowledge oflanguage models. However, ICL exhibits significant efficacy in regulating thelabel space and format, which helps LLMs respond to desired label words. Wethen demonstrate that this ability functions similar to detailed instructionsfor LLMs to follow. We additionally provide an in-depth analysis of themechanism of retrieval helping with ICL. Our findings demonstrate thatretrieving the semantically similar examples notably boosts the model'sdiscriminative capability. However, we also observe a trade-off in selectinggood in-context examples regarding label diversity.</description><author>Quanyu Long, Yin Wu, Wenya Wang, Sinno Jialin Pan</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 12:28:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07546v2</guid></item><item><title>Evolutionary Prompt Design for LLM-Based Post-ASR Error Correction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16370v1</link><description>Building upon the strength of modern large language models (LLMs), generativeerror correction (GEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm that can elevate theperformance of modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems.

Although CLIP performs well, the typical direct latentfeature alignment lacks clarity in its representation and similarity scores. Onthe other hand, lexical representation, a vector whose element represents thesimilarity between the sample and a word from the vocabulary, is a naturalsparse representation and interpretable, providing exact matches for individualwords. However, lexical representations is difficult to learn due to noground-truth supervision and false-discovery issues, and thus requires complexdesign to train effectively. In this paper, we introduce LexVLA, a moreinterpretable VLA framework by learning a unified lexical representation forboth modalities without complex design. We use DINOv2 as our visual model forits local-inclined features and Llama 2, a generative language model, toleverage its in-context lexical prediction ability. To avoid the falsediscovery, we propose an overuse penalty to refrain the lexical representationfrom falsely frequently activating meaningless words. We demonstrate that thesetwo pre-trained uni-modal models can be well-aligned by fine-tuning on modestmulti-modal dataset and avoid intricate training configurations. On cross-modalretrieval benchmarks, LexVLA, trained on the CC-12M multi-modal dataset,outperforms baselines fine-tuned on larger datasets (e.g., YFCC15M) and thosetrained from scratch on even bigger datasets (e.g., 1.1B data, includingCC-12M).

In this paper, westudy the behavior of transformers on data drawn from \kth Markov processes,where the conditional distribution of the next symbol in a sequence depends onthe previous $k$ symbols observed. We observe a surprising phenomenonempirically which contradicts previous findings: when trained for sufficientlylong, a transformer with a fixed depth and $1$ head per layer is able toachieve low test loss on sequences drawn from \kth Markov sources, even as $k$grows. Furthermore, this low test loss is achieved by the transformer's abilityto represent and learn the in-context conditional empirical distribution. Onthe theoretical side, our main result is that a transformer with a single headand three layers can represent the in-context conditional empiricaldistribution for \kth Markov sources, concurring with our empiricalobservations.

This scarcity usually results inpoor performance of machine learning models on such data. Data augmentation, acommon strategy for performance improvement in vision and language tasks,typically underperforms for tabular data due to the lack of explicit symmetriesin the input space. To overcome this challenge, we introduce TabMDA, a novelmethod for manifold data augmentation on tabular data. This method utilises apre-trained in-context model, such as TabPFN, to map the data into an embeddingspace. TabMDA performs label-invariant transformations by encoding the datamultiple times with varied contexts. This process explores the learnedembedding space of the underlying in-context models, thereby enlarging thetraining dataset. TabMDA is a training-free method, making it applicable to anyclassifier. We evaluate TabMDA on five standard classifiers and observesignificant performance improvements across various tabular datasets. Ourresults demonstrate that TabMDA provides an effective way to leverageinformation from pre-trained in-context models to enhance the performance ofdownstream classifiers.

Currentresearch mainly focuses on selecting demonstration samples, preassuming theclass name to be the label word when creating sample-label pairs. However, thechoice of label words is crucial for ICL performance. In addition, we observethat using a single class name in demonstration may not yield optimal results.In this paper, we propose to use multiple label words in one sample-label pairto enhance ICL performance. Further, we select and order sample-label pairsbased on LLM's output distribution, aiming to optimize the demonstrationexamples from both the samples' and labels' perspectives.

We present AgEval, a benchmark comprising 12 diverse plant stressphenotyping tasks, to evaluate these models' capabilities. Our study assesseszero-shot and few-shot in-context learning performance of state-of-the-artmodels, including Claude, GPT, Gemini, and LLaVA. Results show significantperformance improvements with few-shot learning, with F1 scores increasing from46.24% to 73.37% in 8-shot identification for the best-performing model.Few-shot examples from other classes in the dataset have negligible or negativeimpacts, although having the exact category example helps to increaseperformance by 15.38%. We also quantify the consistency of model performanceacross different classes within each task, finding that the coefficient ofvariance (CV) ranges from 26.02% to 58.03% across models, implying that subjectmatter expertise is needed - of 'difficult' classes - to achieve reliability inperformance.

Our framework allows us to better understand the dynamics,i.e., the behaviour of the model, when repeatedly exposing it to randomstrings. Using our framework, we make several striking observations: (a) wefind consistent phases of the dynamics across families of models (Pythia, Phiand Llama2), (b) we identify factors that make some strings easier to memorisethan others, and (c) we identify the role of local prefixes and global contextin memorisation.

However, previous methods fail to effectively leverage the rich knowledgein language models and often incorporate label semantics into visual featuresunidirectionally. To overcome these problems, we propose a Split-and-SynthesizePrompting with Gated Alignments (SSPA) framework to amplify the potential ofVLMs. Specifically, we develop an in-context learning approach to associate theinherent knowledge from LLMs. Then we propose a novel Split-and-SynthesizePrompting (SSP) strategy to first model the generic knowledge and downstreamlabel semantics individually and then aggregate them carefully through thequaternion network. Moreover, we present Gated Dual-Modal Alignments (GDMA) tobidirectionally interact visual and linguistic modalities while eliminatingredundant cross-modal information, enabling more efficient region-levelalignments. Rather than making the final prediction by a sharp manner inprevious works, we propose a soft aggregator to jointly consider results fromall image regions. With the help of flexible prompting and gated alignments,SSPA is generalizable to specific domains. Extensive experiments on ninedatasets from three domains (i.e., natural, pedestrian attributes and remotesensing) demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SSPA. Further analysesverify the effectiveness of SSP and the interpretability of GDMA. The code willbe made public.</description><author>Hao Tan, Zichang Tan, Jun Li, Jun Wan, Zhen Lei, Stan Z.

Mainstream LLMscan be grouped into two categories based on masking strategy: causal LLM andprefix LLM. Several works have demonstrated that prefix LLMs tend to outperformcausal ones in scenarios that heavily depend on historical context such asmulti-turn dialogues or in-context learning, thanks to their bidirectionalattention on prefix sequences. However, prefix LLMs have an inherentinefficient training problem in multi-turn dialogue datasets. In addition, theattention mechanism of prefix LLM makes it unable to reuse Key-Value Cache (KVCache) across dialogue rounds to reduce generation latency. In this paper, wepropose a novel masking scheme called Intermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM) toaddress these problems.

These gaps areprimarily due to the challenges posed by LLM hallucinations and the lack ofclear guidelines. In this paper, we propose Atlas, an advanced LLM-basedmulti-agent framework that integrates an efficient fuzzing workflow to targetgenerative AI models, specifically focusing on jailbreak attacks againsttext-to-image (T2I) models with safety filters. Atlas utilizes avision-language model (VLM) to assess whether a prompt triggers the T2I model'ssafety filter. It then iteratively collaborates with both LLM and VLM togenerate an alternative prompt that bypasses the filter. Atlas also enhancesthe reasoning abilities of LLMs in attack scenarios by leveraging multi-agentcommunication, in-context learning (ICL) memory mechanisms, and thechain-of-thought (COT) approach. Our evaluation demonstrates that Atlassuccessfully jailbreaks several state-of-the-art T2I models in a black-boxsetting, which are equipped with multi-modal safety filters.

A key challengeremains in adapting these models efficiently to new or unfamiliar tasks.In-context learning (ICL) provides a promising solution for few-shot adaptationby retrieving a set of data points relevant to a query, called in-contextexamples (ICE), from a training dataset and providing them during the inferenceas context. Most existing studies utilize a centralized training dataset, yetmany real-world datasets may be distributed among multiple clients, and remotedata retrieval can be associated with costs. Especially when the client dataare non-identical independent distributions (non-IID), retrieving from clientsa proper set of ICEs needed for a test query presents critical challenges. Inthis paper, we first show that in this challenging setting, test queries willhave different preferences among clients because of non-IIDness, and equalcontribution often leads to suboptimal performance. We then introduce a novelapproach to tackle the distributed non-IID ICL problem when a data usage budgetis present. The principle is that each client's proper contribution (budget)should be designed according to the preference of each query for that client.Our approach uses a data-driven manner to allocate a budget for each client,tailored to each test query.

Rethinking the Fundamental Reasoning Abilities of LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00114v1</link><description>Reasoning encompasses two typical types: deductive reasoning and inductivereasoning. Despite extensive research into the reasoning capabilities of LargeLanguage Models (LLMs), most studies have failed to rigorously differentiatebetween inductive and deductive reasoning, leading to a blending of the two.This raises an essential question: In LLM reasoning, which poses a greaterchallenge - deductive or inductive reasoning? While the deductive reasoningcapabilities of LLMs, (i.e. their capacity to follow instructions in reasoningtasks), have received considerable attention, their abilities in true inductivereasoning remain largely unexplored. To delve into the true inductive reasoningcapabilities of LLMs, we propose a novel framework, SolverLearner. Thisframework enables LLMs to learn the underlying function (i.e., $y = f_w(x)$),that maps input data points $(x)$ to their corresponding output values $(y)$,using only in-context examples. By focusing on inductive reasoning andseparating it from LLM-based deductive reasoning, we can isolate andinvestigate inductive reasoning of LLMs in its pure form via SolverLearner. Ourobservations reveal that LLMs demonstrate remarkable inductive reasoningcapabilities through SolverLearner, achieving near-perfect performance with ACCof 1 in most cases. Surprisingly, despite their strong inductive reasoningabilities, LLMs tend to relatively lack deductive reasoning capabilities,particularly in tasks involving ``counterfactual'' reasoning.</description><author>Kewei Cheng, Jingfeng Yang, Haoming Jiang, Zhengyang Wang, Binxuan Huang, Ruirui Li, Shiyang Li, Zheng Li, Yifan Gao, Xian Li, Bing Yin, Yizhou Sun</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 18:47:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00114v1</guid></item><item><title>Transformers Learn Temporal Difference Methods for In-Context Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13861v3</link><description>In-context learning refers to the learning ability of a model duringinference time without adapting its parameters. The input (i.e., prompt) to themodel (e.g., transformers) consists of both a context (i.e., instance-labelpairs) and a query instance. The model is then able to output a label for thequery instance according to the context during inference. A possibleexplanation for in-context learning is that the forward pass of (linear)transformers implements iterations of gradient descent on the instance-labelpairs in the context. In this paper, we prove by construction that transformerscan also implement temporal difference (TD) learning in the forward pass, aphenomenon we refer to as in-context TD. We demonstrate the emergence ofin-context TD after training the transformer with a multi-task TD algorithm,accompanied by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we prove that transformersare expressive enough to implement many other policy evaluation algorithms inthe forward pass, including residual gradient, TD with eligibility trace, andaverage-reward TD.</description><author>Jiuqi Wang, Ethan Blaser, Hadi Daneshmand, Shangtong Zhang</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 15:10:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13861v3</guid></item><item><title>NOLO: Navigate Only Look Once</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01384v1</link><description>The in-context learning ability of Transformer models has brought newpossibilities to visual navigation.

To mathematically and uniformlyaddress the expressivity of these architectures, we consider the case that themappings are conditioned on a context represented by a probability distributionof tokens (discrete for a finite number of tokens). The related notion ofsmoothness corresponds to continuity in terms of the Wasserstein distancebetween these contexts. We demonstrate that deep transformers are universal andcan approximate continuous in-context mappings to arbitrary precision,uniformly over compact token domains. A key aspect of our results, compared toexisting findings, is that for a fixed precision, a single transformer canoperate on an arbitrary (even infinite) number of tokens. Additionally, itoperates with a fixed embedding dimension of tokens (this dimension does notincrease with precision) and a fixed number of heads (proportional to thedimension).

Recent theoretical workinvestigates various mathematical models to analyze ICL, but existing modelsexplain only one operating mode at a time. We introduce a probabilistic model,with which one can explain the dual operating modes of ICL simultaneously.Focusing on in-context learning of linear functions, we extend existing modelsfor pretraining data by introducing multiple task groups and task-dependentinput distributions. We then analyze the behavior of the optimally pretrainedmodel under the squared loss, i.e., the MMSE estimator of the label givenin-context examples. Regarding pretraining task distribution as prior andin-context examples as the observation, we derive the closed-form expression ofthe task posterior distribution. With the closed-form expression, we obtain aquantitative understanding of the two operating modes of ICL. Furthermore, weshed light on an unexplained phenomenon observed in practice: under certainsettings, the ICL risk initially increases and then decreases with morein-context examples. Our model offers a plausible explanation for this "earlyascent" phenomenon: a limited number of in-context samples may lead to theretrieval of an incorrect skill, thereby increasing the risk, which willeventually diminish as task learning takes effect with more in-context samples.We also theoretically analyze ICL with biased labels, e.g., zero-shot ICL,where in-context examples are assigned random labels.

The Structured Task Hypothesis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04216v3</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit an intriguing ability to learn a noveltask from in-context examples presented in a demonstration, termed in-contextlearning (ICL). Understandably, a swath of research has been dedicated touncovering the theories underpinning ICL. One popular hypothesis explains ICLby task selection. LLMs identify the task based on the demonstration andgeneralize it to the prompt. Another popular hypothesis is that ICL is a formof meta-learning, i.e., the models learn a learning algorithm at pre-trainingtime and apply it to the demonstration. Finally, a third hypothesis argues thatLLMs use the demonstration to select a composition of tasks learned duringpre-training to perform ICL. In this paper, we empirically explore these threehypotheses that explain LLMs' ability to learn in context with a suite ofexperiments derived from common text classification tasks. We invalidate thefirst two hypotheses with counterexamples and provide evidence in support ofthe last hypothesis. Our results suggest an LLM could learn a novel task incontext via composing tasks learned during pre-training.</description><author>Jiaoda Li, Yifan Hou, Mrinmaya Sachan, Ryan Cotterell</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 15:08:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04216v3</guid></item><item><title>OneLove beyond the field -- A few-shot pipeline for topic and sentiment analysis during the FIFA World Cup in Qatar</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02520v1</link><description>The FIFA World Cup in Qatar was discussed extensively in the news and onsocial media. Due to news reports with allegations of human rights violations,there were calls to boycott it. Wearing a OneLove armband was part of a plannedprotest activity. Controversy around the armband arose when FIFA threatened tosanction captains who wear it. To understand what topics Twitter users Tweetedabout and what the opinion of German Twitter users was towards the OneLovearmband, we performed an analysis of German Tweets published during the WorldCup using in-context learning with LLMs. We validated the labels on humanannotations. We found that Twitter users initially discussed the armband'simpact, LGBT rights, and politics; after the ban, the conversation shiftedtowards politics in sports in general, accompanied by a subtle shift insentiment towards neutrality. Our evaluation serves as a framework for futureresearch to explore the impact of sports activism and evolving publicsentiment. This is especially useful in settings where labeling datasets forspecific opinions is unfeasible, such as when events are unfolding.</description><author>Christoph Rauchegger, Sonja Mei Wang, Pieter Delobelle</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 14:40:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02520v1</guid></item><item><title>Affect Recognition in Conversations Using Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12881v2</link><description>Affect recognition, encompassing emotions, moods, and feelings, plays apivotal role in human communication.

This studyinvestigates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to recognise humanaffect in conversations, with a focus on both open-domain chit-chat dialoguesand task-oriented dialogues. Leveraging three diverse datasets, namely IEMOCAP(Busso et al., 2008), EmoWOZ (Feng et al., 2022), and DAIC-WOZ (Gratch et al.,2014), covering a spectrum of dialogues from casual conversations to clinicalinterviews, we evaluate and compare LLMs' performance in affect recognition.Our investigation explores the zero-shot and few-shot capabilities of LLMsthrough in-context learning as well as their model capacities throughtask-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, this study takes into account thepotential impact of automatic speech recognition errors on LLM predictions.With this work, we aim to shed light on the extent to which LLMs can replicatehuman-like affect recognition capabilities in conversations.</description><author>Shutong Feng, Guangzhi Sun, Nurul Lubis, Wen Wu, Chao Zhang, Milica Gašić</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 12:13:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12881v2</guid></item><item><title>A Few-Shot Approach for Relation Extraction Domain Adaptation using Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02377v1</link><description>Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been successfully applied to the analysis ofcomplex scientific and technological domains, with automatic KG generationmethods typically building upon relation extraction models capturingfine-grained relations between domain entities in text.

Providing amechanistic interpretation and linking the empirical phenomenon to physics arethus challenging and remain unsolved. We study a simple yet expressivetransformer with linear attention, and map this structure to a spin glass modelwith real-valued spins, where the couplings and fields explain the intrinsicdisorder in data. The spin glass model explains how the weight parametersinteract with each other during pre-training, and most importantly why anunseen function can be predicted by providing only a prompt yet withouttraining. Our theory reveals that for single instance learning, increasing thetask diversity leads to the emergence of the in-context learning, by allowingthe Boltzmann distribution to converge to a unique correct solution of weightparameters. Therefore the pre-trained transformer displays a prediction powerin a novel prompt setting.

Most techniques for improving OOD robustness are not applicable tosettings where the model is effectively a black box, such as when the weightsare frozen, retraining is costly, or the model is leveraged via an API.Test-time augmentation (TTA) is a simple post-hoc technique for improvingrobustness that sidesteps black-box constraints by aggregating predictionsacross multiple augmentations of the test input. TTA has seen limited use inNLP due to the challenge of generating effective natural languageaugmentations. In this work, we propose LLM-TTA, which uses LLM-generatedaugmentations as TTA's augmentation function. LLM-TTA outperforms conventionalaugmentation functions across sentiment, toxicity, and news classificationtasks for BERT and T5 models, with BERT's OOD robustness improving by anaverage of 4.48 percentage points without regressing average ID performance. Weexplore selectively augmenting inputs based on prediction entropy to reduce therate of expensive LLM augmentations, allowing us to maintain performance gainswhile reducing the average number of generated augmentations by 57.74\%.LLM-TTA is agnostic to the task model architecture, does not require OODlabels, and is effective across low and high-resource settings.

To refinethis approach, we focus primarily on an innovative selective annotationmechanism, which precedes the standard demonstration retrieval. We introducethe Language Model-based Determinant Point Process (LM-DPP) that simultaneouslyconsiders the uncertainty and diversity of unlabeled instances for optimalselection. Consequently, this yields a subset for annotation that strikes atrade-off between the two factors. We apply LM-DPP to various language models,including GPT-J, LlaMA, and GPT-3. Experimental results on 9 NLU and 2Generation datasets demonstrate that LM-DPP can effectively select canonicalexamples.

Several techniques have beenproposed in the literature for different dialogue types (e.g., Open-Domain).However, the evaluations of these techniques have been limited in terms of baseLLMs, dialogue types and evaluation metrics. In this work, we extensivelyanalyze different LLM adaptation techniques when applied to different dialoguetypes. We have selected two base LLMs, Llama-2 and Mistral, and four dialoguetypes Open-Domain, Knowledge-Grounded, Task-Oriented, and Question Answering.We evaluate the performance of in-context learning and fine-tuning techniquesacross datasets selected for each dialogue type. We assess the impact ofincorporating external knowledge to ground the generation in both scenarios ofRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and gold knowledge. We adopt consistentevaluation and explainability criteria for automatic metrics and humanevaluation protocols. Our analysis shows that there is no universalbest-technique for adapting large language models as the efficacy of eachtechnique depends on both the base LLM and the specific type of dialogue. Lastbut not least, the assessment of the best adaptation technique should includehuman evaluation to avoid false expectations and outcomes derived fromautomatic metrics.</description><author>Simone Alghisi, Massimo Rizzoli, Gabriel Roccabruna, Seyed Mahed Mousavi, Giuseppe Riccardi</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Aug 2024 15:12:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06399v3</guid></item><item><title>OpenLogParser: Unsupervised Parsing with Open-Source Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01585v1</link><description>Log parsing is a critical step that transforms unstructured log data intostructured formats, facilitating subsequent log-based analysis. Traditionalsyntax-based log parsers are efficient and effective, but they often experiencedecreased accuracy when processing logs that deviate from the predefined rules.Recently, large language models (LLM) based log parsers have shown superiorparsing accuracy. However, existing LLM-based parsers face three mainchallenges: 1)time-consuming and labor-intensive manual labeling forfine-tuning or in-context learning, 2)increased parsing costs due to the vastvolume of log data and limited context size of LLMs, and 3)privacy risks fromusing commercial models like ChatGPT with sensitive log information. Toovercome these limitations, this paper introduces OpenLogParser, anunsupervised log parsing approach that leverages open-source LLMs (i.e.,Llama3-8B) to enhance privacy and reduce operational costs while achievingstate-of-the-art parsing accuracy. OpenLogParser first groups logs with similarstatic text but varying dynamic variables using a fixed-depth grouping tree. Itthen parses logs within these groups using three components: i)similarityscoring-based retrieval augmented generation: selects diverse logs within eachgroup based on Jaccard similarity, helping the LLM distinguish between statictext and dynamic variables; ii)self-reflection: iteratively query LLMs torefine log templates to improve parsing accuracy; and iii) log template memory:stores parsed templates to reduce LLM queries for improved parsing efficiency.Our evaluation on LogHub-2.0 shows that OpenLogParser achieves 25% higherparsing accuracy and processes logs 2.7 times faster compared tostate-of-the-art LLM-based parsers. In short, OpenLogParser addresses privacyand cost concerns of using commercial LLMs while achieving state-of-the-artsparsing efficiency and accuracy.</description><author>Zeyang Ma, Dong Jae Kim, Tse-Hsun Chen</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 21:54:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01585v1</guid></item><item><title>Dynamic In-context Learning with Conversational Models for Data Extraction and Materials Property Prediction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10448v2</link><description>The advent of natural language processing and large language models (LLMs)has revolutionized the extraction of data from unstructured scholarly papers.However, ensuring data trustworthiness remains a significant challenge.

We characterize which latent conceptspre-trained sequence models are naturally able to reason with. We go back to DeFinetti's predictive view of Bayesian reasoning: instead of modeling latentparameters through priors and likelihoods like topic models do, De Finetti haslong advocated for modeling exchangeable (permutation invariant) sequences ofobservables. According to this view, pre-training autoregressive modelsformulates informed beliefs based on prior observations ("empirical Bayes"),and forward generation is a simulated instantiation of an environment("posterior inference"). This connection allows extending in-context learning(ICL) beyond predictive settings, highlighting sequence models' ability toperform explicit statistical inference. In particular, we show the sequenceprediction loss over exchangeable documents controls performance on downstreamtasks where uncertainty quantification is key. Empirically, we propose anddemonstrate several approaches for encoding exchangeability in sequence modelarchitectures: data augmentation, regularization, and causal masking.</description><author>Naimeng Ye, Hanming Yang, Andrew Siah, Hongseok Namkoong</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 17:16:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03307v1</guid></item><item><title>Enhancing Complex Causality Extraction via Improved Subtask Interaction and Knowledge Fusion</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03079v1</link><description>Event Causality Extraction (ECE) aims at extracting causal event pairs fromtexts.

However, existing fine-tuning based ECE methodscannot address all three key challenges in ECE simultaneously: 1) ComplexCausality Extraction, where multiple causal-effect pairs occur within a singlesentence; 2) Subtask~ Interaction, which involves modeling the mutualdependence between the two subtasks of ECE, i.e., extracting events andidentifying the causal relationship between extracted events; and 3) KnowledgeFusion, which requires effectively fusing the knowledge in two modalities,i.e., the expressive pretrained language models and the structured knowledgegraphs. In this paper, we propose a unified ECE framework (UniCE to address allthree issues in ECE simultaneously. Specifically, we design a subtaskinteraction mechanism to enable mutual interaction between the two ECEsubtasks. Besides, we design a knowledge fusion mechanism to fuse knowledge inthe two modalities. Furthermore, we employ separate decoders for each subtaskto facilitate complex causality extraction.

Despite extensive research into the reasoning capabilities of LargeLanguage Models (LLMs), most studies have failed to rigorously differentiatebetween inductive and deductive reasoning, leading to a blending of the two.This raises an essential question: In LLM reasoning, which poses a greaterchallenge - deductive or inductive reasoning? While the deductive reasoningcapabilities of LLMs, (i.e. their capacity to follow instructions in reasoningtasks), have received considerable attention, their abilities in true inductivereasoning remain largely unexplored. To investigate into the true inductivereasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose a novel framework, SolverLearner.This framework enables LLMs to learn the underlying function (i.e., $y =f_w(x)$), that maps input data points $(x)$ to their corresponding outputvalues $(y)$, using only in-context examples. By focusing on inductivereasoning and separating it from LLM-based deductive reasoning, we can isolateand investigate inductive reasoning of LLMs in its pure form via SolverLearner.Our observations reveal that LLMs demonstrate remarkable inductive reasoningcapabilities through SolverLearner, achieving near-perfect performance with ACCof 1 in most cases. Surprisingly, despite their strong inductive reasoningabilities, LLMs tend to relatively lack deductive reasoning capabilities,particularly in tasks involving ``counterfactual'' reasoning.</description><author>Kewei Cheng, Jingfeng Yang, Haoming Jiang, Zhengyang Wang, Binxuan Huang, Ruirui Li, Shiyang Li, Zheng Li, Yifan Gao, Xian Li, Bing Yin, Yizhou Sun</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 00:52:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00114v2</guid></item><item><title>Can LLMs Serve As Time Series Anomaly Detectors?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03475v1</link><description>An emerging topic in large language models (LLMs) is their application totime series forecasting, characterizing mainstream and patternablecharacteristics of time series.

Recentstudies have suggested that transformers can implement gradient descent as anin-context learner for linear regression problems and have developed varioustheoretical analyses accordingly. However, these works mostly focus on theexpressive power of transformers by designing specific parameter constructions,lacking a comprehensive understanding of their inherent working mechanismspost-training. In this study, we consider a sparse linear regression problemand investigate how a trained multi-head transformer performs in-contextlearning. We experimentally discover that the utilization of multi-headsexhibits different patterns across layers: multiple heads are utilized andessential in the first layer, while usually only a single head is sufficientfor subsequent layers. We provide a theoretical explanation for thisobservation: the first layer preprocesses the context data, and the followinglayers execute simple optimization steps based on the preprocessed context.Moreover, we demonstrate that such a preprocess-then-optimize algorithm cansignificantly outperform naive gradient descent and ridge regressionalgorithms. Further experimental results support our explanations.

The prowess of LLMs is underpinned by their substantial model size,extensive and diverse datasets, and the vast computational power harnessedduring training, all of which contribute to the emergent abilities of LLMs(e.g., in-context learning) that are not present in small models. Within thiscontext, the mixture of experts (MoE) has emerged as an effective method forsubstantially scaling up model capacity with minimal computation overhead,gaining significant attention from academia and industry. Despite its growingprevalence, there lacks a systematic and comprehensive review of the literatureon MoE. This survey seeks to bridge that gap, serving as an essential resourcefor researchers delving into the intricacies of MoE. We first briefly introducethe structure of the MoE layer, followed by proposing a new taxonomy of MoE.Next, we overview the core designs for various MoE models including bothalgorithmic and systemic aspects, alongside collections of availableopen-source implementations, hyperparameter configurations and empiricalevaluations. Furthermore, we delineate the multifaceted applications of MoE inpractice, and outline some potential directions for future research.

Moreover, iftheir capabilities can be enhanced with information retrieval to accessup-to-date knowledge, the current integration of LLMs with Informationretrieval lacks robustness to imperfect retrieval, which can hinder theireffectiveness and even reduce overall performance. In this work, we addressthis challenge by introducing the Retrieval-Augmented Thought Process (RATP).Given access to external knowledge, RATP formulates the thought generation ofLLMs as a multiple-step decision process. To optimise such a thought process,RATP leverages Monte-Carlo Tree Search and learns a proxy reward function thatpermits cost-efficient inference. On a private dataset of electronic medicalrecords, deliberately excluded from any LLM training set, RATP achieves 35%additional accuracy compared to in-context retrieval-augmented generation forthe question-answering task.</description><author>Thomas Pouplin, Hao Sun, Samuel Holt, Mihaela van der Schaar</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 18:27:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07812v2</guid></item><item><title>SCOI: Syntax-augmented Coverage-based In-context Example Selection for Machine Translation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04872v1</link><description>In-context learning (ICL) greatly improves the performance of large languagemodels (LLMs) on various down-stream tasks, where the improvement highlydepends on the quality of demonstrations.

An Investigation into Limitations and Scalability</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15720v2</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for many AIproblems and exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities.Compositional ability, solving unseen complex tasks that combine two or moresimple tasks, is an essential reasoning ability for Artificial GeneralIntelligence. Despite the tremendous success of LLMs, how they approachcomposite tasks, especially those not encountered during the pretraining phase,remains an open and largely underexplored question. In this study, we delveinto the ICL capabilities of LLMs on composite tasks, with only simple tasks asin-context examples. We develop a test suite of composite tasks includinglinguistic and logical challenges and perform empirical studies acrossdifferent LLM families. We observe that models exhibit divergent behaviors: (1)For simpler composite tasks that apply distinct mapping mechanisms to differentinput segments, the models demonstrate decent compositional ability, whilescaling up the model enhances this ability; (2) for more complex compositetasks involving reasoning multiple steps, where each step represents one task,models typically underperform, and scaling up generally provides noimprovements. We offer theoretical analysis in a simplified setting, explainingthat models exhibit compositional capability when the task handles differentinput parts separately. We believe our work sheds new light on the capabilitiesof LLMs in solving composite tasks regarding the nature of the tasks and modelscale.

Self-attention allowstransformers to encode causal structure which makes them particularly suitablefor sequence modeling. However, the process by which transformers learn suchcausal structure via gradient-based training algorithms remains poorlyunderstood. To better understand this process, we introduce an in-contextlearning task that requires learning latent causal structure. We prove thatgradient descent on a simplified two-layer transformer learns to solve thistask by encoding the latent causal graph in the first attention layer. The keyinsight of our proof is that the gradient of the attention matrix encodes themutual information between tokens. As a consequence of the data processinginequality, the largest entries of this gradient correspond to edges in thelatent causal graph. As a special case, when the sequences are generated fromin-context Markov chains, we prove that transformers learn an induction head(Olsson et al., 2022). We confirm our theoretical findings by showing thattransformers trained on our in-context learning task are able to recover a widevariety of causal structures.</description><author>Eshaan Nichani, Alex Damian, Jason D.

However, variations indemonstrations can lead to significantly different performances. Currentresearch mainly focuses on selecting demonstration samples, preassuming theclass name to be the label word when creating sample-label pairs. However, thechoice of label words is crucial for ICL performance. Besides, we observe thatusing a single class name in demonstration may not yield optimal results whileusing multiple label words in one sample-label pair can enhance ICLperformance. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive approach that organizesboth samples and labels in demonstrations based on LLMs' output spacedistribution.

We present Prior-Data Fitted Networks(PFNs). PFNs leverage in-context learning in large-scale machine learningtechniques to approximate a large set of posteriors. The only requirement forPFNs to work is the ability to sample from a prior distribution over supervisedlearning tasks (or functions). Our method restates the objective of posteriorapproximation as a supervised classification problem with a set-valued input:it repeatedly draws a task (or function) from the prior, draws a set of datapoints and their labels from it, masks one of the labels and learns to makeprobabilistic predictions for it based on the set-valued input of the rest ofthe data points. Presented with a set of samples from a new supervised learningtask as input, PFNs make probabilistic predictions for arbitrary other datapoints in a single forward propagation, having learned to approximate Bayesianinference. We demonstrate that PFNs can near-perfectly mimic Gaussian processesand also enable efficient Bayesian inference for intractable problems, withover 200-fold speedups in multiple setups compared to current methods. Weobtain strong results in very diverse areas such as Gaussian processregression, Bayesian neural networks, classification for small tabular datasets, and few-shot image classification, demonstrating the generality of PFNs.Code and trained PFNs are released athttps://github.com/automl/TransformersCanDoBayesianInference.</description><author>Samuel Müller, Noah Hollmann, Sebastian Pineda Arango, Josif Grabocka, Frank Hutter</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 09:58:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10510v7</guid></item><item><title>Evaluating the Adversarial Robustness of Retrieval-Based In-Context Learning for Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15984v2</link><description>With the emergence of large language models, such as LLaMA and OpenAI GPT-3,In-Context Learning (ICL) gained significant attention due to its effectivenessand efficiency. However, ICL is very sensitive to the choice, order, andverbaliser used to encode the demonstrations in the prompt. Retrieval-AugmentedICL methods try to address this problem by leveraging retrievers to extractsemantically related examples as demonstrations. While this approach yieldsmore accurate results, its robustness against various types of adversarialattacks, including perturbations on test samples, demonstrations, and retrieveddata, remains under-explored. Our study reveals that retrieval-augmented modelscan enhance robustness against test sample attacks, outperforming vanilla ICLwith a 4.87% reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR); however, they exhibitoverconfidence in the demonstrations, leading to a 2% increase in ASR fordemonstration attacks. Adversarial training can help improve the robustness ofICL methods to adversarial attacks; however, such a training scheme can be toocostly in the context of LLMs. As an alternative, we introduce an effectivetraining-free adversarial defence method, DARD, which enriches the example poolwith those attacked samples. We show that DARD yields improvements inperformance and robustness, achieving a 15% reduction in ASR over thebaselines.
