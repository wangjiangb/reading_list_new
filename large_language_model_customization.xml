Recently,Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) have shown superior text modelingand generating ability, which could be applied in review generation. However,directly applying the LLMs for generating reviews might be troubled by the``polite'' phenomenon of the LLMs and could not generate personalized reviews(e.g., negative reviews). In this paper, we propose Review-LLM that customizesLLMs for personalized review generation. Firstly, we construct the prompt inputby aggregating user historical behaviors, which include corresponding itemtitles and reviews. This enables the LLMs to capture user interest features andreview writing style. Secondly, we incorporate ratings as indicators ofsatisfaction into the prompt, which could further improve the model'sunderstanding of user preferences and the sentiment tendency control ofgenerated reviews. Finally, we feed the prompt text into LLMs, and useSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to make the model generate personalized reviewsfor the given user and target item. Experimental results on the real-worlddataset show that our fine-tuned model could achieve better review generationperformance than existing close-source LLMs.</description><author>Qiyao Peng, Hongtao Liu, Hongyan Xu, Qing Yang, Minglai Shao, Wenjun Wang</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 09:22:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07487v1</guid></item><item><title>PANGeA: Procedural Artificial Narrative using Generative AI for Turn-Based Video Games</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19721v3</link><description>This research introduces Procedural Artificial Narrative using Generative AI(PANGeA), a structured approach for leveraging large language models (LLMs),guided by a game designer's high-level criteria, to generate narrative contentfor turn-based role-playing video games (RPGs). Distinct from priorapplications of LLMs used for video game design, PANGeA innovates by not onlygenerating game level data (which includes, but is not limited to, setting, keyitems, and non-playable characters (NPCs)), but by also fostering dynamic,free-form interactions between the player and the environment that align withthe procedural game narrative. The NPCs generated by PANGeA arepersonality-biased and express traits from the Big 5 Personality Model in theirgenerated responses. PANGeA addresses challenges behind ingesting free-formtext input, which can prompt LLM responses beyond the scope of the gamenarrative. A novel validation system that uses the LLM's intelligence evaluatestext input and aligns generated responses with the unfolding narrative. Makingthese interactions possible, PANGeA is supported by a server that hosts acustom memory system that supplies context for augmenting generated responsesthus aligning them with the procedural narrative. For its broad application,the server has a REST interface enabling any game engine to integrate directlywith PANGeA, as well as an LLM interface adaptable with local or private LLMs.PANGeA's ability to foster dynamic narrative generation by aligning responseswith the procedural narrative is demonstrated through an empirical study andablation test of two versions of a demo game. These are, a custom,browser-based GPT and a Unity demo. As the results show, PANGeA holds potentialto assist game designers in using LLMs to generate narrative-consistent contenteven when provided varied and unpredictable, free-form text input.</description><author>Steph Buongiorno, Lawrence Jake Klinkert, Tanishq Chawla, Zixin Zhuang, Corey Clark</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 23:45:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19721v3</guid></item><item><title>FlowLearn: Evaluating Large Vision-Language Models on Flowchart Understanding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05183v2</link><description>Flowcharts are graphical tools for representing complex concepts in concisevisual representations. This paper introduces the FlowLearn dataset, a resourcetailored to enhance the understanding of flowcharts. FlowLearn contains complexscientific flowcharts and simulated flowcharts. The scientific subset contains3,858 flowcharts sourced from scientific literature and the simulated subsetcontains 10,000 flowcharts created using a customizable script. The dataset isenriched with annotations for visual components, OCR, Mermaid coderepresentation, and VQA question-answer pairs. Despite the proven capabilitiesof Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in various visual understanding tasks,their effectiveness in decoding flowcharts - a crucial element of scientificcommunication - has yet to be thoroughly investigated. The FlowLearn test setis crafted to assess the performance of LVLMs in flowchart comprehension. Ourstudy thoroughly evaluates state-of-the-art LVLMs, identifying existinglimitations and establishing a foundation for future enhancements in thisrelatively underexplored domain.

A promising approach towards this means is tobuild dialog tutoring models that scaffold students' problem-solving. However,even though existing LLMs perform well in solving reasoning questions, theystruggle to precisely detect student's errors and tailor their feedback tothese errors. Inspired by real-world teaching practice where teachers identifystudent errors and customize their response based on them, we focus onverifying student solutions and show how grounding to such verificationimproves the overall quality of tutor response generation. We collect a datasetof 1K stepwise math reasoning chains with the first error step annotated byteachers. We show empirically that finding the mistake in a student solution ischallenging for current models. We propose and evaluate several verifiers fordetecting these errors. Using both automatic and human evaluation we show thatthe student solution verifiers steer the generation model towards highlytargeted responses to student errors which are more often correct with lesshallucinations compared to existing baselines.</description><author>Nico Daheim, Jakub Macina, Manu Kapur, Iryna Gurevych, Mrinmaya Sachan</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 10:11:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09136v1</guid></item><item><title>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14608v6</link><description>Large models represent a groundbreaking advancement in multiple applicationfields, enabling remarkable achievements across various tasks. However, theirunprecedented scale comes with significant computational costs. These models,often consisting of billions of parameters, require vast amounts ofcomputational resources for execution. Especially, the expansive scale andcomputational demands pose considerable challenges when customizing them forparticular downstream tasks, particularly over the hardware platformsconstrained by computational capabilities. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) provides a practical solution by efficiently adjusting the large modelsover the various downstream tasks. In particular, PEFT refers to the process ofadjusting the parameters of a pre-trained large models to adapt it to aspecific task or domain while minimizing the number of additional parametersintroduced or computational resources required. This approach is particularlyimportant when dealing with large-scale language models with high parametercounts, as fine-tuning these models from scratch can be computationallyexpensive and resource-intensive, posing considerable challenges in thesupporting system platform design. In this survey, we present comprehensivestudies of various PEFT algorithms, examining their performance andcomputational overhead. Moreover, we provide an overview of applicationsdeveloped using different PEFT algorithms and discuss common techniquesemployed to mitigate computation costs for PEFT. In addition to providing anextensive survey from an algorithmic standpoint, we also examine variousreal-world system designs to investigate the implementation costs associatedwith different PEFT approaches.

Thesecustomizations are often iteratively re-engineered to improve some aspect ofperformance, but after each change businesses want to ensure that there hasbeen no negative impact on the system's behavior around such critical issues asbias. Prior methods of benchmarking bias use techniques such as word maskingand multiple choice questions to assess bias at scale, but these do not captureall of the nuanced types of bias that can occur in free response answers, thetypes of answers typically generated by LLM systems. In this paper, we identifyseveral kinds of nuanced bias in free text that cannot be similarly identifiedby multiple choice tests. We describe these as: confidence bias, implied bias,inclusion bias and erasure bias. We present a semi-automated pipeline fordetecting these types of bias by first eliminating answers that can beautomatically classified as unbiased and then co-evaluating name reversed pairsusing crowd workers. We believe that the nuanced classifications our methodgenerates can be used to give better feedback to LLMs, especially as LLMreasoning capabilities become more advanced.</description><author>Jennifer Healey, Laurie Byrum, Md Nadeem Akhtar, Moumita Sinha</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 19:58:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08842v1</guid></item><item><title>UrbanWorld: An Urban World Model for 3D City Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11965v1</link><description>Cities, as the most fundamental environment of human life, encompass diversephysical elements such as buildings, roads and vegetation with complexinterconnection. Crafting realistic, interactive 3D urban environments plays acrucial role in constructing AI agents capable of perceiving, decision-making,and acting like humans in real-world environments. However, creatinghigh-fidelity 3D urban environments usually entails extensive manual labor fromdesigners, involving intricate detailing and accurate representation of complexurban features.

These studies generally utilize visualinstruction tuning with specialized datasets to enhance question and answer(QA) accuracy within the chart domain. However, they often neglect thefundamental discrepancy between natural image-caption pre-training data anddigital chart image-QA data, particularly in the models' capacity to extractunderlying numeric values from charts. This paper tackles this oversight byexploring the training processes necessary to improve MLLMs' comprehension ofcharts.

Theseapplications have significantly expanded the attack surface of LLMs, exposingthem to a variety of threats. Among them, jailbreak attacks that induce toxicresponses through jailbreak prompts have raised critical safety concerns. Toidentify these threats, a growing number of red teaming approaches simulatepotential adversarial scenarios by crafting jailbreak prompts to test thetarget LLM. However, existing red teaming methods do not consider the uniquevulnerabilities of LLM in different scenarios, making it difficult to adjustthe jailbreak prompts to find context-specific vulnerabilities. Meanwhile,these methods are limited to refining jailbreak templates using a few mutationoperations, lacking the automation and scalability to adapt to differentscenarios. To enable context-aware and efficient red teaming, we abstract andmodel existing attacks into a coherent concept called "jailbreak strategy" andpropose a multi-agent LLM system named RedAgent that leverages these strategiesto generate context-aware jailbreak prompts. By self-reflecting on contextualfeedback in an additional memory buffer, RedAgent continuously learns how toleverage these strategies to achieve effective jailbreaks in specific contexts.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can jailbreak most black-boxLLMs in just five queries, improving the efficiency of existing red teamingmethods by two times. Additionally, RedAgent can jailbreak customized LLMapplications more efficiently.

We introducea novel, model-agnostic framework for learning custom input tags, which areparameterized as continuous vectors appended to the LLM's embedding layer, tocondition the LLM. We design two types of input tags: domain tags are used todelimit specialized representations (e.g., chemical formulas) and providedomain-relevant context; function tags are used to represent specific functions(e.g., predicting molecular properties) and compress function-solvinginstructions. We develop a three-stage protocol to learn these tags usingauxiliary data and domain knowledge. By explicitly disentangling task domainsfrom task functions, our method enables zero-shot generalization to unseenproblems through diverse combinations of the input tags. It also boosts LLM'sperformance in various specialized domains, such as predicting protein orchemical properties and modeling drug-target interactions, outperforming expertmodels tailored to these tasks.</description><author>Junhong Shen, Neil Tenenholtz, James Brian Hall, David Alvarez-Melis, Nicolo Fusi</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 01:28:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05140v3</guid></item><item><title>AnyHome: Open-Vocabulary Generation of Structured and Textured 3D Homes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06644v3</link><description>Inspired by cognitive theories, we introduce AnyHome, a framework thattranslates any text into well-structured and textured indoor scenes at ahouse-scale.

These studies generally utilize visualinstruction tuning with specialized datasets to enhance question and answer(QA) accuracy within the chart domain. However, they often neglect thefundamental discrepancy between natural image-caption pre-training data anddigital chart image-QA data, particularly in the models' capacity to extractunderlying numeric values from charts. This paper tackles this oversight byexploring the training processes necessary to improve MLLMs' comprehension ofcharts. We present three key findings: (1) Incorporating raw data values inalignment pre-training markedly improves comprehension of chart data. (2)Replacing images with their textual representation randomly during end-to-endfine-tuning transfer the language reasoning capability to chart interpretationskills. (3) Requiring the model to first extract the underlying chart data andthen answer the question in the fine-tuning can further improve the accuracy.Consequently, we introduce CHOPINLLM, an MLLM tailored for in-depth chartcomprehension. CHOPINLLM effectively interprets various types of charts,including unannotated ones, while maintaining robust reasoning abilities.Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' understanding ofdifferent chart types across various comprehension levels.

Today,LLM inference clusters receive a large number of queries with strict ServiceLevel Objectives (SLOs). To achieve the desired performance, these modelsexecute on power-hungry GPUs causing the inference clusters to consume largeamount of energy and, consequently, result in excessive carbon emissions.Fortunately, we find that there is a great opportunity to exploit theheterogeneity in inference compute properties and fluctuations in inferenceworkloads, to significantly improve energy-efficiency.

While high-performance computing (HPC) systems equipped withstate-of-the-art GPUs are well-suited for training LLMs, their batch schedulingparadigm is not designed to support real-time serving of AI applications. Cloudsystems, on the other hand, are well suited for web services but commonly lackaccess to the computational power of HPC clusters, especially expensive andscarce high-end GPUs, which are required for optimal inference speed. Wepropose an architecture with an implementation consisting of a web service thatruns on a cloud VM with secure access to a scalable backend running a multitudeof LLM models on HPC systems.

This vastly increases the applicability of peerprediction mechanisms as textual feedback is the norm in a large variety offeedback channels: peer reviews, e-commerce customer reviews, and comments onsocial media.

These mechanismsutilize LLMs as predictors, mapping from one agent's report to a prediction ofher peer's report. Theoretically, we show that when the LLM prediction issufficiently accurate, our mechanisms can incentivize high effort andtruth-telling as an (approximate) Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Empirically, weconfirm the efficacy of our mechanisms through experiments conducted on tworeal datasets: the Yelp review dataset and the ICLR OpenReview dataset.

Unraveling Prompt Extraction Threats in Customized Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02416v1</link><description>The drastic increase of large language models' (LLMs) parameters has led to anew research direction of fine-tuning-free downstream customization by prompts,i.e., task descriptions. While these prompt-based services (e.g. OpenAI's GPTs)play an important role in many businesses, there has emerged growing concernsabout the prompt leakage, which undermines the intellectual properties of theseservices and causes downstream attacks. In this paper, we analyze theunderlying mechanism of prompt leakage, which we refer to as promptmemorization, and develop corresponding defending strategies. By exploring thescaling laws in prompt extraction, we analyze key attributes that influenceprompt extraction, including model sizes, prompt lengths, as well as the typesof prompts. Then we propose two hypotheses that explain how LLMs expose theirprompts. The first is attributed to the perplexity, i.e. the familiarity ofLLMs to texts, whereas the second is based on the straightforward tokentranslation path in attention matrices. To defend against such threats, weinvestigate whether alignments can undermine the extraction of prompts. We findthat current LLMs, even those with safety alignments like GPT-4, are highlyvulnerable to prompt extraction attacks, even under the most straightforwarduser attacks. Therefore, we put forward several defense strategies with theinspiration of our findings, which achieve 83.8\% and 71.0\% drop in the promptextraction rate for Llama2-7B and GPT-3.5, respectively.

Developing an e-commerce shopping assistant for customers iscrucial to aiding them in quickly finding desired products and recommendingprecisely what they need. However, most previous shopping assistants face twomain problems: (1) task-specificity, which necessitates the development ofdifferent models for various tasks, thereby increasing development costs andlimiting effectiveness; and (2) poor generalization, where the trained modelperforms inadequately on up-to-date products. To resolve these issues, weemploy Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct an omnipotent assistant,leveraging their adeptness at handling multiple tasks and their superiorgeneralization capability. Nonetheless, LLMs lack inherent knowledge ofe-commerce concepts. To address this, we create an instruction datasetcomprising 65,000 samples and diverse tasks, termed as EshopInstruct.

Although recent works have achieved promising performance, the lack ofversatility and customization hinders their practical applications in broaderscenarios. Therefore, this work presents a novel image outpainting frameworkthat is capable of customizing the results according to the requirement ofusers. First of all, we take advantage of a Multimodal Large Language Model(MLLM) that automatically extracts and organizes the corresponding textualdescriptions of the masked and unmasked part of a given image. Accordingly, theobtained text prompts are introduced to endow our model with the capacity tocustomize the outpainting results. In addition, a special Cross-Attentionmodule, namely Center-Total-Surrounding (CTS), is elaborately designed toenhance further the the interaction between specific space regions of the imageand corresponding parts of the text prompts. Note that unlike most existingmethods, our approach is very resource-efficient since it is just slightlyfine-tuned on the off-the-shelf stable diffusion (SD) model rather than beingtrained from scratch.

Inthis study, we explore the representation and processing of Argument StructureConstructions (ASCs) in a recurrent neural language model. We trained a LongShort-Term Memory (LSTM) network on a custom-made dataset consisting of 2000sentences, generated using GPT-4, representing four distinct ASCs: transitive,ditransitive, caused-motion, and resultative constructions. We analyzed the internal activations of the LSTM model's hidden layers usingMultidimensional Scaling (MDS) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding(t-SNE) to visualize the sentence representations. The GeneralizedDiscrimination Value (GDV) was calculated to quantify the degree of clusteringwithin these representations. Our results show that sentence representationsform distinct clusters corresponding to the four ASCs across all hidden layers,with the most pronounced clustering observed in the last hidden layer beforethe output layer. This indicates that even a relatively simple,brain-constrained recurrent neural network can effectively differentiatebetween various construction types. These findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating theemergence of word class and syntax rule representations in recurrent languagemodels trained on next word prediction tasks. In future work, we aim tovalidate these results using larger language models and compare them withneuroimaging data obtained during continuous speech perception.

Current mainstream efforts mainlycenter around injecting personalized information from recommendation modelsinto LLMs by customizing input templates or aligning representations betweensemantic and recommendation spaces at the prediction layer. However, they facethree significant limitations: (1) LoRA is mostly used as a core component inexisting works, but personalization is not well established in LoRA parametersas the LoRA matrix shared by every user may not cater to different users'characteristics, leading to suboptimal performance. (2) Although lifelongpersonalized behavior sequences are ideal for personalization, their use raiseseffectiveness and efficiency issues since LLMs require escalating training andinference time to extend text lengths. (3) Existing approaches aren't scalablefor large datasets due to training efficiency constraints. Thus, LLMs only seea small fraction of the datasets (e.g., less than 10%) instead of the wholedatasets, limiting their exposure to the full training space. To address theseproblems, we propose RecLoRA. This model incorporates a Personalized LoRAmodule that maintains independent LoRAs for different users and a Long-ShortModality Retriever that retrieves different history lengths for differentmodalities, significantly improving performance while adding minimal time cost.Furthermore, we design a Few2Many Learning Strategy, using a conventionalrecommendation model as a lens to magnify small training spaces to full spaces.Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the efficacy of ourRecLoRA compared to existing baseline models.</description><author>Jiachen Zhu, Jianghao Lin, Xinyi Dai, Bo Chen, Rong Shan, Jieming Zhu, Ruiming Tang, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 04:20:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03533v1</guid></item><item><title>RULER: What's the Real Context Size of Your Long-Context Language Models?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06654v3</link><description>The needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test, which examines the ability to retrievea piece of information (the "needle") from long distractor texts (the"haystack"), has been widely adopted to evaluate long-context language models(LMs). However, this simple retrieval-based test is indicative of only asuperficial form of long-context understanding. To provide a more comprehensiveevaluation of long-context LMs, we create a new synthetic benchmark RULER withflexible configurations for customized sequence length and task complexity.RULER expands upon the vanilla NIAH test to encompass variations with diversetypes and quantities of needles. Moreover, RULER introduces new task categoriesmulti-hop tracing and aggregation to test behaviors beyond searching fromcontext. We evaluate 17 long-context LMs with 13 representative tasks in RULER.Despite achieving nearly perfect accuracy in the vanilla NIAH test, almost allmodels exhibit large performance drops as the context length increases. Whilethese models all claim context sizes of 32K tokens or greater, only half ofthem can maintain satisfactory performance at the length of 32K. Our analysisof Yi-34B, which supports context length of 200K, reveals large room forimprovement as we increase input length and task complexity.

A key challenge in this field iscatastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge whenlearning new tasks. Existing methods commonly employ multipleparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) blocks to acquire task-specificknowledge for each task, but these approaches lack efficiency and overlook thepotential for knowledge transfer through task interaction. In this paper, wepresent a novel CL framework for language models called Task Skill Localizationand Consolidation (TaSL), which enhances knowledge transfer without relying onmemory replay. TaSL first divides the model into `skill units' based onparameter dependencies, enabling more granular control. It then employs a novelgroup-wise skill localization technique to identify the importance distributionof skill units for a new task. By comparing this importance distribution withthose from previous tasks, we implement a fine-grained skill consolidationstrategy that retains task-specific knowledge, thereby preventing forgetting,and updates task-shared knowledge, which facilitates bi-directional knowledgetransfer. As a result, TaSL achieves a superior balance between retainingprevious knowledge and excelling in new tasks. TaSL also shows stronggeneralizability, suitable for general models and customizable for PEFT methodslike LoRA. Additionally, it demonstrates notable extensibility, allowingintegration with memory replay to further enhance performance. Extensiveexperiments on two CL benchmarks, with varying model sizes (from 220M to 7B),demonstrate the effectiveness of TaSL and its variants across differentsettings.</description><author>Yujie Feng, Xu Chu, Yongxin Xu, Zexin Lu, Bo Liu, Philip S.

The goal of modelmerging is to combine multiple models, each excelling in different tasks, intoa single model that outperforms any of the individual source models. However,model merging faces two significant challenges: First, existing methods relyheavily on human intuition and customized strategies to tackle multiple tasks.Second, it's difficult to search for the great model merging configuration inlimited evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-objectiveoptimization based model merging method named MM-MO. The proposed method canautomatically search merging configurations for multiple tasks withmulti-objective optimization algorithms. Moreover, to obtain high-quality modelmerging configurations within a limited number of evaluation iterations, wehave made several improvements to multi-objective Bayesian optimizationspecifically for model merging scenarios. First, we introduced a weak-to-strongmethod to improve the acquisition strategy. Second, we employed Fisherinformation to select configurations, further increasing the chances ofdiscovering superior model merging configurations. Third, we designed asparsity metric as an additional optimization objective to enhance the model'sgeneralization performance across different tasks. We conducted comprehensiveexperiments with other mainstream model merging methods, demonstrating that ourmethod consistently outperforms them.

Unlike general models, whichstrive for broad coverage, these specialized Agents rely on focused datasetstailored to their intended applications. This research proposes a pipeline thatleverages the power of LLMs and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation relatedframework to construct high-quality instruction datasets for fine-tuning onspecific domains using custom document collections. By ingestingdomain-specific documents, the pipeline generates relevant and contextuallyappropriate instructions, thus effectively creating a comprehensive dataset forfine-tuning LLMs on the target domain. This approach overcomes the limitationsof traditional dataset creation methods, which often rely on manual curation orweb-scraping techniques that may introduce noise and irrelevant data. Notably,our pipeline offers a dynamic solution that can quickly adapt to updates ormodifications in the domain-specific document collection, eliminating the needfor complete retraining. Additionally, it addresses the challenge of datascarcity by enabling the generation of instruction datasets from a limited setof initial documents, rendering it suitable for unpopular or specializeddomains where comprehensive datasets are scarce. As a case study, we apply thisapproach to the domain of psychiatry, a field requiring specialized knowledgeand sensitive handling of patient information.

This paper introduces a novel interpretableknowledge distillation approach to enhance the performance of smaller, moreeconomical LLMs that firms can self-host. We study this problem in the contextof building a customer service agent aimed at achieving high customersatisfaction through goal-oriented dialogues. Unlike traditional knowledgedistillation, where the "student" model learns directly from the "teacher"model's responses via fine-tuning, our interpretable "strategy" teachingapproach involves the teacher providing strategies to improve the student'sperformance in various scenarios. This method alternates between a "scenariogeneration" step and a "strategies for improvement" step, creating a customizedlibrary of scenarios and optimized strategies for automated prompting. Themethod requires only black-box access to both student and teacher models; henceit can be used without manipulating model parameters. In our customer serviceapplication, the method improves performance, and the learned strategies aretransferable to other LLMs and scenarios beyond the training set.

This is because code is more tractable than stepsgenerated via Natural Language and make it easy to support more complexsequences by abstracting deterministic logic into functions. It also allowsspotting issues with incorrect function names with the help of parsing checksthat can be run on code. Progress in Code Generation methodologies, however,remains limited to general-purpose languages like C, C++, and Python. LLMscontinue to face challenges with custom function names in Domain SpecificLanguages or DSLs, leading to higher hallucination rates and syntax errors.This is more common for custom function names, that are typically part of theplan. Moreover, keeping LLMs up-to-date with newer function names is an issue.This poses a challenge for scenarios like task planning over a large number ofAPIs, since the plan is represented as a DSL having custom API names. In thispaper, we focus on workflow automation in RPA (Robotic Process Automation)domain as a special case of task planning. We present optimizations for usingRetrieval Augmented Generation (or RAG) with LLMs for DSL generation along withan ablation study comparing these strategies with a fine-tuned model. Ourresults showed that the fine-tuned model scored the best on code similaritymetric. However, with our optimizations, RAG approach is able to match thequality for in-domain API names in the test set. Additionally, it offerssignificant advantage for out-of-domain or unseen API names, outperformingFine-Tuned model on similarity metric by 7 pts.</description><author>Nastaran Bassamzadeh, Chhaya Methani</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 04:29:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08335v1</guid></item><item><title>Customizing Language Models with Instance-wise LoRA for Sequential Recommendation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10159v1</link><description>Sequential recommendation systems predict a user's next item of interest byanalyzing past interactions, aligning recommendations with individualpreferences. Leveraging the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) inknowledge comprehension and reasoning, recent approaches have applied LLMs tosequential recommendation through language generation paradigms. These methodsconvert user behavior sequences into prompts for LLM fine-tuning, utilizingLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules to refine recommendations. However, theuniform application of LoRA across diverse user behaviors sometimes fails tocapture individual variability, leading to suboptimal performance and negativetransfer between disparate sequences. To address these challenges, we proposeInstance-wise LoRA (iLoRA), integrating LoRA with the Mixture of Experts (MoE)framework. iLoRA creates a diverse array of experts, each capturing specificaspects of user preferences, and introduces a sequence representation guidedgate function. This gate function processes historical interaction sequences togenerate enriched representations, guiding the gating network to outputcustomized expert participation weights. This tailored approach mitigatesnegative transfer and dynamically adjusts to diverse behavior patterns.Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectivenessof iLoRA, highlighting its superior performance compared to existing methods incapturing user-specific preferences and improving recommendation accuracy.</description><author>Xiaoyu Kong, Jiancan Wu, An Zhang, Leheng Sheng, Hui Lin, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 17:09:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10159v1</guid></item><item><title>Reconciling Methodological Paradigms: Employing Large Language Models as Novice Qualitative Research Assistants in Talent Management Research</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11043v1</link><description>Qualitative data collection and analysis approaches, such as those employinginterviews and focus groups, provide rich insights into customer attitudes,sentiment, and behavior.

Notably, the advent of powerful Large Language Models(LLMs) has empowered malicious actors to mimic the style of trustworthy newssources, doing so swiftly, cost-effectively, and at scale. Our analysis revealsthat LLM-camouflaged fake news content significantly undermines theeffectiveness of state-of-the-art text-based detectors (up to 38% decrease inF1 Score), implying a severe vulnerability to stylistic variations. To addressthis, we introduce SheepDog, a style-robust fake news detector that prioritizescontent over style in determining news veracity. SheepDog achieves thisresilience through (1) LLM-empowered news reframings that inject stylediversity into the training process by customizing articles to match differentstyles; (2) a style-agnostic training scheme that ensures consistent veracitypredictions across style-diverse reframings; and (3) content-focused veracityattributions that distill content-centric guidelines from LLMs for debunkingfake news, offering supplementary cues and potential intepretability thatassist veracity prediction.

System message, a fundamental component ofLLMs, is consist of carefully crafted instructions that guide the behavior ofmodel to meet intended goals. Despite the recognized potential of systemmessages to optimize AI-driven solutions, there is a notable absence of acomprehensive benchmark for evaluating how well different LLMs follow thesesystem messages. To fill this gap, we introduce SysBench, a benchmark thatsystematically analyzes system message following ability in terms of threechallenging aspects: constraint complexity, instruction misalignment andmulti-turn stability. In order to enable effective evaluation, SysBenchconstructs multi-turn user conversations covering various interactionrelationships, based on six common types of constraints from system messages inreal-world scenarios. Our dataset contains 500 system messages from variousdomains, each paired with 5 turns of user conversations, which have beenmanually formulated and checked to guarantee high quality. SysBench providesextensive evaluation across various LLMs, measuring their ability to followspecified constraints given in system messages. The results highlight both thestrengths and weaknesses of existing models, offering key insights anddirections for future research.

Theirpowerful generative abilities enable flexible responses based on variousqueries or instructions. Emerging as widely adopted generalists for diversetasks, LLMs are still vulnerable to backdoors. This paper proposes anediting-based generative backdoor, named MEGen, aiming to create a customizedbackdoor for NLP tasks with the least side effects. In our approach, we firstleverage a language model to insert a trigger selected on fixed metrics intothe input, then design a pipeline of model editing to directly embed a backdoorinto an LLM. By adjusting a small set of local parameters with a mini-batch ofsamples, MEGen significantly enhances time efficiency and achieves highrobustness. Experimental results indicate that our backdoor attack strategyachieves a high attack success rate on poison data while maintaining themodel's performance on clean data. Notably, the backdoored model, whentriggered, can freely output pre-set dangerous information while successfullycompleting downstream tasks. This suggests that future LLM applications couldbe guided to deliver certain dangerous information, thus altering the LLM'sgenerative style. We believe this approach provides insights for future LLMapplications and the execution of backdoor attacks on conversational AIsystems.</description><author>Jiyang Qiu, Xinbei Ma, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 10:44:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10722v1</guid></item><item><title>Image Score: Learning and Evaluating Human Preferences for Mercari Search</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11349v1</link><description>Mercari is the largest C2C e-commerce marketplace in Japan, having more than20 million active monthly users.

RL algorithms have been instrumentalin maximizing long-term customer satisfaction and avoiding short-term, myopicgoals in industrial recommender systems, which often rely on deep learningmodels to predict immediate clicks or purchases. In this project, several RL methods are implemented and evaluated using theWebShop benchmark environment, data, simulator, and pre-trained modelcheckpoints. The goal is to train an RL agent to maximize the purchase rewardgiven a detailed human instruction describing a desired product. The RL agentsare developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model with various objectives,learning from preferences without a reward model, and employing contemporarytraining techniques such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as used inInstructGPT, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This report alsoevaluates the RL agents trained using generative trajectories. Evaluations wereconducted using Thompson sampling in the WebShop simulator environment. The simulated online experiments demonstrate that agents trained on generatedtrajectories exhibited comparable task performance to those trained using humantrajectories. This has demonstrated an example of an extremely low-costdata-efficient way of training reinforcement learning agents. Also, withlimited training time (&lt;2hours), without utilizing any images, a DPO agentachieved a 19% success rate after approximately 3000 steps or 30 minutes oftraining on T4 GPUs, compared to a PPO agent, which reached a 15% success rate.</description><author>Shuang Feng, Grace Feng</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 10:31:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16032v1</guid></item><item><title>Look, Compare, Decide: Alleviating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models via Multi-View Multi-Path Reasoning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17150v1</link><description>Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressivecapabilities in multi-modal context comprehension. However, they still sufferfrom hallucination problems referring to generating inconsistent outputs withthe image content. To mitigate hallucinations, previous studies mainly focus onretraining LVLMs with custom datasets. Although effective, they inherently comewith additional computational costs. In this paper, we propose a training-freeframework, \textbf{MVP}, that aims to reduce hallucinations by making the mostof the innate capabilities of the LVLMs via \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iewMulti-\textbf{P}ath Reasoning. Specifically, we first devise a multi-viewinformation-seeking strategy to thoroughly perceive the comprehensiveinformation in the image, which enriches the general global informationcaptured by the original vision encoder in LVLMs. Furthermore, during theanswer decoding, we observe that the occurrence of hallucinations has a strongcorrelation with the certainty of the answer tokens. Thus, we proposemulti-path reasoning for each information view to quantify and aggregate thecertainty scores for each potential answer among multiple decoding paths andfinally decide the output answer. By fully grasping the information in theimage and carefully considering the certainty of the potential answers whendecoding, our MVP can effectively reduce hallucinations in LVLMs.The extensiveexperiments verify that our proposed MVP significantly mitigates thehallucination problem across four well-known LVLMs. The source code isavailable at: \url{https://github.com/GasolSun36/MVP}.</description><author>Xiaoye Qu, Jiashuo Sun, Wei Wei, Yu Cheng</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2024 09:40:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17150v1</guid></item><item><title>Manipulating Large Language Models to Increase Product Visibility</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07981v2</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into searchengines to provide natural language responses tailored to user queries.Customers and end-users are also becoming more dependent on these models forquick and easy purchase decisions. In this work, we investigate whetherrecommendations from LLMs can be manipulated to enhance a product's visibility.We demonstrate that adding a strategic text sequence (STS) -- a carefullycrafted message -- to a product's information page can significantly increaseits likelihood of being listed as the LLM's top recommendation. To understandthe impact of STS, we use a catalog of fictitious coffee machines and analyzeits effect on two target products: one that seldom appears in the LLM'srecommendations and another that usually ranks second. We observe that thestrategic text sequence significantly enhances the visibility of both productsby increasing their chances of appearing as the top recommendation. Thisability to manipulate LLM-generated search responses provides vendors with aconsiderable competitive advantage and has the potential to disrupt fair marketcompetition.

This vastly increases the applicability of peerprediction mechanisms as textual feedback is the norm in a large variety offeedback channels: peer reviews, e-commerce customer reviews, and comments onsocial media.

These mechanismsutilize LLMs as predictors, mapping from one agent's report to a prediction ofher peer's report. Theoretically, we show that when the LLM prediction issufficiently accurate, our mechanisms can incentivize high effort andtruth-telling as an (approximate) Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Empirically, weconfirm the efficacy of our mechanisms through experiments conducted on tworeal datasets: the Yelp review dataset and the ICLR OpenReview dataset.

Tothis end, we introduce FastV, a versatile plug-and-play method designed tooptimize computational efficiency by learning adaptive attention patterns inearly layers and pruning visual tokens in subsequent ones. Our evaluationsdemonstrate FastV's ability to dramatically reduce computational costs (e.g., a45 reduction in FLOPs for LLaVA-1.5-13B) without sacrificing performance in awide range of image and video understanding tasks. The computational efficiencyand performance trade-off of FastV are highly customizable andpareto-efficient. It can compress the FLOPs of a 13B-parameter model to achievea lower budget than that of a 7B-parameter model, while still maintainingsuperior performance.

However, achieving effective design andimprovement of reward functions in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks withcomplex custom environments and multiple requirements presents considerablechallenges. In this paper, we enable LLMs to be effective white-box searchers,highlighting their advanced semantic understanding capabilities. Specifically,we generate reward components for each explicit user requirement and employ thereward critic to identify the correct code form. Then, LLMs assign weights tothe reward components to balance their values and iteratively search andoptimize these weights based on the context provided by the training loganalyzer, while adaptively determining the search step size. We applied theframework to an underwater information collection RL task without direct humanfeedback or reward examples (zero-shot). The reward critic successfully correctthe reward code with only one feedback for each requirement, effectivelypreventing irreparable errors that can occur when reward function feedback isprovided in aggregate. The effective initialization of weights enables theacquisition of different reward functions within the Pareto solution setwithout weight search. Even in the case where a weight is 100 times off, fewerthan four iterations are needed to obtain solutions that meet userrequirements. The framework also works well with most prompts utilizing GPT-3.5Turbo, since it does not require advanced numerical understanding orcalculation.</description><author>Guanwen Xie, Jingzehua Xu, Yiyuan Yang, Shuai Zhang</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2024 04:15:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02428v1</guid></item><item><title>How Privacy-Savvy Are Large Language Models? A Case Study on Compliance and Privacy Technical Review</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02375v1</link><description>The recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantlyexpanded their applications across various fields such as language generation,summarization, and complex question answering. However, their application toprivacy compliance and technical privacy reviews remains under-explored,raising critical concerns about their ability to adhere to global privacystandards and protect sensitive user data. This paper seeks to address this gapby providing a comprehensive case study evaluating LLMs' performance inprivacy-related tasks such as privacy information extraction (PIE), legal andregulatory key point detection (KPD), and question answering (QA) with respectto privacy policies and data protection regulations. We introduce a PrivacyTechnical Review (PTR) framework, highlighting its role in mitigating privacyrisks during the software development life-cycle. Through an empiricalassessment, we investigate the capacity of several prominent LLMs, includingBERT, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and custom models, in executing privacy compliance checksand technical privacy reviews. Our experiments benchmark the models acrossmultiple dimensions, focusing on their precision, recall, and F1-scores inextracting privacy-sensitive information and detecting key regulatorycompliance points. While LLMs show promise in automating privacy reviews andidentifying regulatory discrepancies, significant gaps persist in their abilityto fully comply with evolving legal standards. We provide actionablerecommendations for enhancing LLMs' capabilities in privacy compliance,emphasizing the need for robust model improvements and better integration withlegal and regulatory requirements. This study underscores the growingimportance of developing privacy-aware LLMs that can both support businesses incompliance efforts and safeguard user privacy rights.</description><author>Xichou Zhu, Yang Liu, Zhou Shen, Yi Liu, Min Li, Yujun Chen, Benzi John, Zhenzhen Ma, Tao Hu, Bolong Yang, Manman Wang, Zongxing Xie, Peng Liu, Dan Cai, Junhui Wang</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2024 01:51:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02375v1</guid></item><item><title>RAG based Question-Answering for Contextual Response Prediction System</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03708v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown versatility in various NaturalLanguage Processing (NLP) tasks, including their potential as effectivequestion-answering systems.

The level of positiveness of each newsarticle is determined by FinBERT, a natural language processing modelfine-tuned specifically for financial information. Supply chains of firmsacross the world are identified mostly by financial statements, while those ofJapanese firms are taken from large-scale firm-level surveys. We find thatpositive news increases the change rate of stock prices of firms mentioned inthe news before its disclosure, most likely because of diffusion of informationthrough informal channels. Positive news also raises stock prices of the firms'suppliers and customers before its disclosure, confirming propagation of marketvalues through supply chains. In addition, we generally find a larger post-newseffect on stock prices of the mentioned firms and their suppliers and customersthan the pre-news effect. The positive difference between the post- andpre-news effects can be considered as the net effect of the disclosure ofpositive news, controlling for informal information diffusion. However, thepost-news effect on suppliers and customers in Japan is smaller than thepre-news effect, a result opposite to those from firms across the world.

Recently, prompt pretraining in large-scale dataset (e.g.,ImageNet-21K) has played a crucial role in prompt learning for universal visualdiscrimination. However, we revisit and observe that the limited learnableprompts could face underfitting risks given the extensive images during promptpretraining, simultaneously leading to poor generalization. To address theabove issues, in this paper, we propose a general framework termed RevisitingPrompt Pretraining (RPP), which targets at improving the fitting andgeneralization ability from two aspects: prompt structure and promptsupervision. For prompt structure, we break the restriction in common practicewhere query, key, and value vectors are derived from the shared learnableprompt token. Instead, we introduce unshared individual query, key, and valuelearnable prompts, thereby enhancing the model's fitting capacity throughincreased parameter diversity. For prompt supervision, we additionally utilizesoft labels derived from zero-shot probability predictions provided by apretrained Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) teacher model. Thesesoft labels yield more nuanced and general insights into the inter-classrelationships, thereby endowing the pretraining process with bettergeneralization ability. RPP produces a more resilient prompt initialization,enhancing its robust transferability across diverse visual recognition tasks.Experiments across various benchmarks consistently confirm the state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance of our pretrained prompts.

Within dynamic real-world travel scenarios with multi-dimensionalconstraints, services that support users in automatically creating practicaland customized travel itineraries must address three key objectives:Rationality, Comprehensiveness, and Personalization. However, existing systemswith rule-based combinations or LLM-based planning methods struggle to fullysatisfy these criteria. To overcome the challenges, we introduce TravelAgent, atravel planning system powered by large language models (LLMs) designed toprovide reasonable, comprehensive, and personalized travel itineraries groundedin dynamic scenarios. TravelAgent comprises four modules: Tool-usage,Recommendation, Planning, and Memory Module. We evaluate TravelAgent'sperformance with human and simulated users, demonstrating its overalleffectiveness in three criteria and confirming the accuracy of personalizedrecommendations.</description><author>Aili Chen, Xuyang Ge, Ziquan Fu, Yanghua Xiao, Jiangjie Chen</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 14:24:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08069v1</guid></item><item><title>Prompt2Fashion: An automatically generated fashion dataset</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06442v2</link><description>Despite the rapid evolution and increasing efficacy of language and visiongenerative models, there remains a lack of comprehensive datasets that bridgethe gap between personalized fashion needs and AI-driven design, limiting thepotential for truly inclusive and customized fashion solutions. In this work,we leverage generative models to automatically construct a fashion imagedataset tailored to various occasions, styles, and body types as instructed byusers. We use different Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompting strategiesto offer personalized outfits of high aesthetic quality, detail, and relevanceto both expert and non-expert users' requirements, as demonstrated byqualitative analysis. Up until now the evaluation of the generated outfits hasbeen conducted by non-expert human subjects. Despite the provided fine-grainedinsights on the quality and relevance of generation, we extend the discussionon the importance of expert knowledge for the evaluation of artisticAI-generated datasets such as this one.

However, theirunprecedented scale comes with significant computational costs. These models,often consisting of billions of parameters, require vast amounts ofcomputational resources for execution. Especially, the expansive scale andcomputational demands pose considerable challenges when customizing them forparticular downstream tasks, particularly over the hardware platformsconstrained by computational capabilities. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) provides a practical solution by efficiently adjusting the large modelsover the various downstream tasks. In particular, PEFT refers to the process ofadjusting the parameters of a pre-trained large model to adapt it to a specifictask or domain while minimizing the number of additional parameters introducedor computational resources required. This approach is particularly importantwhen dealing with large-scale language models with high parameter counts, asfine-tuning these models from scratch can be computationally expensive andresource-intensive, posing considerable challenges in the supporting systemplatform design. In this survey, we present comprehensive studies of variousPEFT algorithms, examining their performance and computational overhead.Moreover, we provide an overview of applications developed using different PEFTalgorithms and discuss common techniques employed to mitigate computation costsfor PEFT. In addition to providing an extensive survey from an algorithmicstandpoint, we also examine various real-world system designs to investigatethe implementation costs associated with different PEFT approaches. This surveyserves as a valuable resource for researchers aiming to understand both thePEFT algorithm and its system implementation, offering detailed ......</description><author>Zeyu Han, Chao Gao, Jinyang Liu, Jeff Zhang, Sai Qian Zhang</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 02:54:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14608v7</guid></item><item><title>CHOPS: CHat with custOmer Profile Systems for Customer Service with LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01343v3</link><description>Businesses and software platforms are increasingly turning to Large LanguageModels (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GLM-3, and LLaMa-2 for chat assistancewith file access or as reasoning agents for customer service. However, currentLLM-based customer service models have limited integration with customerprofiles and lack the operational capabilities necessary for effective service.Moreover, existing API integrations emphasize diversity over the precision anderror avoidance essential in real-world customer service scenarios. To addressthese issues, we propose an LLM agent named CHOPS (CHat with custOmer Profilein existing System), designed to: (1) efficiently utilize existing databases orsystems for accessing user information or interacting with these systemsfollowing existing guidelines; (2) provide accurate and reasonable responses orcarry out required operations in the system while avoiding harmful operations;and (3) leverage a combination of small and large LLMs to achieve satisfyingperformance at a reasonable inference cost. We introduce a practical dataset,the CPHOS-dataset, which includes a database, guiding files, and QA pairscollected from CPHOS, an online platform that facilitates the organization ofsimulated Physics Olympiads for high school teachers and students. We haveconducted extensive experiments to validate the performance of our proposedCHOPS architecture using the CPHOS-dataset, with the aim of demonstrating howLLMs can enhance or serve as alternatives to human customer service.
