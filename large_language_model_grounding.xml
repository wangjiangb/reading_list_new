Inthis paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. Toachieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMsand demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our methodinvolves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guidethe MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models toindependently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model'soutput. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inferenceprocess in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance ofeach reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade offobject precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by givingcontrol over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user tocontrol the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree ofvisual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucinationbenchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLMinference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigationmethods.</description><author>Oscar Ma√±as, Pierluca D'Oro, Koustuv Sinha, Adriana Romero-Soriano, Michal Drozdzal, Aishwarya Agrawal</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 17:29:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11616v1</guid></item><item><title>Reinforcing Video Reasoning Segmentation to Think Before It Segments</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11538v1</link><description>Video reasoning segmentation (VRS) endeavors to delineate referred objects invideos guided by implicit instructions that encapsulate human intent andtemporal logic. Previous approaches leverage large vision language models(LVLMs) to encode object semantics into &lt;SEG&gt; tokens for mask prediction.However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inferenceand suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawinginspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduceVeason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning insegmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, wecurate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoningtrajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding,yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPOfine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space byoptimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic rewardmechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporalconsistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding.Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achievesstate-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art bysignificant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &amp;F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &amp;F in ReasonVOS),while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R). Our code and modelweights will be available at Veason-R1.</description><author>Sitong Gong, Lu Zhang, Yunzhi Zhuge, Xu Jia, Pingping Zhang, Huchuan Lu</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 15:34:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11538v1</guid></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Perspective on Explainable AI across the Machine Learning Workflow</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11529v1</link><description>Artificial intelligence is reshaping science and industry, yet many usersstill regard its models as opaque "black boxes". Conventional explainableartificial-intelligence methods clarify individual predictions but overlook theupstream decisions and downstream quality checks that determine whetherinsights can be trusted. In this work, we present Holistic ExplainableArtificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embedsexplanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors thoseexplanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up,learning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into asingle taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts,data analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs;our survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded intheories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction andfindings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics thatmake explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable. A comprehensivetaxonomy operationalises these insights, reducing terminological ambiguity andenabling rigorous coverage analysis of existing toolchains. We furtherdemonstrate how AI agents that embed large-language models can orchestratediverse explanation techniques, translating technical artifacts intostakeholder-specific narratives that bridge the gap between AI developers anddomain experts. Departing from traditional surveys or perspective articles,this work melds concepts from multiple disciplines, lessons from real-worldprojects and a critical synthesis of the literature to advance a novel,end-to-end viewpoint on transparency, trustworthiness and responsible AIdeployment.</description><author>George Paterakis, Andrea Castellani, George Papoutsoglou, Tobias Rodemann, Ioannis Tsamardinos</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 15:15:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11529v1</guid></item><item><title>UI-Venus Technical Report: Building High-performance UI Agents with RFT</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10833v2</link><description>We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as inputbased on a multimodal large language model.

Existing methodsfor MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensivefine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. Inthis paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modalChain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential ofunified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structurepersonalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1)grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-providedimages and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditionedon both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To furtherenhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal PolicyOptimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstratethat MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs togenerate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in azero-shot manner.</description><author>Qian Liang, Yujia Wu, Kuncheng Li, Jiwei Wei, Shiyuan He, Jinyu Guo, Ning Xie</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 12:20:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11433v1</guid></item><item><title>MCA-Bench: A Multimodal Benchmark for Evaluating CAPTCHA Robustness Against VLM-based Attacks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05982v4</link><description>As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a criticaldefense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemesencompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text andobfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-basedquestions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodalbenchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address thisgap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarkingsuite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluationprotocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tunespecialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent,cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bencheffectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs undervaried attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis ofhow challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate.Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles andidentify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHAhardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration.

However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes,large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of languagereferences. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of naturallanguage training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learnfrom little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address thesechallenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributesfrom 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with theability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning.Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and canbe applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achievesstate-of-the-art zero-shot performance on complex view-dependent groundingtasks on two benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on twoautonomous vehicles and demonstrate that our approach can be used forobject-goal navigation on previously unseen real-world environments.

However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly duringthe iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusionalleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, thoughat the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such asRetrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioningdenoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. Whileeffective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage andretrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP forsimilarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the PrototypeDiffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directlyinto the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning -without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDMconstructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image featuresusing contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps byaligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns,enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments showthat PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational andstorage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-basedconditioning in diffusion models.</description><author>Bilal Faye, Hanane Azzag, Mustapha Lebbah</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 21:24:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09922v2</guid></item><item><title>Approaching the Source of Symbol Grounding with Confluent Reductions of Abstract Meaning Representation Directed Graphs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11068v1</link><description>Abstract meaning representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism used torepresent the meaning of sentences as directed acyclic graphs.

This makes it difficult todistinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawedreasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visualUnderstanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating thecross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models(AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions acrosssix challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempoand AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skillprofiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. Thisforces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio andvideo, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. Toassess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addressesthe lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposesreasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning isgrounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validityof each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a criticalreasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks),their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. Thisdiscrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers throughflawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way formore robust multimodal evaluation.</description><author>Siminfar Samakoush Galougah, Rishie Raj, Sanjoy Chowdhury, Sayan Nag, Ramani Duraiswami</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:39:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07470v2</guid></item><item><title>CUS-QA: Local-Knowledge-Oriented Open-Ended Question Answering Dataset</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22752v2</link><description>We introduce CUS-QA, a benchmark for open-ended regional question answeringthat encompasses both textual and visual modalities.

Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves a target imagefrom a gallery based on an image-level description, while Referring ExpressionComprehension (REC) localizes a target object within a given image using aninstance-level description. However, real-world applications often present morecomplex demands. Users typically query an instance-level description across alarge gallery and expect to receive both relevant image and the correspondinginstance location. In such scenarios, TIR struggles with fine-graineddescriptions and object-level localization, while REC is limited in its abilityto efficiently search large galleries and lacks an effective ranking mechanism.In this paper, we introduce a new task called \textbf{Referring ExpressionInstance Retrieval (REIR)}, which supports both instance-level retrieval andlocalization based on fine-grained referring expressions. First, we propose alarge-scale benchmark for REIR, named REIRCOCO, constructed by promptingadvanced vision-language models to generate high-quality referring expressionsfor instances in the MSCOCO and RefCOCO datasets. Second, we present a baselinemethod, Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment with Relation Experts (CLARE),which employs a dual-stream architecture to address REIR in an end-to-endmanner. Given a referring expression, the textual branch encodes it into aquery embedding. The visual branch detects candidate objects and extracts theirinstance-level visual features. The most similar candidate to the query isselected for bounding box prediction. CLARE is first trained on objectdetection and REC datasets to establish initial grounding capabilities, thenoptimized via Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment (CLIA) for improvedretrieval across images. We will release our code and benchmark publicly.</description><author>Xiangzhao Hao, Kuan Zhu, Hongyu Guo, Haiyun Guo, Ning Jiang, Quan Lu, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 09:45:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18246v4</guid></item><item><title>On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06382v5</link><description>This paper establishes a fundamental impossibility theorem: no LLM capable ofperforming non-trivial knowledge aggregation can simultaneously achievetruthful knowledge representation, semantic information conservation, completerevelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality. Theimpossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematicalstructure of information aggregation itself. We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction ofideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledgeto shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains:mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules(Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Expconvexity). In particular, we show how to quantify the creation ofoverconfident or intuitive responses-the signature of both hallucination andcreativity, or imagination. To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of thesemantic information measure and the emergence operator to model boundedreasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generatesaccessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, theidealized unconstrained reasoning strictly preserves semantic content. By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematicallyidentical phenomena-grounded in departures from truthfulness, semanticinformation conservation, revelation of relevant knowledge, andknowledge-constrained optimality-we offer a principled foundation for managingthese behaviors in advanced AI systems. Finally, we present some speculativeideas to inspire evaluation and refinements of the proposed theory.</description><author>Micha≈Ç P.

In this paper, we introduce Grounded-VideoLLM,a novel Video-LLM adept at perceiving and reasoning over specific video momentsin a fine-grained manner. We identify that current Video-LLMs have limitationsfor fine-grained video understanding since they lack effective temporalmodeling and timestamp representation. In light of this, we sharpen our modelby incorporating (1) an additional temporal stream to encode the relationshipsbetween frames and (2) discrete temporal tokens enriched with specific timeknowledge to represent timestamps. To optimize the training ofGrounded-VideoLLM, we employ a multi-stage training scheme, beginning withsimple video-captioning tasks and progressively introducing video temporalgrounding tasks of increasing complexity. To further enhanceGrounded-VideoLLM's temporal reasoning capability, we also curate a groundedVideoQA dataset by an automatic annotation pipeline. Extensive experimentsdemonstrate that Grounded-VideoLLM not only excels in fine-grained groundingtasks such as temporal sentence grounding, dense video captioning, and groundedVideoQA, but also shows great potential as a versatile video assistant forgeneral video understanding.</description><author>Haibo Wang, Zhiyang Xu, Yu Cheng, Shizhe Diao, Yufan Zhou, Yixin Cao, Qifan Wang, Weifeng Ge, Lifu Huang</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 05:15:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03290v2</guid></item><item><title>WangchanThaiInstruct: An instruction-following Dataset for Culture-Aware, Multitask, and Multi-domain Evaluation in Thai</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15239v1</link><description>Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but theirperformance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored.

However, due to the extendedtrajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLNperformance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overlydetailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, whichcould provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motionspace for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAVCollaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinctaltitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the trainingand evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired withtarget-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen mapsand an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model'sgeneralization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAVcollaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates amultimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while thelow-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation andtarget grounding.

However,existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real applicationchallenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. Toaddress this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensivebenchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasksthrough interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, RepositoryManagement, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and WebSearching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-basedevaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, staticevaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators thatautomatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA modelssuch as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibitsignificant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses asignificant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of inputtokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, itintroduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiaritywith the precise usage of the MCP servers.

The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes tomodel training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, manyof these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample'sinfluence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutivelearning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate thesample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences acrosssuccessive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, weapproximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating theneed for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being asecond-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable tothat of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achievedby computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficientlyapproximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess theapproximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Ourtheoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lowerapproximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensiveexperiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmarkdatasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coresetselection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scalevision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of datapoints and outperforms strong baselines.</description><author>Haoru Tan, Sitong Wu, Xiuzhe Wu, Wang Wang, Bo Zhao, Zeke Xie, Gui-Song Xia, Xiaojuan Qi</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 11:59:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14648v1</guid></item><item><title>STEM: Efficient Relative Capability Evaluation of LLMs through Structured Transition Samples</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12096v2</link><description>Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly challengingas model capabilities advance rapidly.

However, current approaches largely rely on predefinedthreat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to exposediverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, aframework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoningnovel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-ScenarioGeneration, where a large language model, grounded in structured drivingknowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that isboth plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is thenspecified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threatintroduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph toidentify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations aredesigned to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space andcreate critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiplereinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severecollision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, ourScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on differentsimulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenariosimproves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework throughreal-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generatedscenarios are both plausible and critical.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown greatpromise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relationclassification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a relatedentity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determinewhether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentencestructures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Suchhallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising theintegrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address thesechallenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-awaresEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into therelation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,DEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations foreach pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentenceinto a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noisewhile preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all localpredictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,correcting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce acausality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentanglingspurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learningwith human feedback.

Existing Turkish benchmarks often lackeither task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addressesthese gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generativetasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness ofTurkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, andquestion answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. Weevaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different modelfamilies and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centricinstruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual orgeneral-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored forthe language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correctionand extractive question answering are particularly discriminative indifferentiating model capabilities.

Recent work suggests thatLLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance andgenerating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merelyimprovising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixedplanning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. Todistinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we presentformal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalizethem as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to bothbase and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generationbenchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previouslyshown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku,Gemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and onMBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks andeven successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuningrefines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating themfrom scratch. Together, these studies provide a reproducible and scalablefoundation for mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs.</description><author>Jatin Nainani, Sankaran Vaidyanathan, Connor Watts, Andre N.

Investigating the Use of LLMs as Judges</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18076v1</link><description>Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems remains a core challengeof natural language processing (NLP), further complicated by the rise of largelanguage models (LLMs) that aims to be general-purpose. Recently, largelanguage models as judges (LLJs) have emerged as a promising alternative totraditional metrics, but their validity remains underexplored. This positionpaper argues that the current enthusiasm around LLJs may be premature, as theiradoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of their reliability and validity asevaluators. Drawing on measurement theory from the social sciences, we identifyand critically assess four core assumptions underlying the use of LLJs: theirability to act as proxies for human judgment, their capabilities as evaluators,their scalability, and their cost-effectiveness. We examine how each of theseassumptions may be challenged by the inherent limitations of LLMs, LLJs, orcurrent practices in NLG evaluation. To ground our analysis, we explore threeapplications of LLJs: text summarization, data annotation, and safetyalignment. Finally, we highlight the need for more responsible evaluationpractices in LLJs evaluation, to ensure that their growing role in the fieldsupports, rather than undermines, progress in NLG.</description><author>Khaoula Chehbouni, Mohammed Haddou, Jackie Chi Kit Cheung, Golnoosh Farnadi</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 14:43:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18076v1</guid></item><item><title>A holistic perception system of internal and external monitoring for ground autonomous vehicles: AutoTRUST paradigm</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17969v1</link><description>This paper introduces a holistic perception system for internal and externalmonitoring of autonomous vehicles, with the aim of demonstrating a novelAI-leveraged self-adaptive framework of advanced vehicle technologies andsolutions that optimize perception and experience on-board.

However, they remain limited by static training data,susceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to verify claims againstup-to-date, external evidence, compromising their performance in dynamicreal-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers apractical solution to mitigate these challenges by allowing the LVLMs to accesslarge-scale knowledge databases via retrieval mechanisms, thereby groundingmodel outputs in factual, contextually relevant information. Here in thispaper, we conduct the first systematic dissection of the multimodal RAGpipeline for LVLMs, explicitly investigating (1) the retrieval phase: on themodality configurations and retrieval strategies, (2) the re-ranking stage: onstrategies to mitigate positional biases and improve the relevance of retrievedevidence, and (3) the generation phase: we further investigate how to bestintegrate retrieved candidates into the final generation process. Finally, weextend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking andgeneration through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidenceand suppress irrelevant context dynamically. Our full-stack exploration of RAGfor LVLMs yields substantial insights, resulting in an average performanceboost of 5% without any fine-tuning.</description><author>Chan-Wei Hu, Yueqi Wang, Shuo Xing, Chia-Ju Chen, Suofei Feng, Ryan Rossi, Zhengzhong Tu</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 16:42:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24073v2</guid></item><item><title>Dual Enhancement on 3D Vision-Language Perception for Monocular 3D Visual Grounding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19165v1</link><description>Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objectsin RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the textembeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largelyignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistantmapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads tosevere performance degradation, even though the physical length remainsequivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trainedlanguage model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3Dperception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on textembeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between differentunits by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to furtherenhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features intogeometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are thenleveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluatethe proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on theMono3DRefer dataset.

This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs canacquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or withoutauxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare toparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its scriptare extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL withlanguage alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resourcelanguages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languagesrelatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working onextremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by ourresults on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuninga multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.</description><author>Yue Li, Zhixue Zhao, Carolina Scarton</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 14:51:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19089v1</guid></item><item><title>Sense of Self and Time in Borderline Personality.

However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness ofthese systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly onwhether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protectingsensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems haveprimarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attentionhas been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets,despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. Inthis work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating syntheticQA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacypreservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveragingclustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability,(2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multipledomains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QApairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experimentsdemonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversityand achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets.

However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly duringthe iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusionalleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, thoughat the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such asRetrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioningdenoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. Whileeffective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage andretrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP forsimilarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the PrototypeDiffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directlyinto the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning -without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDMconstructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image featuresusing contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps byaligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns,enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments showthat PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational andstorage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-basedconditioning in diffusion models.</description><author>Bilal Faye, Hanane Azzag, Mustapha Lebbah</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 10:29:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09922v4</guid></item><item><title>Interactive Evaluation of Large Language Models for Multi-Requirement Software Engineering Tasks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18905v1</link><description>Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuancedcapabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as softwareengineering.

However, current LLMs are oftenobserved to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon knownas "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs'verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, suchas "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on promptengineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates,both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by thenotion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learningmodels, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method thatintroduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scoresor proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function,tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoringrule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to reportits true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration acrossdiverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Ourresults further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gainsin self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthyLLM systems.

Nevertheless,existing 3D visual grounding approaches require a substantial number ofbounding box annotations for text queries, which is time-consuming andlabor-intensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose 3D-VLA, a weaklysupervised approach for 3D visual grounding based on Visual LinguisticAlignment. Our 3D-VLA exploits the superior ability of current large-scalevision-language models (VLMs) on aligning the semantics between texts and 2Dimages, as well as the naturally existing correspondences between 2D images and3D point clouds, and thus implicitly constructs correspondences between textsand 3D point clouds with no need for fine-grained box annotations in thetraining procedure. During the inference stage, the learned text-3Dcorrespondence will help us ground the text queries to the 3D target objectseven without 2D images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work toinvestigate 3D visual grounding in a weakly supervised manner by involvinglarge scale vision-language models, and extensive experiments on ReferIt3D andScanRefer datasets demonstrate that our 3D-VLA achieves comparable and evensuperior results over the fully supervised methods.</description><author>Xiaoxu Xu, Yitian Yuan, Qiudan Zhang, Wenhui Wu, Zequn Jie, Lin Ma, Xu Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 08:50:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09625v5</guid></item><item><title>Insights into User Interface Innovations from a Design Thinking Workshop at deRSE25</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18784v1</link><description>Large Language Models have become widely adopted tools due to their versatilecapabilities, yet their user interfaces remain limited, often following rigid,linear interaction paradigms.

Existing single-agentapproaches, however, remain limited by structural constraints. Althoughmulti-agent systems naturally decouple different competencies, recent progressin multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has often been hindered byinefficiency and remains incompatible with current LVLM architectures. Toaddress these challenges, we introduce SWIRL, a staged workflow for interleavedreinforcement learning designed for multi-agent systems. SWIRL reformulatesMARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating oneagent at a time while keeping the others fixed. This formulation enables stabletraining and promotes efficient coordination across agents. Theoretically, weprovide a stepwise safety bound, a cross-round monotonic improvement theorem,and convergence guarantees on return, ensuring robust and principledoptimization. In application to mobile GUI control, SWIRL instantiates aNavigator that converts language and screen context into structured plans, andan Interactor that grounds these plans into executable atomic actions.Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on both high-level andlow-level GUI benchmarks. Beyond GUI tasks, SWIRL also demonstrates strongcapability in multi-agent mathematical reasoning, underscoring its potential asa general framework for developing efficient and robust multi-agent systems.</description><author>Quanfeng Lu, Zhantao Ma, Shuai Zhong, Jin Wang, Dahai Yu, Michael K.

This researchexplores the sentiment of large language models (LLMs) and humans towardartificial general intelligence (AGI) using a Likert-scale survey. Seven LLMs,including GPT-4 and Bard, were analyzed and compared with sentiment data fromthree independent human sample populations. Temporal variations in sentimentwere also evaluated over three consecutive days. The results show a diversityin sentiment scores among LLMs, ranging from 3.32 to 4.12 out of 5. GPT-4recorded the most positive sentiment toward AGI, while Bard leaned toward aneutral sentiment. In contrast, the human samples showed a lower averagesentiment of 2.97. The analysis outlines potential conflicts of interest andbiases in the sentiment formation of LLMs, and indicates that LLMs could subtlyinfluence societal perceptions.

Thisbenchmark is designed to guide policymakers and AI agencies, including withinframeworks such as the EU AI Act, by providing robust, actionable insights intoAI alignment with human values, public sentiment, and ethical norms at bothnational and international levels.

CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and isaccompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise PreferenceAccuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and findthat even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy orinsecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conductpreliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourageretrievers to recognize code quality.

However, most of thisresearch has focused on native English speakers learning other languages,rather than the reverse. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novelcross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequencebased on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics. Weevaluate PhoniTale using both automated metrics and human evaluations,comparing its output to mnemonics created by humans and by previous automatedapproaches. To assess practical effectiveness, we also conduct a short-termrecall test measuring mnemonic helpfulness. Our findings show that PhoniTaleperforms comparably to human-authored mnemonics. We also highlight key areasfor future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.</description><author>Sana Kang, Myeongseok Gwon, Su Young Kwon, Jaewook Lee, Andrew Lan, Bhiksha Raj, Rita Singh</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 09:29:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05444v2</guid></item><item><title>Understanding and Leveraging the Expert Specialization of Context Faithfulness in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19594v1</link><description>Context faithfulness is essential for reliable reasoning in context-dependentscenarios. However, large language models often struggle to ground theiroutputs in the provided context, resulting in irrelevant responses. Inspired bythe emergent expert specialization observed in mixture-of-expertsarchitectures, this work investigates whether certain experts exhibitspecialization in context utilization, offering a potential pathway towardtargeted optimization for improved context faithfulness. To explore this, wepropose Router Lens, a method that accurately identifies context-faithfulexperts. Our analysis reveals that these experts progressively amplifyattention to relevant contextual information, thereby enhancing contextgrounding. Building on this insight, we introduce Context-faithful ExpertFine-Tuning (CEFT), a lightweight optimization approach that selectivelyfine-tunes context-faithful experts. Experiments across a wide range ofbenchmarks and models demonstrate that CEFT matches or surpasses theperformance of full fine-tuning while being significantly more efficient.</description><author>Jun Bai, Minghao Tong, Yang Liu, Zixia Jia, Zilong Zheng</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 06:07:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19594v1</guid></item><item><title>NPHardEval4V: Dynamic Evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models with Effects of Vision</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01777v3</link><description>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressivecapabilities in multimodal understanding, yet their reasoning abilities remainunderexplored. Existing benchmarks tend to focus on perception or text-basedcomprehension, offering limited insight into how well these models perform onstructured, logic-driven tasks that require both visual and linguisticreasoning. To address this gap, we introduce NPHardEval4V, a multimodalbenchmark suite grounded in four classical NP-hard problems: Knapsack, SetCover, Traveling Salesperson, and Vertex Cover. Each task is presented througha combination of structured visual layouts and textual prompts, designed toassess the ability of LVLMs to perform combinatorial reasoning undervisual-linguistic constraints. We evaluate a set of advanced open-source andclosed-source vision-language models under a unified prompting and problemrepresentation framework. This enables fair comparison across models and tasktypes, while isolating key variables affecting performance. Our results showthat while these models perform reasonably well on perception-based inputs,they struggle with global optimization, abstraction, and constraintsatisfaction. No single model demonstrates consistent reasoning capabilityacross all problem types, and common failure patterns reveal fundamentallimitations in current architectures. By leveraging the structure andcomplexity of NP-hard problems, NPHardEval4V provides a scalable,interpretable, and challenging testbed for diagnosing reasoning behaviors inLVLMs. We hope this benchmark can support the community in building morerobust, inference-capable multimodal systems.

However, it is not straightforward to apply thesemethods directly for a more real-world use case of visualizing data from longdocuments based on user-given intents, as opposed to the user pre-selecting therelevant content manually. We introduce the task of intent-based chartgeneration from documents: given a user-specified intent and document(s), thegoal is to generate a chart adhering to the intent and grounded on thedocument(s) in a zero-shot setting. We propose an unsupervised, two-stagedframework in which an LLM first extracts relevant information from thedocument(s) by decomposing the intent and iteratively validates and refinesthis data. Next, a heuristic-guided module selects an appropriate chart typebefore final code generation. To assess the data accuracy of the generatedcharts, we propose an attribution-based metric that uses a structured textualrepresentation of charts, instead of relying on visual decoding metrics thatoften fail to capture the chart data effectively. To validate our approach, wecurate a dataset comprising of 1,242 $&lt;$intent, document, charts$&gt;$ tuples fromtwo domains, finance and scientific, in contrast to the existing datasets thatare largely limited to parallel text descriptions/ tables and theircorresponding charts. We compare our approach with baselines using single-shotchart generation using LLMs and query-based retrieval methods; our methodoutperforms by upto $9$ points and $17$ points in terms of chart data accuracyand chart type respectively over the best baselines.</description><author>Akriti Jain, Pritika Ramu, Aparna Garimella, Apoorv Saxena</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 04:57:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14819v2</guid></item><item><title>X-Troll: eXplainable Detection of State-Sponsored Information Operations Agents</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16021v2</link><description>State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguisticmanipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to onlinediscourse integrity.

Structured Approach with Causal Chains as Intermediate Representations for Improved and Explainable Causal Video Question Answering</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21010v1</link><description>Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often strugglewith higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines thatentangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. Theseblack-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend onshallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitlydecouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural languagecausal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by humancognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-levelvideo content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent andlogically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a CausalChain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded inthese chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce ascalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existingdatasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluationmetric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scalebenchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-artmodels, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, andgeneralization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engineacross diverse domains.

We present MAPTA, a multi-agent system for autonomous web applicationsecurity assessment that combines large language model orchestration withtool-grounded execution and end-to-end exploit validation. On the 104-challengeXBOW benchmark, MAPTA achieves 76.9% overall success with perfect performanceon SSRF and misconfiguration vulnerabilities, 83% success on brokenauthorization, and strong results on injection attacks including server-sidetemplate injection (85%) and SQL injection (83%). Cross-site scripting (57%)and blind SQL injection (0%) remain challenging. Our comprehensive costanalysis across all challenges totals $21.38 with a median cost of $0.073 forsuccessful attempts versus $0.357 for failures. Success correlates stronglywith resource efficiency, enabling practical early-stopping thresholds atapproximately 40 tool calls or $0.30 per challenge. MAPTA's real-world findings are impactful given both the popularity of therespective scanned GitHub repositories (8K-70K stars) and MAPTA's low averageoperating cost of $3.67 per open-source assessment: MAPTA discovered criticalvulnerabilities including RCEs, command injections, secret exposure, andarbitrary file write vulnerabilities.

However, effectively aligning thesemodalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--wheregenerated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safetyconcerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such asinstruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability andincrease costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach thatgenerates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric createdinternally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables themodel to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decodingstrategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reducedhallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability.

Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieveperformance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting itspotential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, itsuffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioningerrors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanismsand limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novelcaptioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption qualitythrough improved visual grounding.

Current approachesoften adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM)makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities,including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memoryoverload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, wepropose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modulesinto a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into arobust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module,a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective nodepruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatialreasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition;and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robustactions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space(I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp),which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achievinghigher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on theRoom-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-artperformance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Successweighted by Path Length (SPL).</description><author>Chenghao Liu, Zhimu Zhou, Jiachen Zhang, Minghao Zhang, Songfang Huang, Huiling Duan</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 07:54:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16654v2</guid></item><item><title>Profile-Aware Maneuvering: A Dynamic Multi-Agent System for Robust GAIA Problem Solving by AWorld</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09889v4</link><description>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has empoweredintelligent agents to leverage diverse external tools for solving complexreal-world problems. However, this reliance introduces new challenges, asextended contexts and noisy tool outputs can undermine system reliability. Toaddress this, we propose a dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS) in our AWorldframework, where an Execution Agent is supervised by a Guard Agent thatprovides on-demand dynamic maneuvering, verifying and correcting the reasoningprocess to improve robustness over single-agent systems. To move beyond thisgeneric supervision, we enhance the architecture with a methodology inspired bySystem Identification from control theory. This method first profiles theExecution Agent offline on a benchmark dataset to create a "performancefingerprint" of its unique weaknesses. The Guard Agent then leverages thisfingerprint online to deliver profile-aware supervision, making targetedinterventions based on known failure patterns rather than merely reacting toimmediate logical flaws. Extensive experiments on the GAIA dataset demonstratethat this profile-aware MAS significantly improves both effectiveness andstability, outperforming not only single-agent systems but also its naivecounterpart. This superior performance led our system to achieve first placeamong open-source projects on the prestigious GAIA leaderboard. These findingshighlight that building truly trustworthy intelligent systems requires not justcollaboration, but a deep, empirically-grounded understanding of each agent'sunique capabilities and limitations.</description><author>Zhitian Xie, Qintong Wu, Chengyue Yu, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 02:41:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09889v4</guid></item></channel></rss>
