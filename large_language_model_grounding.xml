Inthis paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. Toachieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMsand demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our methodinvolves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guidethe MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models toindependently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model'soutput. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inferenceprocess in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance ofeach reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade offobject precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by givingcontrol over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user tocontrol the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree ofvisual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucinationbenchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLMinference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigationmethods.</description><author>Oscar Ma√±as, Pierluca D'Oro, Koustuv Sinha, Adriana Romero-Soriano, Michal Drozdzal, Aishwarya Agrawal</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 17:29:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11616v1</guid></item><item><title>Reinforcing Video Reasoning Segmentation to Think Before It Segments</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11538v1</link><description>Video reasoning segmentation (VRS) endeavors to delineate referred objects invideos guided by implicit instructions that encapsulate human intent andtemporal logic. Previous approaches leverage large vision language models(LVLMs) to encode object semantics into &lt;SEG&gt; tokens for mask prediction.However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inferenceand suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawinginspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduceVeason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning insegmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, wecurate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoningtrajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding,yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPOfine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space byoptimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic rewardmechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporalconsistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding.Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achievesstate-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art bysignificant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &amp;F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &amp;F in ReasonVOS),while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R). Our code and modelweights will be available at Veason-R1.</description><author>Sitong Gong, Lu Zhang, Yunzhi Zhuge, Xu Jia, Pingping Zhang, Huchuan Lu</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 15:34:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11538v1</guid></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Perspective on Explainable AI across the Machine Learning Workflow</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11529v1</link><description>Artificial intelligence is reshaping science and industry, yet many usersstill regard its models as opaque "black boxes". Conventional explainableartificial-intelligence methods clarify individual predictions but overlook theupstream decisions and downstream quality checks that determine whetherinsights can be trusted. In this work, we present Holistic ExplainableArtificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embedsexplanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors thoseexplanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up,learning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into asingle taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts,data analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs;our survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded intheories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction andfindings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics thatmake explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable. A comprehensivetaxonomy operationalises these insights, reducing terminological ambiguity andenabling rigorous coverage analysis of existing toolchains. We furtherdemonstrate how AI agents that embed large-language models can orchestratediverse explanation techniques, translating technical artifacts intostakeholder-specific narratives that bridge the gap between AI developers anddomain experts. Departing from traditional surveys or perspective articles,this work melds concepts from multiple disciplines, lessons from real-worldprojects and a critical synthesis of the literature to advance a novel,end-to-end viewpoint on transparency, trustworthiness and responsible AIdeployment.</description><author>George Paterakis, Andrea Castellani, George Papoutsoglou, Tobias Rodemann, Ioannis Tsamardinos</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 15:15:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11529v1</guid></item><item><title>UI-Venus Technical Report: Building High-performance UI Agents with RFT</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10833v2</link><description>We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as inputbased on a multimodal large language model.

Existing methodsfor MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensivefine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. Inthis paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modalChain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential ofunified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structurepersonalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1)grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-providedimages and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditionedon both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To furtherenhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal PolicyOptimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstratethat MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs togenerate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in azero-shot manner.</description><author>Qian Liang, Yujia Wu, Kuncheng Li, Jiwei Wei, Shiyuan He, Jinyu Guo, Ning Xie</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 12:20:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11433v1</guid></item><item><title>MCA-Bench: A Multimodal Benchmark for Evaluating CAPTCHA Robustness Against VLM-based Attacks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05982v4</link><description>As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a criticaldefense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemesencompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text andobfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-basedquestions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodalbenchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address thisgap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarkingsuite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluationprotocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tunespecialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent,cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bencheffectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs undervaried attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis ofhow challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate.Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles andidentify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHAhardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration.

However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes,large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of languagereferences. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of naturallanguage training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learnfrom little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address thesechallenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributesfrom 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with theability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning.Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and canbe applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achievesstate-of-the-art zero-shot performance on complex view-dependent groundingtasks on two benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on twoautonomous vehicles and demonstrate that our approach can be used forobject-goal navigation on previously unseen real-world environments.

However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly duringthe iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusionalleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, thoughat the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such asRetrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioningdenoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. Whileeffective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage andretrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP forsimilarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the PrototypeDiffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directlyinto the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning -without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDMconstructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image featuresusing contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps byaligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns,enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments showthat PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational andstorage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-basedconditioning in diffusion models.</description><author>Bilal Faye, Hanane Azzag, Mustapha Lebbah</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 21:24:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09922v2</guid></item><item><title>Approaching the Source of Symbol Grounding with Confluent Reductions of Abstract Meaning Representation Directed Graphs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11068v1</link><description>Abstract meaning representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism used torepresent the meaning of sentences as directed acyclic graphs.

This makes it difficult todistinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawedreasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visualUnderstanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating thecross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models(AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions acrosssix challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempoand AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skillprofiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. Thisforces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio andvideo, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. Toassess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addressesthe lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposesreasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning isgrounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validityof each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a criticalreasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks),their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. Thisdiscrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers throughflawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way formore robust multimodal evaluation.</description><author>Siminfar Samakoush Galougah, Rishie Raj, Sanjoy Chowdhury, Sayan Nag, Ramani Duraiswami</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:39:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07470v2</guid></item><item><title>CUS-QA: Local-Knowledge-Oriented Open-Ended Question Answering Dataset</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22752v2</link><description>We introduce CUS-QA, a benchmark for open-ended regional question answeringthat encompasses both textual and visual modalities.

Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves a target imagefrom a gallery based on an image-level description, while Referring ExpressionComprehension (REC) localizes a target object within a given image using aninstance-level description. However, real-world applications often present morecomplex demands. Users typically query an instance-level description across alarge gallery and expect to receive both relevant image and the correspondinginstance location. In such scenarios, TIR struggles with fine-graineddescriptions and object-level localization, while REC is limited in its abilityto efficiently search large galleries and lacks an effective ranking mechanism.In this paper, we introduce a new task called \textbf{Referring ExpressionInstance Retrieval (REIR)}, which supports both instance-level retrieval andlocalization based on fine-grained referring expressions. First, we propose alarge-scale benchmark for REIR, named REIRCOCO, constructed by promptingadvanced vision-language models to generate high-quality referring expressionsfor instances in the MSCOCO and RefCOCO datasets. Second, we present a baselinemethod, Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment with Relation Experts (CLARE),which employs a dual-stream architecture to address REIR in an end-to-endmanner. Given a referring expression, the textual branch encodes it into aquery embedding. The visual branch detects candidate objects and extracts theirinstance-level visual features. The most similar candidate to the query isselected for bounding box prediction. CLARE is first trained on objectdetection and REC datasets to establish initial grounding capabilities, thenoptimized via Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment (CLIA) for improvedretrieval across images. We will release our code and benchmark publicly.</description><author>Xiangzhao Hao, Kuan Zhu, Hongyu Guo, Haiyun Guo, Ning Jiang, Quan Lu, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 09:45:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18246v4</guid></item><item><title>On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06382v5</link><description>This paper establishes a fundamental impossibility theorem: no LLM capable ofperforming non-trivial knowledge aggregation can simultaneously achievetruthful knowledge representation, semantic information conservation, completerevelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality. Theimpossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematicalstructure of information aggregation itself. We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction ofideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledgeto shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains:mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules(Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Expconvexity). In particular, we show how to quantify the creation ofoverconfident or intuitive responses-the signature of both hallucination andcreativity, or imagination. To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of thesemantic information measure and the emergence operator to model boundedreasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generatesaccessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, theidealized unconstrained reasoning strictly preserves semantic content. By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematicallyidentical phenomena-grounded in departures from truthfulness, semanticinformation conservation, revelation of relevant knowledge, andknowledge-constrained optimality-we offer a principled foundation for managingthese behaviors in advanced AI systems. Finally, we present some speculativeideas to inspire evaluation and refinements of the proposed theory.</description><author>Micha≈Ç P.

In this paper, we introduce Grounded-VideoLLM,a novel Video-LLM adept at perceiving and reasoning over specific video momentsin a fine-grained manner. We identify that current Video-LLMs have limitationsfor fine-grained video understanding since they lack effective temporalmodeling and timestamp representation. In light of this, we sharpen our modelby incorporating (1) an additional temporal stream to encode the relationshipsbetween frames and (2) discrete temporal tokens enriched with specific timeknowledge to represent timestamps. To optimize the training ofGrounded-VideoLLM, we employ a multi-stage training scheme, beginning withsimple video-captioning tasks and progressively introducing video temporalgrounding tasks of increasing complexity. To further enhanceGrounded-VideoLLM's temporal reasoning capability, we also curate a groundedVideoQA dataset by an automatic annotation pipeline. Extensive experimentsdemonstrate that Grounded-VideoLLM not only excels in fine-grained groundingtasks such as temporal sentence grounding, dense video captioning, and groundedVideoQA, but also shows great potential as a versatile video assistant forgeneral video understanding.</description><author>Haibo Wang, Zhiyang Xu, Yu Cheng, Shizhe Diao, Yufan Zhou, Yixin Cao, Qifan Wang, Weifeng Ge, Lifu Huang</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 05:15:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03290v2</guid></item><item><title>WangchanThaiInstruct: An instruction-following Dataset for Culture-Aware, Multitask, and Multi-domain Evaluation in Thai</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15239v1</link><description>Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but theirperformance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored.

However, due to the extendedtrajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLNperformance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overlydetailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, whichcould provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motionspace for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAVCollaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinctaltitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the trainingand evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired withtarget-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen mapsand an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model'sgeneralization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAVcollaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates amultimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while thelow-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation andtarget grounding.

However,existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real applicationchallenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. Toaddress this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensivebenchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasksthrough interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, RepositoryManagement, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and WebSearching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-basedevaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, staticevaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators thatautomatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA modelssuch as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibitsignificant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses asignificant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of inputtokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, itintroduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiaritywith the precise usage of the MCP servers.

The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes tomodel training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, manyof these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample'sinfluence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutivelearning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate thesample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences acrosssuccessive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, weapproximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating theneed for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being asecond-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable tothat of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achievedby computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficientlyapproximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess theapproximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Ourtheoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lowerapproximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensiveexperiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmarkdatasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coresetselection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scalevision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of datapoints and outperforms strong baselines.</description><author>Haoru Tan, Sitong Wu, Xiuzhe Wu, Wang Wang, Bo Zhao, Zeke Xie, Gui-Song Xia, Xiaojuan Qi</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 11:59:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14648v1</guid></item><item><title>STEM: Efficient Relative Capability Evaluation of LLMs through Structured Transition Samples</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12096v2</link><description>Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly challengingas model capabilities advance rapidly.

However, current approaches largely rely on predefinedthreat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to exposediverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, aframework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoningnovel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-ScenarioGeneration, where a large language model, grounded in structured drivingknowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that isboth plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is thenspecified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threatintroduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph toidentify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations aredesigned to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space andcreate critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiplereinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severecollision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, ourScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on differentsimulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenariosimproves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework throughreal-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generatedscenarios are both plausible and critical.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown greatpromise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relationclassification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a relatedentity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determinewhether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentencestructures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Suchhallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising theintegrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address thesechallenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-awaresEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into therelation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,DEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations foreach pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentenceinto a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noisewhile preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all localpredictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,correcting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce acausality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentanglingspurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learningwith human feedback.

Existing Turkish benchmarks often lackeither task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addressesthese gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generativetasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness ofTurkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, andquestion answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. Weevaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different modelfamilies and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centricinstruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual orgeneral-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored forthe language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correctionand extractive question answering are particularly discriminative indifferentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive andculturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development andassessment of LLMs in Turkish.</description><author>Yakup Abrek Er, Ilker Kesen, G√∂zde G√ºl ≈ûahin, Aykut Erdem</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 14:42:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16431v1</guid></item><item><title>Detecting and Characterizing Planning in Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18098v1</link><description>Modern large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performanceacross a wide range of multi-step reasoning tasks. Recent work suggests thatLLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance andgenerating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merelyimprovising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixedplanning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. Todistinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we presentformal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalizethem as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to bothbase and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generationbenchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previouslyshown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku,Gemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and onMBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks andeven successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuningrefines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating themfrom scratch. Together, these studies provide a reproducible and scalablefoundation for mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs.</description><author>Jatin Nainani, Sankaran Vaidyanathan, Connor Watts, Andre N.

Investigating the Use of LLMs as Judges</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18076v1</link><description>Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems remains a core challengeof natural language processing (NLP), further complicated by the rise of largelanguage models (LLMs) that aims to be general-purpose. Recently, largelanguage models as judges (LLJs) have emerged as a promising alternative totraditional metrics, but their validity remains underexplored. This positionpaper argues that the current enthusiasm around LLJs may be premature, as theiradoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of their reliability and validity asevaluators. Drawing on measurement theory from the social sciences, we identifyand critically assess four core assumptions underlying the use of LLJs: theirability to act as proxies for human judgment, their capabilities as evaluators,their scalability, and their cost-effectiveness. We examine how each of theseassumptions may be challenged by the inherent limitations of LLMs, LLJs, orcurrent practices in NLG evaluation. To ground our analysis, we explore threeapplications of LLJs: text summarization, data annotation, and safetyalignment. Finally, we highlight the need for more responsible evaluationpractices in LLJs evaluation, to ensure that their growing role in the fieldsupports, rather than undermines, progress in NLG.</description><author>Khaoula Chehbouni, Mohammed Haddou, Jackie Chi Kit Cheung, Golnoosh Farnadi</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 14:43:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18076v1</guid></item><item><title>A holistic perception system of internal and external monitoring for ground autonomous vehicles: AutoTRUST paradigm</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17969v1</link><description>This paper introduces a holistic perception system for internal and externalmonitoring of autonomous vehicles, with the aim of demonstrating a novelAI-leveraged self-adaptive framework of advanced vehicle technologies andsolutions that optimize perception and experience on-board. Internal monitoringsystem relies on a multi-camera setup designed for predicting and identifyingdriver and occupant behavior through facial recognition, exploiting in additiona large language model as virtual assistant. Moreover, the in-cabin monitoringsystem includes AI-empowered smart sensors that measure air-quality and performthermal comfort analysis for efficient on and off-boarding. On the other hand,external monitoring system perceives the surrounding environment of vehicle,through a LiDAR-based cost-efficient semantic segmentation approach, thatperforms highly accurate and efficient super-resolution on low-quality raw 3Dpoint clouds. The holistic perception framework is developed in the context ofEU's Horizon Europe programm AutoTRUST, and has been integrated and deployed ona real electric vehicle provided by ALKE. Experimental validation andevaluation at the integration site of Joint Research Centre at Ispra, Italy,highlights increased performance and efficiency of the modular blocks of theproposed perception architecture.</description><author>Alexandros Gkillas, Christos Anagnostopoulos, Nikos Piperigkos, Dimitris Tsiktsiris, Theofilos Christodoulou, Theofanis Siamatras, Dimitrios Triantafyllou, Christos Basdekis, Theoktisti Marinopoulou, Panagiotis Lepentsiotis, Elefterios Blitsis, Aggeliki Zacharaki, Nearchos Stylianidis, Leonidas Katelaris, Lamberto Salvan, Aris S.
