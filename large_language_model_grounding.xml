Inthis paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. Toachieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMsand demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our methodinvolves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guidethe MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models toindependently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model'soutput. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inferenceprocess in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance ofeach reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade offobject precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by givingcontrol over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user tocontrol the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree ofvisual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucinationbenchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLMinference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigationmethods.</description><author>Oscar Mañas, Pierluca D'Oro, Koustuv Sinha, Adriana Romero-Soriano, Michal Drozdzal, Aishwarya Agrawal</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 17:29:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11616v1</guid></item><item><title>Reinforcing Video Reasoning Segmentation to Think Before It Segments</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11538v1</link><description>Video reasoning segmentation (VRS) endeavors to delineate referred objects invideos guided by implicit instructions that encapsulate human intent andtemporal logic. Previous approaches leverage large vision language models(LVLMs) to encode object semantics into &lt;SEG&gt; tokens for mask prediction.However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inferenceand suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawinginspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduceVeason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning insegmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, wecurate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoningtrajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding,yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPOfine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space byoptimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic rewardmechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporalconsistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding.Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achievesstate-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art bysignificant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &amp;F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &amp;F in ReasonVOS),while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R). Our code and modelweights will be available at Veason-R1.</description><author>Sitong Gong, Lu Zhang, Yunzhi Zhuge, Xu Jia, Pingping Zhang, Huchuan Lu</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 15:34:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11538v1</guid></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Perspective on Explainable AI across the Machine Learning Workflow</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11529v1</link><description>Artificial intelligence is reshaping science and industry, yet many usersstill regard its models as opaque "black boxes". Conventional explainableartificial-intelligence methods clarify individual predictions but overlook theupstream decisions and downstream quality checks that determine whetherinsights can be trusted. In this work, we present Holistic ExplainableArtificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embedsexplanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors thoseexplanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up,learning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into asingle taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts,data analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs;our survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded intheories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction andfindings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics thatmake explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable. A comprehensivetaxonomy operationalises these insights, reducing terminological ambiguity andenabling rigorous coverage analysis of existing toolchains. We furtherdemonstrate how AI agents that embed large-language models can orchestratediverse explanation techniques, translating technical artifacts intostakeholder-specific narratives that bridge the gap between AI developers anddomain experts. Departing from traditional surveys or perspective articles,this work melds concepts from multiple disciplines, lessons from real-worldprojects and a critical synthesis of the literature to advance a novel,end-to-end viewpoint on transparency, trustworthiness and responsible AIdeployment.</description><author>George Paterakis, Andrea Castellani, George Papoutsoglou, Tobias Rodemann, Ioannis Tsamardinos</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 15:15:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11529v1</guid></item><item><title>UI-Venus Technical Report: Building High-performance UI Agents with RFT</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10833v2</link><description>We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as inputbased on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performanceon both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousandhigh-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based onQwen2.5-VL. Specifically, the 7B and 72B variants of UI-Venus obtain 94.1% /50.8% and 95.3% / 61.9% on the standard grounding benchmarks, i.e.,Screenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines includingopen-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5. To show UI-Venus's summary andplaning ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UInavigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9%success rate, also beating existing models. To achieve this, we introducecarefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasksand corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.

In this report, we share our key findings in the development of thereasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable visionfoundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training,which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then proposeReinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the fullpotential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement acrossa diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding,content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long documentinterpretation. In a comprehensive evaluation across 42 public benchmarks,GLM-4.5V achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks amongopen-source models of similar size, and demonstrates competitive or evensuperior results compared to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash onchallenging tasks including Coding and GUI Agents. Meanwhile, the smallerGLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking remains highly competitive-achieving superior results tothe much larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B on 29 benchmarks.

Existing methodsfor MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensivefine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. Inthis paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modalChain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential ofunified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structurepersonalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1)grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-providedimages and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditionedon both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To furtherenhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal PolicyOptimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstratethat MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs togenerate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in azero-shot manner.</description><author>Qian Liang, Yujia Wu, Kuncheng Li, Jiwei Wei, Shiyuan He, Jinyu Guo, Ning Xie</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 12:20:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11433v1</guid></item><item><title>MCA-Bench: A Multimodal Benchmark for Evaluating CAPTCHA Robustness Against VLM-based Attacks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05982v4</link><description>As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a criticaldefense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemesencompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text andobfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-basedquestions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodalbenchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address thisgap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarkingsuite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluationprotocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tunespecialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent,cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bencheffectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs undervaried attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis ofhow challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate.Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles andidentify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHAhardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration.

However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes,large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of languagereferences. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of naturallanguage training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learnfrom little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address thesechallenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributesfrom 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with theability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning.Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and canbe applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achievesstate-of-the-art zero-shot performance on complex view-dependent groundingtasks on two benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on twoautonomous vehicles and demonstrate that our approach can be used forobject-goal navigation on previously unseen real-world environments.

However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly duringthe iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusionalleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, thoughat the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such asRetrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioningdenoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. Whileeffective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage andretrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP forsimilarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the PrototypeDiffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directlyinto the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning -without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDMconstructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image featuresusing contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps byaligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns,enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments showthat PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational andstorage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-basedconditioning in diffusion models.</description><author>Bilal Faye, Hanane Azzag, Mustapha Lebbah</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 21:24:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09922v2</guid></item><item><title>Approaching the Source of Symbol Grounding with Confluent Reductions of Abstract Meaning Representation Directed Graphs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11068v1</link><description>Abstract meaning representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism used torepresent the meaning of sentences as directed acyclic graphs.

This makes it difficult todistinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawedreasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visualUnderstanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating thecross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models(AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions acrosssix challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempoand AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skillprofiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. Thisforces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio andvideo, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. Toassess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addressesthe lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposesreasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning isgrounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validityof each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a criticalreasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks),their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. Thisdiscrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers throughflawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way formore robust multimodal evaluation.</description><author>Siminfar Samakoush Galougah, Rishie Raj, Sanjoy Chowdhury, Sayan Nag, Ramani Duraiswami</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:39:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07470v2</guid></item><item><title>CUS-QA: Local-Knowledge-Oriented Open-Ended Question Answering Dataset</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22752v2</link><description>We introduce CUS-QA, a benchmark for open-ended regional question answeringthat encompasses both textual and visual modalities.
