In this study,we propose Grounded 3D-LLM, which explores the potential of 3D largemulti-modal models (3D LMMs) to consolidate various 3D vision tasks within aunified generative framework. The model uses scene referent tokens as specialnoun phrases to reference 3D scenes, enabling it to handle sequences thatinterleave 3D and textual data. Per-task instruction-following templates areemployed to ensure natural and diversity in translating 3D vision tasks intolanguage formats. To facilitate the use of referent tokens in subsequentlanguage modeling, we provide a large-scale, automatically curated groundedscene-text dataset with over 1 million phrase-to-region correspondences andintroduce Contrastive Language-Scene Pre-training (CLASP) to performphrase-level scene-text alignment using this data. Our comprehensive evaluationcovers open-ended tasks like dense captioning and 3D question answering,alongside close-ended tasks such as object detection and language grounding.Experiments across multiple 3D benchmarks reveal the leading performance andthe broad applicability of Grounded 3D-LLM.

Inthis work, we show that such a corresponding region pair can be predicted bythe same language prompt on two different images using the pre-trained largemultimodal models based on GroundingDINO and SAM. This enables a fullyautomated and training-free registration algorithm, potentially generalisableto a wide range of image registration tasks. In this paper, we presentexperimental results using one of the challenging tasks, registeringinter-subject prostate MR images, which involves both highly variable intensityand morphology between patients. Tell2Reg is training-free, eliminating theneed for costly and time-consuming data curation and labelling that waspreviously required for this registration task. This approach outperformsunsupervised learning-based registration methods tested, and has a performancecomparable to weakly-supervised methods. Additional qualitative results arealso presented to suggest that, for the first time, there is a potentialcorrelation between language semantics and spatial correspondence, includingthe spatial invariance in language-prompted regions and the difference inlanguage prompts between the obtained local and global correspondences.

While small models are computationallyefficient, their capacity is much limited compared with large models. To breakthis trade-off, this paper builds a small emotional vision language model(SEVLM) by emotion modeling and input-output feature alignment. On the onehand, based on valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) knowledge annotated bypsychology experts, we introduce and fuse emotional features derived throughVAD dictionary and a VAD head to align VAD vectors of predicted emotionexplanation and the ground truth. This allows the vision language model tobetter understand and generate emotional texts, compared with using traditionaltext embeddings alone. On the other hand, we design a contrastive head to pullclose embeddings of the image, its emotion class, and explanation, which alignsmodel outputs and inputs. On two public affective explanation datasets, we showthat the proposed techniques consistently improve the visual art understandingperformance of baseline SEVLMs. Importantly, the proposed model can be trainedand evaluated on a single RTX 2080 Ti while exhibiting very strong performance:it not only outperforms the state-of-the-art small models but is alsocompetitive compared with LLaVA 7B after fine-tuning and GPT4(V).

A common practice is to label data via consensus annotationover human judgments. However, annotators' judgments for subjective tasks candiffer in many ways: they may reflect different qualitative judgments about anexample, and they may be mapped to a labeling scheme in different ways. We showthat these nuances can be captured by natural language explanations, andpropose a method to rescale ordinal annotations and explanations using LLMs.Specifically, we feed annotators' Likert ratings and corresponding explanationsinto an LLM and prompt it to produce a numeric score anchored in a scoringrubric. These scores should reflect the annotators' underlying assessments ofthe example. The rubric can be designed or modified after annotation, andinclude distinctions that may not have been known when the original errortaxonomy was devised. We explore our technique in the context of rating systemoutputs for a document-grounded question answering task, where LLMs achievenear-human performance. Our method rescales the raw judgments without impactingagreement and brings the scores closer to human judgments grounded in the samescoring rubric.</description><author>Manya Wadhwa, Jifan Chen, Junyi Jessy Li, Greg Durrett</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 14:47:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14770v4</guid></item><item><title>Beyond Aesthetics: Cultural Competence in Text-to-Image Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06863v2</link><description>Text-to-Image (T2I) models are being increasingly adopted in diverse globalcommunities where they create visual representations of their unique cultures.Current T2I benchmarks primarily focus on faithfulness, aesthetics, and realismof generated images, overlooking the critical dimension of cultural competence.In this work, we introduce a framework to evaluate cultural competence of T2Imodels along two crucial dimensions: cultural awareness and cultural diversity,and present a scalable approach using a combination of structured knowledgebases and large language models to build a large dataset of cultural artifactsto enable this evaluation. In particular, we apply this approach to build CUBE(CUltural BEnchmark for Text-to-Image models), a first-of-its-kind benchmark toevaluate cultural competence of T2I models. CUBE covers cultural artifactsassociated with 8 countries across different geo-cultural regions and along 3concepts: cuisine, landmarks, and art. CUBE consists of 1) CUBE-1K, a set ofhigh-quality prompts that enable the evaluation of cultural awareness, and 2)CUBE-CSpace, a larger dataset of cultural artifacts that serves as grounding toevaluate cultural diversity. We also introduce cultural diversity as a novelT2I evaluation component, leveraging quality-weighted Vendi score. Ourevaluations reveal significant gaps in the cultural awareness of existingmodels across countries and provide valuable insights into the culturaldiversity of T2I outputs for under-specified prompts. Our methodology isextendable to other cultural regions and concepts, and can facilitate thedevelopment of T2I models that better cater to the global population.</description><author>Nithish Kannen, Arif Ahmad, Marco Andreetto, Vinodkumar Prabhakaran, Utsav Prabhu, Adji Bousso Dieng, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Shachi Dave</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 17:57:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06863v2</guid></item><item><title>Robotic Control via Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08693v1</link><description>A key limitation of learned robot control policies is their inability togeneralize outside their training data. Recent works on vision-language-actionmodels (VLAs) have shown that the use of large, internet pre-trainedvision-language models as the backbone of learned robot policies cansubstantially improve their robustness and generalization ability. Yet, one ofthe most exciting capabilities of large vision-language models in other domainsis their ability to reason iteratively through complex problems. Can that samecapability be brought into robotics to allow policies to improve performance byreasoning about a given task before acting? Naive use of "chain-of-thought"(CoT) style prompting is significantly less effective with standard VLAsbecause of the relatively simple training examples that are available to them.Additionally, purely semantic reasoning about sub-tasks, as is common inregular CoT, is insufficient for robot policies that need to ground theirreasoning in sensory observations and the robot state. To this end, weintroduce Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (ECoT) for VLAs, in which wetrain VLAs to perform multiple steps of reasoning about plans, sub-tasks,motions, and visually grounded features like object bounding boxes and endeffector positions, before predicting the robot action. We design a scalablepipeline for generating synthetic training data for ECoT on large robotdatasets. We demonstrate, that ECoT increases the absolute success rate ofOpenVLA, the current strongest open-source VLA policy, by 28% acrosschallenging generalization tasks, without any additional robot training data.Additionally, ECoT makes it easier for humans to interpret a policy's failuresand correct its behavior using natural language.</description><author>Zawalski Michał, Chen William, Pertsch Karl, Mees Oier, Finn Chelsea, Levine Sergey</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 17:31:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08693v1</guid></item><item><title>Stepwise Verification and Remediation of Student Reasoning Errors with Large Language Model Tutors</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09136v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to scale high-qualitypersonalized education to all. A promising approach towards this means is tobuild dialog tutoring models that scaffold students' problem-solving. However,even though existing LLMs perform well in solving reasoning questions, theystruggle to precisely detect student's errors and tailor their feedback tothese errors. Inspired by real-world teaching practice where teachers identifystudent errors and customize their response based on them, we focus onverifying student solutions and show how grounding to such verificationimproves the overall quality of tutor response generation. We collect a datasetof 1K stepwise math reasoning chains with the first error step annotated byteachers. We show empirically that finding the mistake in a student solution ischallenging for current models. We propose and evaluate several verifiers fordetecting these errors. Using both automatic and human evaluation we show thatthe student solution verifiers steer the generation model towards highlytargeted responses to student errors which are more often correct with lesshallucinations compared to existing baselines.</description><author>Nico Daheim, Jakub Macina, Manu Kapur, Iryna Gurevych, Mrinmaya Sachan</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 10:11:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09136v1</guid></item><item><title>3D Feature Distillation with Object-Centric Priors</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18742v3</link><description>Grounding natural language to the physical world is a ubiquitous topic with awide range of applications in computer vision and robotics. Recently, 2Dvision-language models such as CLIP have been widely popularized, due to theirimpressive capabilities for open-vocabulary grounding in 2D images. Recentworks aim to elevate 2D CLIP features to 3D via feature distillation, buteither learn neural fields that are scene-specific and hence lackgeneralization, or focus on indoor room scan data that require access tomultiple camera views, which is not practical in robot manipulation scenarios.Additionally, related methods typically fuse features at pixel-level and assumethat all camera views are equally informative. In this work, we show that thisapproach leads to sub-optimal 3D features, both in terms of grounding accuracy,as well as segmentation crispness. To alleviate this, we propose a multi-viewfeature fusion strategy that employs object-centric priors to eliminateuninformative views based on semantic information, and fuse features atobject-level via instance segmentation masks. To distill our object-centric 3Dfeatures, we generate a large-scale synthetic multi-view dataset of clutteredtabletop scenes, spawning 15k scenes from over 3300 unique object instances,which we make publicly available. We show that our method reconstructs 3D CLIPfeatures with improved grounding capacity and spatial consistency, while doingso from single-view RGB-D, thus departing from the assumption of multiplecamera views at test time. Finally, we show that our approach can generalize tonovel tabletop domains and be re-purposed for 3D instance segmentation withoutfine-tuning, and demonstrate its utility for language-guided robotic graspingin clutter</description><author>Georgios Tziafas, Yucheng Xu, Zhibin Li, Hamidreza Kasaei</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 14:23:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18742v3</guid></item><item><title>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14608v6</link><description>Large models represent a groundbreaking advancement in multiple applicationfields, enabling remarkable achievements across various tasks. However, theirunprecedented scale comes with significant computational costs. These models,often consisting of billions of parameters, require vast amounts ofcomputational resources for execution. Especially, the expansive scale andcomputational demands pose considerable challenges when customizing them forparticular downstream tasks, particularly over the hardware platformsconstrained by computational capabilities. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) provides a practical solution by efficiently adjusting the large modelsover the various downstream tasks. In particular, PEFT refers to the process ofadjusting the parameters of a pre-trained large models to adapt it to aspecific task or domain while minimizing the number of additional parametersintroduced or computational resources required. This approach is particularlyimportant when dealing with large-scale language models with high parametercounts, as fine-tuning these models from scratch can be computationallyexpensive and resource-intensive, posing considerable challenges in thesupporting system platform design. In this survey, we present comprehensivestudies of various PEFT algorithms, examining their performance andcomputational overhead. Moreover, we provide an overview of applicationsdeveloped using different PEFT algorithms and discuss common techniquesemployed to mitigate computation costs for PEFT. In addition to providing anextensive survey from an algorithmic standpoint, we also examine variousreal-world system designs to investigate the implementation costs associatedwith different PEFT approaches.

Toimprove upon this status quo, this paper introduces ASTrust, aninterpretability method for LLMs of code that generates explanations groundedin the relationship between model confidence and syntactic structures ofprogramming languages. ASTrust explains generated code in the context of syntaxcategories based on Abstract Syntax Trees and aids practitioners inunderstanding model predictions at both local (individual code snippets) andglobal (larger datasets of code) levels. By distributing and assigning modelconfidence scores to well-known syntactic structures that exist within ASTs,our approach moves beyond prior techniques that perform token-level confidencemapping by offering a view of model confidence that directly aligns withprogramming language concepts with which developers are familiar. To putASTrust into practice, we developed an automated visualization that illustratesthe aggregated model confidence scores superimposed on sequence, heat-map, andgraph-based visuals of syntactic structures from ASTs. We examine both thepractical benefit that ASTrust can provide through a data science study on 12popular LLMs on a curated set of GitHub repos and the usefulness of ASTrustthrough a human study.</description><author>David N.

This process theoretically learns a joint distribution ofitem and model response, with item difficulty and value conformity as latentvariables, where the generator co-evolves with the LLM, addressingchronoeffect.

Medicine's inherently multimodal nature incorporating scans andtext-based medical histories to write reports makes it conducive to benefitfrom these leaps in AI capabilities. We evaluate the publicly available, stateof the art, foundational vision-language models for chest X-ray interpretationacross several datasets and benchmarks. We use linear probes to evaluate theperformance of various components including CheXagent's vision transformer andQ-former, which outperform the industry-standard Torch X-ray Vision modelsacross many different datasets showing robust generalisation capabilities.Importantly, we find that vision-language models often hallucinate withconfident language, which slows down clinical interpretation.

The compositionalnature of natural language enables the localization beyond predefined events,posing a certain challenge to the compositional generalizability of existingmethods. Recent studies establish the correspondence between videos and queriesthrough a decompose-reconstruct manner to achieve compositional generalization.However, they only consider dominant primitives and build negative queriesthrough random sampling and recombination, resulting in semanticallyimplausible negatives that hinder the models from learning rationalcompositions. In addition, recent DETR-based methods still underperform incompositional temporal grounding, showing irrational saliency responses whengiven negative queries that have subtle differences from positive queries. Toaddress these limitations, we first propose a large language model-drivenmethod for negative query construction, utilizing GPT-3.5-Turbo to generatesemantically plausible hard negative queries. Subsequently, we introduce acoarse-to-fine saliency ranking strategy, which encourages the model to learnthe multi-granularity semantic relationships between videos and hierarchicalnegative queries to boost compositional generalization.

An open-worldgrasping system should be able to combine high-level contextual with low-levelphysical-geometric reasoning in order to be applicable in arbitrary scenarios.Recent works exploit the web-scale knowledge inherent in large language models(LLMs) to plan and reason in robotic context, but rely on external vision andaction models to ground such knowledge into the environment and parameterizeactuation. This setup suffers from two major bottlenecks: a) the LLM'sreasoning capacity is constrained by the quality of visual grounding, and b)LLMs do not contain low-level spatial understanding of the world, which isessential for grasping in contact-rich scenarios. In this work we demonstratethat modern vision-language models (VLMs) are capable of tackling suchlimitations, as they are implicitly grounded and can jointly reason aboutsemantics and geometry. We propose OWG, an open-world grasping pipeline thatcombines VLMs with segmentation and grasp synthesis models to unlock groundedworld understanding in three stages: open-ended referring segmentation,grounded grasp planning and grasp ranking via contact reasoning, all of whichcan be applied zero-shot via suitable visual prompting mechanisms.

Thesefindings underscore the potential of LLMs as powerful aids in biomedicalhypothesis generation and provide valuable insights to guide further researchin this area.</description><author>Biqing Qi, Kaiyan Zhang, Kai Tian, Haoxiang Li, Zhang-Ren Chen, Sihang Zeng, Ermo Hua, Hu Jinfang, Bowen Zhou</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 06:27:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08940v2</guid></item><item><title>By My Eyes: Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models with Sensor Data via Visual Prompting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10385v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities acrossvarious domains.

Wesimultaneously consider both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, where theformer comes from the lack of knowledge about the ground truth (such as aboutfacts or the language), and the latter comes from irreducible randomness (suchas multiple possible answers). In particular, we derive aninformation-theoretic metric that allows to reliably detect when only epistemicuncertainty is large, in which case the output of the model is unreliable. Thiscondition can be computed based solely on the output of the model obtainedsimply by some special iterative prompting based on the previous responses.Such quantification, for instance, allows to detect hallucinations (cases whenepistemic uncertainty is high) in both single- and multi-answer responses. Thisis in contrast to many standard uncertainty quantification strategies (such asthresholding the log-likelihood of a response) where hallucinations in themulti-answer case cannot be detected. We conduct a series of experiments whichdemonstrate the advantage of our formulation. Further, our investigations shedsome light on how the probabilities assigned to a given output by an LLM can beamplified by iterative prompting, which might be of independent interest.</description><author>Yasin Abbasi Yadkori, Ilja Kuzborskij, András György, Csaba Szepesvári</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2024 15:55:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02543v2</guid></item><item><title>Instruction-Driven Game Engines on Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00276v3</link><description>The Instruction-Driven Game Engine (IDGE) project aims to democratize gamedevelopment by enabling a large language model (LLM) to follow free-form gamerules and autonomously generate game-play processes.

Current agent frameworks often suffer fromdependencies on single-agent execution and lack robust inter-modulecommunication, frequently leading to suboptimal multi-agent reinforcementlearning (MARL) policies and inadequate task coordination. To address thesechallenges, we present a framework for training large language models (LLMs) ascollaborative agents to enable coordinated behaviors in cooperative MARL. Eachagent maintains a private intention consisting of its current goal andassociated sub-tasks. Agents broadcast their intentions periodically, allowingother agents to infer coordination tasks. A propagation network transformsbroadcast intentions into teammate-specific communication messages, sharingrelevant goals with designated teammates. The architecture of our framework isstructured into planning, grounding, and execution modules. During execution,multiple agents interact in a downstream environment and communicate intentionsto enable coordinated behaviors. The grounding module dynamically adaptscomprehension strategies based on emerging coordination patterns, whilefeedback from execution agents influnces the planning module, enabling thedynamic re-planning of sub-tasks. Results in collaborative environmentsimulation demonstrate intention propagation reduces miscoordination errors byaligning sub-task dependencies between agents. Agents learn when to communicateintentions and which teammates require task details, resulting in emergentcoordinated behaviors. This demonstrates the efficacy of intention sharing forcooperative multi-agent RL based on LLMs.</description><author>Xihe Qiu, Haoyu Wang, Xiaoyu Tan, Chao Qu, Yujie Xiong, Yuan Cheng, Yinghui Xu, Wei Chu, Yuan Qi</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2024 13:14:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12532v1</guid></item><item><title>Hierarchical Indexing for Retrieval-Augmented Opinion Summarization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00435v2</link><description>We propose a method for unsupervised abstractive opinion summarization, thatcombines the attributability and scalability of extractive approaches with thecoherence and fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Addressing this, the development ofpersonality traits in LLMs emerges as a crucial area of research to unlocktheir latent potential. Existing methods to personify LLMs generally involvestrategies like employing stylized training data for instruction tuning orusing prompt engineering to simulate different personalities. These methodsonly capture superficial linguistic styles instead of the core of personalitiesand are therefore not stable.

Weincorporate personality traits directly into the model parameters, enhancingthe model's resistance to induction, promoting consistency, and supporting thedynamic evolution of personality. Single-agent evaluation validates ourmethod's superiority, as it produces responses more aligned with referencepersonalities compared to other approaches.

While these models have shown unprecedented performance in manydownstream zero-shot tasks (eg image captioning, question answers, etc), stilllittle emphasis has been put on transferring one of the core LLM capability ofIn-Context Learning (ICL). ICL is the ability of a model to reason about adownstream task with a few examples demonstrations embedded in the prompt. Inthis work, through extensive evaluations, we find that the state-of-the-artVLMs somewhat lack the ability to follow ICL instructions. In particular, wediscover that even models that underwent large-scale mixed modalitypre-training and were implicitly guided to make use of interleaved image andtext information (intended to consume helpful context from multiple images)under-perform when prompted with few-shot demonstrations (in an ICL way),likely due to their lack of direct ICL instruction tuning.

Recent advances on large language models (LLMs)have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMscould help with misinformation detection remains relatively underexplored. Mostof existing state-of-the-art approaches either do not consider evidence andsolely focus on claim related features or assume the evidence to be provided.Few approaches consider evidence retrieval as part of the misinformationdetection but rely on fine-tuning models.

Unlike existingsolutions that typically involve costly supplementary training data or theintegration of external knowledge sources, DOPRA innovatively addresseshallucinations by decoding specific weighted layer penalties andredistribution, offering an economical and effective solution withoutadditional resources. DOPRA is grounded in unique insights into the intrinsicmechanisms controlling hallucinations within MLLMs, especially the models'tendency to over-rely on a subset of summary tokens in the self-attentionmatrix, neglecting critical image-related information. This phenomenon isparticularly pronounced in certain strata. To counteract this over-reliance,DOPRA employs a strategy of weighted overlay penalties and redistribution inspecific layers, such as the 12th layer, during the decoding process.Furthermore, DOPRA includes a retrospective allocation process that re-examinesthe sequence of generated tokens, allowing the algorithm to reallocate tokenselection to better align with the actual image content, thereby reducing theincidence of hallucinatory descriptions in auto-generated captions.

However, the intricate and irregular nature of clinical dataassociated with acute stroke, particularly blood pressure (BP) measurements,presents substantial obstacles to effective visual analytics anddecision-making. Through a year-long collaboration with experiencedneurologists, we developed PhenoFlow, a visual analytics system that leveragesthe collaboration between human and Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze theextensive and complex data of acute ischemic stroke patients. PhenoFlowpioneers an innovative workflow, where the LLM serves as a data wrangler whileneurologists explore and supervise the output using visualizations and naturallanguage interactions. This approach enables neurologists to focus more ondecision-making with reduced cognitive load. To protect sensitive patientinformation, PhenoFlow only utilizes metadata to make inferences and synthesizeexecutable codes, without accessing raw patient data. This ensures that theresults are both reproducible and interpretable while maintaining patientprivacy. The system incorporates a slice-and-wrap design that employs temporalfolding to create an overlaid circular visualization.

Recent works attempt to complete KGs in atext-generation manner with large language models (LLMs). However, they need toground the output of LLMs to KG entities, which inevitably brings errors. Inthis paper, we present a finetuning framework, DIFT, aiming to unleash the KGcompletion ability of LLMs and avoid grounding errors. Given an incompletefact, DIFT employs a lightweight model to obtain candidate entities andfinetunes an LLM with discrimination instructions to select the correct onefrom the given candidates. To improve performance while reducing instructiondata, DIFT uses a truncated sampling method to select useful facts forfinetuning and injects KG embeddings into the LLM. Extensive experiments onbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</description><author>Yang Liu, Xiaobin Tian, Zequn Sun, Wei Hu</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 02:25:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16127v1</guid></item><item><title>Tree-Planner: Efficient Close-loop Task Planning with Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08582v2</link><description>This paper studies close-loop task planning, which refers to the process ofgenerating a sequence of skills (a plan) to accomplish a specific goal whileadapting the plan based on real-time observations. Recently, prompting LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) to generate actions iteratively has become a prevalentparadigm due to its superior performance and user-friendliness. However, thisparadigm is plagued by two inefficiencies: high token consumption and redundanterror correction, both of which hinder its scalability for large-scale testingand applications. To address these issues, we propose Tree-Planner, whichreframes task planning with LLMs into three distinct phases: plan sampling,action tree construction, and grounded deciding. Tree-Planner starts by usingan LLM to sample a set of potential plans before execution, followed by theaggregation of them to form an action tree. Finally, the LLM performs atop-down decision-making process on the tree, taking into account real-timeenvironmental information. Experiments show that Tree-Planner achievesstate-of-the-art performance while maintaining high efficiency. By decomposingLLM queries into a single plan-sampling call and multiple grounded-decidingcalls, a considerable part of the prompt are less likely to be repeatedlyconsumed. As a result, token consumption is reduced by 92.2% compared to thepreviously best-performing model. Additionally, by enabling backtracking on theaction tree as needed, the correction process becomes more flexible, leading toa 40.5% decrease in error corrections.</description><author>Mengkang Hu, Yao Mu, Xinmiao Yu, Mingyu Ding, Shiguang Wu, Wenqi Shao, Qiguang Chen, Bin Wang, Yu Qiao, Ping Luo</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 12:25:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08582v2</guid></item><item><title>The Geometry of Queries: Query-Based Innovations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18044v1</link><description>Digital health chatbots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have thepotential to significantly improve personal health management for chronicconditions by providing accessible and on-demand health coaching andquestion-answering. However, these chatbots risk providing unverified andinaccurate information because LLMs generate responses based on patternslearned from diverse internet data. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) canhelp mitigate hallucinations and inaccuracies in LLM responses by grounding iton reliable content. However, efficiently and accurately retrieving mostrelevant set of content for real-time user questions remains a challenge. Inthis work, we introduce Query-Based Retrieval Augmented Generation (QB-RAG), anovel approach that pre-computes a database of potential queries from a contentbase using LLMs. For an incoming patient question, QB-RAG efficiently matchesit against this pre-generated query database using vector search, improvingalignment between user questions and the content. We establish a theoreticalfoundation for QB-RAG and provide a comparative analysis of existing retrievalenhancement techniques for RAG systems.

Existing approaches typically rely on the robustgeneralization capabilities of multimodal pretrained models, computingsimilarities between manually crafted textual features representing "normal" or"abnormal" semantics and image features to detect anomalies and localizeanomalous patches. However, the generic descriptions of "abnormal" often failto precisely match diverse types of anomalies across different objectcategories. Additionally, computing feature similarities for single patchesstruggles to pinpoint specific locations of anomalies with various sizes andscales. To address these issues, we propose a novel ZSAD method called FiLo,comprising two components: adaptively learned Fine-Grained Description (FG-Des)and position-enhanced High-Quality Localization (HQ-Loc). FG-Des introducesfine-grained anomaly descriptions for each category using Large Language Models(LLMs) and employs adaptively learned textual templates to enhance the accuracyand interpretability of anomaly detection. HQ-Loc, utilizing Grounding DINO forpreliminary localization, position-enhanced text prompts, and Multi-scaleMulti-shape Cross-modal Interaction (MMCI) module, facilitates more accuratelocalization of anomalies of different sizes and shapes. Experimental resultson datasets like MVTec and VisA demonstrate that FiLo significantly improvesthe performance of ZSAD in both detection and localization, achievingstate-of-the-art performance with an image-level AUC of 83.9% and a pixel-levelAUC of 95.9% on the VisA dataset.

Addressing this, the development ofpersonality traits in LLMs emerges as a crucial area of research to unlocktheir latent potential. Existing methods to personify LLMs generally involvestrategies like employing stylized training data for instruction tuning orusing prompt engineering to simulate different personalities. These methodsonly capture superficial linguistic styles instead of the core of personalitiesand are therefore not stable. In this study, we propose PersLLM, integratingpsychology-grounded principles of personality: social practice, consistency,and dynamic development, into a comprehensive training methodology. Weincorporate personality traits directly into the model parameters, enhancingthe model's resistance to induction, promoting consistency, and supporting thedynamic evolution of personality. Single-agent evaluation validates ourmethod's superiority, as it produces responses more aligned with referencepersonalities compared to other approaches. Case studies for multi-agentcommunication highlight its benefits in enhancing opinion consistency withinindividual agents and fostering collaborative creativity among multiple agentsin dialogue contexts, potentially benefiting human simulation and multi-agentcooperation.

Inanticipation of this, we ask: can weaker models assess the correctness ofstronger models? We investigate this question in an analogous setting, wherestronger models (experts) possess the necessary information to answer questionsand weaker models (non-experts) lack this information. The method we evaluateis debate, where two LLM experts each argue for a different answer, and anon-expert selects the answer. We find that debate consistently helps bothnon-expert models and humans answer questions, achieving 76% and 88% accuracyrespectively (naive baselines obtain 48% and 60%). Furthermore, optimisingexpert debaters for persuasiveness in an unsupervised manner improvesnon-expert ability to identify the truth in debates.

This paradigm has demonstrated considerablebenefits and potential, particularly in representation and generalizationcapabilities, within the context of large language models. However, it facessignificant challenges in E-commerce search scenarios, including the complexityof generating detailed item titles from brief queries, the presence of noise initem titles with weak language order, issues with long-tail queries, and theinterpretability of results. To address these challenges, we have developed aninnovative framework for E-commerce search, called generative retrieval withpreference optimization. This framework is designed to effectively learn andalign an autoregressive model with target data, subsequently generating thefinal item through constraint-based beam search. By employing multi-spanidentifiers to represent raw item titles and transforming the task ofgenerating titles from queries into the task of generating multi-spanidentifiers from queries, we aim to simplify the generation process. Theframework further aligns with human preferences using click data and employs aconstrained search method to identify key spans for retrieving the final item,thereby enhancing result interpretability.

In this regard, studies on WSSGG have utilized imagecaptions to obtain unlocalized triplets while primarily focusing on groundingthe unlocalized triplets over image regions. However, they have overlooked thetwo issues involved in the triplet formation process from the captions: 1)Semantic over-simplification issue arises when extracting triplets fromcaptions, where fine-grained predicates in captions are undesirably convertedinto coarse-grained predicates, resulting in a long-tailed predicatedistribution, and 2) Low-density scene graph issue arises when aligning thetriplets in the caption with entity/predicate classes of interest, where manytriplets are discarded and not used in training, leading to insufficientsupervision. To tackle the two issues, we propose a new approach, i.e., LargeLanguage Model for weakly-supervised SGG (LLM4SGG), where we mitigate the twoissues by leveraging the LLM's in-depth understanding of language and reasoningability during the extraction of triplets from captions and alignment ofentity/predicate classes with target data. To further engage the LLM in theseprocesses, we adopt the idea of Chain-of-Thought and the in-context few-shotlearning strategy. To validate the effectiveness of LLM4SGG, we conductextensive experiments on Visual Genome and GQA datasets, showing significantimprovements in both Recall@K and mean Recall@K compared to thestate-of-the-art WSSGG methods.

There is a growing interest in AI for IT Operations (AIOps) whichaims to automate complex operational tasks, like fault localization and rootcause analysis, thereby reducing human intervention and customer impact.However, achieving the vision of autonomous and self-healing clouds throughAIOps is hampered by the lack of standardized frameworks for building,evaluating, and improving AIOps agents. This vision paper lays the groundworkfor such a framework by first framing the requirements and then discussingdesign decisions that satisfy them. We also propose AIOpsLab, a prototypeimplementation leveraging agent-cloud-interface that orchestrates anapplication, injects real-time faults using chaos engineering, and interfaceswith an agent to localize and resolve the faults. We report promising resultsand lay the groundwork to build a modular and robust framework for building,evaluating, and improving agents for autonomous clouds.</description><author>Manish Shetty, Yinfang Chen, Gagan Somashekar, Minghua Ma, Yogesh Simmhan, Xuchao Zhang, Jonathan Mace, Dax Vandevoorde, Pedro Las-Casas, Shachee Mishra Gupta, Suman Nath, Chetan Bansal, Saravan Rajmohan</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 06:01:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12165v2</guid></item><item><title>M^2ConceptBase: A Fine-Grained Aligned Concept-Centric Multimodal Knowledge Base</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10417v2</link><description>Multimodal knowledge bases (MMKBs) provide cross-modal aligned knowledgecrucial for multimodal tasks. However, the images in existing MMKBs aregenerally collected for entities in encyclopedia knowledge graphs. Therefore,detailed groundings of visual semantics with linguistic concepts are lacking,which are essential for the visual concept cognition ability of multimodalmodels. Addressing this gap, we introduce M^2ConceptBase, the firstconcept-centric MMKB. M^2ConceptBase models concepts as nodes with associatedimages and detailed textual descriptions. We propose a context-aware multimodalsymbol grounding approach to align concept-image and concept-description pairsusing context information from image-text datasets. Comprising 951K images and152K concepts, M^2ConceptBase links each concept to an average of 6.27 imagesand a single description, ensuring comprehensive visual and textual semantics.Human studies confirm more than 95% alignment accuracy, underscoring itsquality. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that M^2ConceptBasesignificantly enhances VQA model performance on the OK-VQA task. M^2ConceptBasealso substantially improves the fine-grained concept understanding capabilitiesof multimodal large language models through retrieval augmentation in twoconcept-related tasks, highlighting its value.</description><author>Zhiwei Zha, Jiaan Wang, Zhixu Li, Xiangru Zhu, Wei Song, Yanghua Xiao</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 08:03:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10417v2</guid></item><item><title>OmniParser for Pure Vision Based GUI Agent</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00203v1</link><description>The recent success of large vision language models shows great potential indriving the agent system operating on user interfaces.

However, inconsistent benchmark settings, inadequate baselines, and alack of detailed component analysis have left the necessity of integrating LLMswith search strategies and the true progress achieved by existing LLM-based EPSmethods to be inadequately justified. This work seeks to fulfill these researchqueries by conducting a large-scale benchmark comprising four LLM-based EPSmethods and four AHD problems across nine LLMs and five independent runs.

Identifying the reasons behind a biased system is notstraightforward, since in many occasions they are associated with hiddenspurious correlations which are not easy to spot. Standard approaches rely onbias audits performed by analyzing model performance in pre-defined subgroupsof data samples, usually characterized by common attributes like gender orethnicity when it comes to people, or other specific attributes definingsemantically coherent groups of images. However, it is not always possible toknow a-priori the specific attributes defining the failure modes of visualrecognition systems. Recent approaches propose to discover these groups byleveraging large vision language models, which enable the extraction ofcross-modal embeddings and the generation of textual descriptions tocharacterize the subgroups where a certain model is underperforming. In thiswork, we argue that incorporating visual explanations (e.g. heatmaps generatedvia GradCAM or other approaches) can boost the performance of such biasdiscovery and mitigation frameworks. To this end, we introduce VisuallyGrounded Bias Discovery and Mitigation (ViG-Bias), a simple yet effectivetechnique which can be integrated to a variety of existing frameworks toimprove both, discovery and mitigation performance.

However, prior works focus primarily on geometricreconstruction and visualization, neglecting the key role of language inproviding a semantic interface for navigation and fine-grained understanding.In constrained 3D domains, recent methods have leveraged vision-and-languagemodels as a strong prior of 2D visual semantics. While these models display anexcellent understanding of broad visual semantics, they struggle withunconstrained photo collections depicting such tourist landmarks, as they lackexpert knowledge of the architectural domain. In this work, we present alocalization system that connects neural representations of scenes depictinglarge-scale landmarks with text describing a semantic region within the scene,by harnessing the power of SOTA vision-and-language models with adaptations forunderstanding landmark scene semantics. To bolster such models withfine-grained knowledge, we leverage large-scale Internet data containing imagesof similar landmarks along with weakly-related textual information. Ourapproach is built upon the premise that images physically grounded in space canprovide a powerful supervision signal for localizing new concepts, whosesemantics may be unlocked from Internet textual metadata with large languagemodels. We use correspondences between views of scenes to bootstrap spatialunderstanding of these semantics, providing guidance for 3D-compatiblesegmentation that ultimately lifts to a volumetric scene representation. Ourresults show that HaLo-NeRF can accurately localize a variety of semanticconcepts related to architectural landmarks, surpassing the results of other 3Dmodels as well as strong 2D segmentation baselines.

In particular, we apply this approach to build CUBE(CUltural BEnchmark for Text-to-Image models), a first-of-its-kind benchmark toevaluate cultural competence of T2I models. CUBE covers cultural artifactsassociated with 8 countries across different geo-cultural regions and along 3concepts: cuisine, landmarks, and art.

This paper focuses on the problem ofPharmacovigilance (PhV), where the significance and challenges lie inidentifying Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) from diverse text sources, such asmedical literature, clinical notes, and drug labels. Unfortunately, this taskis hindered by factors including variations in the terminologies of drugs andoutcomes, and ADE descriptions often being buried in large amounts of narrativetext. We present MALADE, the first effective collaborative multi-agent systempowered by LLM with Retrieval Augmented Generation for ADE extraction from druglabel data. This technique involves augmenting a query to an LLM with relevantinformation extracted from text resources, and instructing the LLM to compose aresponse consistent with the augmented data. MALADE is a general LLM-agnosticarchitecture, and its unique capabilities are: (1) leveraging a variety ofexternal sources, such as medical literature, drug labels, and FDA tools (e.g.,OpenFDA drug information API), (2) extracting drug-outcome association in astructured format along with the strength of the association, and (3) providingexplanations for established associations. Instantiated with GPT-4 Turbo orGPT-4o, and FDA drug label data, MALADE demonstrates its efficacy with an AreaUnder ROC Curve of 0.90 against the OMOP Ground Truth table of ADEs.

A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, thegenerated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation.Thus, we raise a question: When presented with a query relevant to thepreviously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respondincorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists? To answer this,we propose a framework called MMHalSnowball to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors whenencountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answerspecific visual questions within a curated hallucinatory conversation.Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of open-source LVLMs dropsby at least $31\%$, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generatedhallucinations and make false claims that they would not have supported withoutdistractions. We term this phenomenon Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing. Tomitigate this, we further propose a training-free method called Residual VisualDecoding, where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs with the one derivedfrom the residual visual input, providing models with direct access to thevisual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than$24\%$ of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintainingcapabilities.</description><author>Weihong Zhong, Xiaocheng Feng, Liang Zhao, Qiming Li, Lei Huang, Yuxuan Gu, Weitao Ma, Yuan Xu, Bing Qin</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Aug 2024 17:52:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00569v4</guid></item><item><title>Should We Fine-Tune or RAG?

Several techniques have beenproposed in the literature for different dialogue types (e.g., Open-Domain).However, the evaluations of these techniques have been limited in terms of baseLLMs, dialogue types and evaluation metrics. In this work, we extensivelyanalyze different LLM adaptation techniques when applied to different dialoguetypes.

We assess the impact ofincorporating external knowledge to ground the generation in both scenarios ofRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and gold knowledge. We adopt consistentevaluation and explainability criteria for automatic metrics and humanevaluation protocols. Our analysis shows that there is no universalbest-technique for adapting large language models as the efficacy of eachtechnique depends on both the base LLM and the specific type of dialogue.

This work unveils the factual information an LLM representsinternally for sentence-level claim verification. We propose an end-to-endframework to decode factual knowledge embedded in token representations from avector space to a set of ground predicates, showing its layer-wise evolutionusing a dynamic knowledge graph. Our framework employs activation patching, avector-level technique that alters a token representation during inference, toextract encoded knowledge. Accordingly, we neither rely on training norexternal models. Using factual and common-sense claims from two claimverification datasets, we showcase interpretability analyses at local andglobal levels. The local analysis highlights entity centrality in LLMreasoning, from claim-related information and multi-hop reasoning torepresentation errors causing erroneous evaluation. On the other hand, theglobal reveals trends in the underlying evolution, such as word-based knowledgeevolving into claim-related facts.

Recent advancements in pre-trained largelanguage models (LLMs) are opening new avenues for generating visualizationsfrom natural language. However, the lack of a comprehensive and reliablebenchmark hinders our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in visualizationgeneration. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a new NL2VISbenchmark called VisEval. Firstly, we introduce a high-quality and large-scaledataset. This dataset includes 2,524 representative queries covering 146databases, paired with accurately labeled ground truths. Secondly, we advocatefor a comprehensive automated evaluation methodology covering multipledimensions, including validity, legality, and readability. By systematicallyscanning for potential issues with a number of heterogeneous checkers, VisEvalprovides reliable and trustworthy evaluation outcomes. We run VisEval on aseries of state-of-the-art LLMs. Our evaluation reveals prevalent challengesand delivers essential insights for future advancements.</description><author>Nan Chen, Yuge Zhang, Jiahang Xu, Kan Ren, Yuqing Yang</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 09:52:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00981v2</guid></item><item><title>Trading Devil Final: Backdoor attack via Stock market and Bayesian Optimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14573v2</link><description>Since the advent of generative artificial intelligence, every company andresearcher has been rushing to develop their own generative models, whethercommercial or not.

Attributed LLMs,which augment generated text with in-line citations, have shown potential inmitigating hallucinations and improving verifiability. However, currentapproaches suffer from suboptimal citation quality due to their reliance onin-context learning. Furthermore, the practice of citing only coarse documentidentifiers makes it challenging for users to perform fine-grainedverification. In this work, we introduce FRONT, a training framework designedto teach LLMs to generate Fine-Grained Grounded Citations. By grounding modeloutputs in fine-grained supporting quotes, these quotes guide the generation ofgrounded and consistent responses, not only improving citation quality but alsofacilitating fine-grained verification. Experiments on the ALCE benchmarkdemonstrate the efficacy of FRONT in generating superior grounded responses andhighly supportive citations.

However, long-term mental well-being requires emotionalself-regulation, where a one-time empathic response falls short. This worktakes a first step by engaging with cognitive reappraisals, a strategy frompsychology practitioners that uses language to targetedly change negativeappraisals that an individual makes of the situation; such appraisals is knownto sit at the root of human emotional experience. We hypothesize thatpsychologically grounded principles could enable such advanced psychologycapabilities in LLMs, and design RESORT which consists of a series ofreappraisal constitutions across multiple dimensions that can be used as LLMinstructions. We conduct a first-of-its-kind expert evaluation (by clinicalpsychologists with M.S. or Ph.D. degrees) of an LLM's zero-shot ability togenerate cognitive reappraisal responses to medium-length social media messagesasking for support. This fine-grained evaluation showed that even LLMs at the7B scale guided by RESORT are capable of generating empathic responses that canhelp users reappraise their situations.</description><author>Hongli Zhan, Allen Zheng, Yoon Kyung Lee, Jina Suh, Junyi Jessy Li, Desmond C.

Checkpoint has emerged as the predominantfault tolerance strategy, with extensive studies dedicated to optimizing itsefficiency. However, the advent of the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) modelpresents new challenges for traditional checkpoint techniques due to thesubstantial increase in model size, despite comparable computational demands todense models. Breaking new ground in the realm of efficient fault tolerance forMoE model training, we introduce a novel Partial Experts Checkpoint (PEC)mechanism alongside a corresponding PEC fault-tolerant system. Our approachstrategically checkpoints a selected subset of experts, thereby significantlyreducing the checkpoint size for MoE models to a level comparable with that ofdense models. The empirical analysis on our 8-expert GPT-MoE model demonstratesthat the proposed PEC approach facilitates a substantial 54.2% decrease in thesize of non-redundant checkpoint (no data-parallel duplication), withoutcompromising the final model quality. Moreover, our PEC fault-tolerant systemachieves a 76.9% reduction in checkpoint workload per data-parallel distributedrank, thereby correspondingly diminishing the checkpointing time andfacilitating complete overlap with the training process.</description><author>Weilin Cai, Le Qin, Jiayi Huang</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 08:40:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04307v1</guid></item><item><title>PersLLM: A Personified Training Approach for Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12393v4</link><description>Large language models exhibit aspects of human-level intelligence thatcatalyze their application as human-like agents in domains such as socialsimulations, human-machine interactions, and collaborative multi-agent systems.However, the absence of distinct personalities, such as displaying ingratiatingbehaviors, inconsistent opinions, and uniform response patterns, diminish LLMsutility in practical applications. Addressing this, the development ofpersonality traits in LLMs emerges as a crucial area of research to unlocktheir latent potential. Existing methods to personify LLMs generally involvestrategies like employing stylized training data for instruction tuning orusing prompt engineering to simulate different personalities. These methodsonly capture superficial linguistic styles instead of the core of personalitiesand are therefore not stable. In this study, we propose PersLLM, integratingpsychology-grounded principles of personality: social practice, consistency,and dynamic development, into a comprehensive training methodology. Weincorporate personality traits directly into the model parameters, enhancingthe model's resistance to induction, promoting consistency, and supporting thedynamic evolution of personality. Single-agent evaluation validates ourmethod's superiority, as it produces responses more aligned with referencepersonalities compared to other approaches. Case studies for multi-agentcommunication highlight its benefits in enhancing opinion consistency withinindividual agents and fostering collaborative creativity among multiple agentsin dialogue contexts, potentially benefiting human simulation and multi-agentcooperation.

This work conducts atimely and comprehensive study of Video-LLMs' behavior in VideoQA, aiming toelucidate their success and failure modes, and provide insights towards morehuman-like video understanding and question answering. Our analyses demonstratethat Video-LLMs excel in VideoQA; they can correlate contextual cues andgenerate plausible responses to questions about varied video contents. However,models falter in handling video temporality, both in reasoning about temporalcontent ordering and grounding QA-relevant temporal moments. Moreover, themodels behave unintuitively - they are unresponsive to adversarial videoperturbations while being sensitive to simple variations of candidate answersand questions. Also, they do not necessarily generalize better.

However, in addition tocross-cultural differences, there also exists common ground across cultures.For instance, a bridal veil in the United States plays a similarcultural-relevant role as a honggaitou in China. In this study, we introduce abenchmark dataset CUNIT for evaluating decoder-only LLMs in understanding thecultural unity of concepts. Specifically, CUNIT consists of 1,425 evaluationexamples building upon 285 traditional cultural-specific concepts across 10countries. Based on a systematic manual annotation of cultural-relevantfeatures per concept, we calculate the cultural association between any pair ofcross-cultural concepts. Built upon this dataset, we design a contrastivematching task to evaluate the LLMs' capability to identify highly associatedcross-cultural concept pairs. We evaluate 3 strong LLMs, using 3 popularprompting strategies, under the settings of either giving all extracted conceptfeatures or no features at all on CUNIT Interestingly, we find that culturalassociations across countries regarding clothing concepts largely differ fromfood. Our analysis shows that LLMs are still limited to capturingcross-cultural associations between concepts compared to humans.

This success has inspired researchers to explore theuse of transformers in computer vision tasks to attain enhanced long-termsemantic awareness. Vision transformers (ViTs) have excelled in variouscomputer vision tasks due to their superior ability to capture long-distancedependencies using the self-attention mechanism. Contemporary ViTs like DataEfficient Transformers (DeiT) can effectively learn both global semanticinformation and local texture information from images, achieving performancecomparable to traditional CNNs. However, their impressive performance comeswith a high computational cost due to very large number of parameters,hindering their deployment on devices with limited resources like smartphones,cameras, drones etc. Additionally, ViTs require a large amount of data fortraining to achieve performance comparable to benchmark CNN models. Therefore,we identified two key challenges in deploying ViTs on smaller form factordevices: the high computational requirements of large models and the need forextensive training data. As a solution to these challenges, we proposecompressing large ViT models using Knowledge Distillation (KD), which isimplemented data-free to circumvent limitations related to data availability.Additionally, we conducted experiments on object detection within the sameenvironment in addition to classification tasks.

Despite their success, they also haveinherent limitations such as a lack of up-to-date knowledge and hallucination.Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a state-of-the-art technique tomitigate these limitations. The key idea of RAG is to ground the answergeneration of an LLM on external knowledge retrieved from a knowledge database.Existing studies mainly focus on improving the accuracy or efficiency of RAG,leaving its security largely unexplored. We aim to bridge the gap in this work.We find that the knowledge database in a RAG system introduces a new andpractical attack surface. Based on this attack surface, we propose PoisonedRAG,the first knowledge corruption attack to RAG, where an attacker could inject afew malicious texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce anLLM to generate an attacker-chosen target answer for an attacker-chosen targetquestion. We formulate knowledge corruption attacks as an optimization problem,whose solution is a set of malicious texts. Depending on the backgroundknowledge (e.g., black-box and white-box settings) of an attacker on a RAGsystem, we propose two solutions to solve the optimization problem,respectively. Our results show PoisonedRAG could achieve a 90% attack successrate when injecting five malicious texts for each target question into aknowledge database with millions of texts. We also evaluate several defensesand our results show they are insufficient to defend against PoisonedRAG,highlighting the need for new defenses.</description><author>Wei Zou, Runpeng Geng, Binghui Wang, Jinyuan Jia</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 21:46:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07867v2</guid></item><item><title>The Cognitive Revolution in Interpretability: From Explaining Behavior to Interpreting Representations and Algorithms</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05859v1</link><description>Artificial neural networks have long been understood as "black boxes": thoughwe know their computation graphs and learned parameters, the knowledge encodedby these weights and functions they perform are not inherently interpretable.As such, from the early days of deep learning, there have been efforts toexplain these models' behavior and understand them internally; and recently,mechanistic interpretability (MI) has emerged as a distinct research areastudying the features and implicit algorithms learned by foundation models suchas large language models. In this work, we aim to ground MI in the context ofcognitive science, which has long struggled with analogous questions instudying and explaining the behavior of "black box" intelligent systems likethe human brain. We leverage several important ideas and developments in thehistory of cognitive science to disentangle divergent objectives in MI andindicate a clear path forward. First, we argue that current methods are ripe tofacilitate a transition in deep learning interpretation echoing the "cognitiverevolution" in 20th-century psychology that shifted the study of humanpsychology from pure behaviorism toward mental representations and processing.Second, we propose a taxonomy mirroring key parallels in computationalneuroscience to describe two broad categories of MI research, semanticinterpretation (what latent representations are learned and used) andalgorithmic interpretation (what operations are performed over representations)to elucidate their divergent goals and objects of study. Finally, we elaboratethe parallels and distinctions between various approaches in both categories,analyze the respective strengths and weaknesses of representative works,clarify underlying assumptions, outline key challenges, and discuss thepossibility of unifying these modes of interpretation under a common framework.</description><author>Adam Davies, Ashkan Khakzar</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 20:50:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05859v1</guid></item><item><title>Bridging Information Gaps in Dialogues With Grounded Exchanges Using Knowledge Graphs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01088v2</link><description>Knowledge models are fundamental to dialogue systems for enablingconversational interactions, which require handling domain-specific knowledge.Ensuring effective communication in information-providing conversations entailsaligning user understanding with the knowledge available to the system.However, dialogue systems often face challenges arising from semanticinconsistencies in how information is expressed in natural language compared tohow it is represented within the system's internal knowledge. To address thisproblem, we study the potential of large language models for conversationalgrounding, a mechanism to bridge information gaps by establishing sharedknowledge between dialogue participants. Our approach involves annotating humanconversations across five knowledge domains to create a new dialogue corpuscalled BridgeKG. Through a series of experiments on this dataset, weempirically evaluate the capabilities of large language models in classifyinggrounding acts and identifying grounded information items within a knowledgegraph structure. Our findings offer insights into how these models usein-context learning for conversational grounding tasks and common predictionerrors, which we illustrate with examples from challenging dialogues. Wediscuss how the models handle knowledge graphs as a semantic layer betweenunstructured dialogue utterances and structured information items.</description><author>Phillip Schneider, Nektarios Machner, Kristiina Jokinen, Florian Matthes</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 17:51:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01088v2</guid></item><item><title>Evaluating Large Language Models with Grid-Based Game Competitions: An Extensible LLM Benchmark and Leaderboard</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07796v2</link><description>We introduce a novel and extensible benchmark for large language models(LLMs) through grid-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku.The open-source game simulation code, available on GitHub, allows LLMs tocompete and generates detailed data files in JSON, CSV, TXT, and PNG formatsfor leaderboard rankings and further analysis. We present the results of gamesamong leading LLMs, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Sonnet byAnthropic, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash by Google, GPT-4 Turbo andGPT-4o by OpenAI, and Llama3-70B by Meta. We also encourage submissions ofresults from other LLMs. In total, we simulated 2,310 matches (5 sessions foreach pair among 7 LLMs and a random player) across three types of games, usingthree distinct prompt types: list, illustration, and image. The resultsrevealed significant variations in LLM performance across different games andprompt types, with analysis covering win and disqualification rates, missedopportunity analysis, and invalid move analysis. The details of the leaderboardand result matrix data are available as open-access data on GitHub. This studyenhances our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in playing games they were notspecifically trained for, helping to assess their rule comprehension andstrategic thinking. On the path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), thisstudy lays the groundwork for future exploration into their utility in complexdecision-making scenarios, illuminating their strategic thinking abilities andoffering directions for further inquiry into the limits of LLMs withingame-based frameworks.</description><author>Oguzhan Topsakal, Colby Jacob Edell, Jackson Bailey Harper</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 03:46:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07796v2</guid></item></channel></rss>
