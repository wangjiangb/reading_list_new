This study first analyzesthe fine-tuning dynamics of encoder-based PLMs and demonstrates theirrobustness against degeneration. On the basis of this analysis, we proposeDefinitionEMB, a method that utilizes definitions to re-construct isotropicallydistributed and semantics-related token embeddings for encoder-based PLMs whilemaintaining original robustness during fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstratethe effectiveness of leveraging definitions from Wiktionary to re-constructsuch embeddings for two encoder-based PLMs: RoBERTa-base and BART-large.Furthermore, the re-constructed embeddings for low-frequency tokens improve theperformance of these models across various GLUE and four text summarizationdatasets.</description><author>Ying Zhang, Dongyuan Li, Manabu Okumura</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2024 08:08:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01308v2</guid></item><item><title>Abstractive Text Summarization for Contemporary Sanskrit Prose: Issues and Challenges</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01933v1</link><description>This thesis presents Abstractive Text Summarization models for contemporarySanskrit prose.

Existingindustry solutions, especially latency-constrained services, often rely onsimilarity algorithms that sacrifice quality for speed. In this paper weintroduce a generic semantic learning-to-rank framework, Self-training SemanticCross-attention Ranking (sRank). This transformer-based framework uses linearpairwise loss with mutable training batch sizes and achieves quality gains andhigh efficiency, and has been applied effectively to show gains on two industrytasks at Microsoft over real-world large-scale data sets: Smart Reply (SR) andAmbient Clinical Intelligence (ACI). In Smart Reply, sRank assists livecustomers with technical support by selecting the best reply from predefinedsolutions based on consumer and support agent messages. It achieves 11.7% gainin offline top-one accuracy on the SR task over the previous system, and hasenabled 38.7% time reduction in composing messages in telemetry recorded sinceits general release in January 2021. In the ACI task, sRank selects relevanthistorical physician templates that serve as guidance for a text summarizationmodel to generate higher quality medical notes. It achieves 35.5% top-oneaccuracy gain, along with 46% relative ROUGE-L gain in generated medical notes.</description><author>Xiaofeng Zhu, Thomas Lin, Vishal Anand, Matthew Calderwood, Eric Clausen-Brown, Gord Lueck, Wen-wai Yim, Cheng Wu</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 15:42:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04918v2</guid></item><item><title>A BERT-Based Summarization approach for depression detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08483v1</link><description>Depression is a globally prevalent mental disorder with potentially severerepercussions if not addressed, especially in individuals with recurrentepisodes. Prior research has shown that early intervention has the potential tomitigate or alleviate symptoms of depression. However, implementing suchinterventions in a real-world setting may pose considerable challenges. Apromising strategy involves leveraging machine learning and artificialintelligence to autonomously detect depression indicators from diverse datasources. One of the most widely available and informative data sources is text,which can reveal a person's mood, thoughts, and feelings. In this context,virtual agents programmed to conduct interviews using clinically validatedquestionnaires, such as those found in the DAIC-WOZ dataset, offer a robustmeans for depression detection through linguistic analysis. UtilizingBERT-based models, which are powerful and versatile yet use fewer resourcesthan contemporary large language models, to convert text into numericalrepresentations significantly enhances the precision of depression diagnosis.These models adeptly capture complex semantic and syntactic nuances, improvingthe detection accuracy of depressive symptoms. Given the inherent limitationsof these models concerning text length, our study proposes text summarizationas a preprocessing technique to diminish the length and intricacies of inputtexts. Implementing this method within our uniquely developed framework forfeature extraction and classification yielded an F1-score of 0.67 on the testset surpassing all prior benchmarks and 0.81 on the validation set exceedingmost previous results on the DAIC-WOZ dataset. Furthermore, we have devised adepression lexicon to assess summary quality and relevance. This lexiconconstitutes a valuable asset for ongoing research in depression detection.</description><author>Hossein Salahshoor Gavalan, Mohmmad Naim Rastgoo, Bahareh Nakisa</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 02:14:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08483v1</guid></item><item><title>MA-RLHF: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Macro Actions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02743v1</link><description>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstratedeffectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.However, token-level RLHF suffers from the credit assignment problem over longsequences, where delayed rewards make it challenging for the model to discernwhich actions contributed to successful outcomes. This hinders learningefficiency and slows convergence. In this paper, we propose MA-RLHF, a simpleyet effective RLHF framework that incorporates macro actions -- sequences oftokens or higher-level language constructs -- into the learning process. Byoperating at this higher level of abstraction, our approach reduces thetemporal distance between actions and rewards, facilitating faster and moreaccurate credit assignment. This results in more stable policy gradientestimates and enhances learning efficiency within each episode, all withoutincreasing computational complexity during training or inference. We validateour approach through extensive experiments across various model sizes andtasks, including text summarization, dialogue generation, question answering,and program synthesis. Our method achieves substantial performance improvementsover standard RLHF, with performance gains of up to 30% in text summarizationand code generation, 18% in dialogue, and 8% in question answering tasks.Notably, our approach reaches parity with vanilla RLHF 1.7x to 2x faster interms of training time and continues to outperform it with further training.

However, extractingstructured knowledge from scientific text by NLP models remains a challengebecause of its domain-specific nature to complex data preprocessing and thegranularity of multi-layered device-level information. To address this, weintroduce ByteScience, a non-profit cloud-based auto fine-tuned Large LanguageModel (LLM) platform, which is designed to extract structured scientific dataand synthesize new scientific knowledge from vast scientific corpora. Theplatform capitalizes on DARWIN, an open-source, fine-tuned LLM dedicated tonatural science. The platform was built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) andprovides an automated, user-friendly workflow for custom model development anddata extraction.

However, crafting effective prompts that guide LLMs to generatesummaries with the appropriate level of detail and writing style remains achallenge. In this paper, we explore the use of salient information extractedfrom the source document to enhance summarization prompts. We show that addingkeyphrases in prompts can improve ROUGE F1 and recall, making the generatedsummaries more similar to the reference and more complete. The number ofkeyphrases can control the precision-recall trade-off. Furthermore, ouranalysis reveals that incorporating phrase-level salient information issuperior to word- or sentence-level. However, the impact on hallucination isnot universally positive across LLMs. To conduct this analysis, we introduceKeyphrase Signal Extractor (CriSPO), a lightweight model that can be finetunedto extract salient keyphrases. By using CriSPO, we achieve consistent ROUGEimprovements across datasets and open-weight and proprietary LLMs without anyLLM customization.

Notably, the reference-free factuality evaluation framework doesn'tneed ground truth and hence it has a wider application scenario.

Traditionalmethods for chart understanding and summarization often rely on multi-stagepipelines, which may produce suboptimal semantic alignment between visual andtextual information. In comparison, recently developed LLM-based methods aremore dependent on the capability of foundation images or languages, whileignoring the characteristics of chart data and its relevant challenges. Toaddress these limitations, we propose ChartAdapter, a novel lightweighttransformer module designed to bridge the gap between charts and textualsummaries. ChartAdapter employs learnable query vectors to extract implicitsemantics from chart data and incorporates a cross-modal alignment projector toenhance vision-to-language generative learning. By integrating ChartAdapterwith an LLM, we enable end-to-end training and efficient chart summarization.To further enhance the training, we introduce a three-stage hierarchicaltraining procedure and develop a large-scale dataset specifically curated forchart summarization, comprising 190,618 samples. Experimental results on thestandard Chart-to-Text testing set demonstrate that our approach significantlyoutperforms existing methods, including state-of-the-art models, in generatinghigh-quality chart summaries. Ablation studies further validate theeffectiveness of key components in ChartAdapter. This work highlights thepotential of tailored LLM-based approaches to advance chart understanding andsets a strong foundation for future research in this area.</description><author>Peixin Xu, Yujuan Ding, Wenqi Fan</author><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2024 05:07:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20715v1</guid></item><item><title>MixSumm: Topic-based Data Augmentation using LLMs for Low-resource Extractive Text Summarization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07341v1</link><description>Low-resource extractive text summarization is a vital but heavilyunderexplored area of research.

If theuser's preference is known, video summarization can identify significantinformation or relevant content from an input video, aiding them in obtainingthe necessary information or determining their interest in watching theoriginal video. Adapting video summarization to various types of video and userpreferences requires significant training data and expensive human labeling. Tofacilitate such research, we proposed a new benchmark for video summarizationthat captures various user preferences. Also, we present a pipeline calledVideo Summarization with Language (VSL) for user-preferred video summarizationthat is based on pre-trained visual language models (VLMs) to avoid the need totrain a video summarization system on a large training dataset. The pipelinetakes both video and closed captioning as input and performs semantic analysisat the scene level by converting video frames into text. Subsequently, theuser's genre preference was used as the basis for selecting the pertinenttextual scenes. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed pipelineoutperforms current state-of-the-art unsupervised video summarization models.We show that our method is more adaptable across different datasets compared tosupervised query-based video summarization models.

Recent advancements in large language models(LLMs) have significantly enhanced their capability in understanding andsummarizing complex medical texts. This research aims to explore how LLMs canalleviate the burden of manual summarization, streamline workflow efficiencies,and support informed decision-making in healthcare settings. Clinical notesfrom a cohort of 1,099 lung cancer patients were utilized, with a subset of 50patients for testing purposes, and 102 patients used for model fine-tuning.This study evaluates the performance of multiple LLMs, including GPT-3.5,GPT-4, GPT-4o, and LLaMA 3 8b, in generating discharge summaries. Evaluationmetrics included token-level analysis (BLEU, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L) andsemantic similarity scores between model-generated summaries andphysician-written gold standards. LLaMA 3 8b was further tested on clinicalnotes of varying lengths to examine the stability of its performance. The studyfound notable variations in summarization capabilities among LLMs. GPT-4o andfine-tuned LLaMA 3 demonstrated superior token-level evaluation metrics, whileLLaMA 3 consistently produced concise summaries across different input lengths.Semantic similarity scores indicated GPT-4o and LLaMA 3 as leading models incapturing clinical relevance. This study contributes insights into the efficacyof LLMs for generating discharge summaries, highlighting LLaMA 3's robustperformance in maintaining clarity and relevance across varying clinicalcontexts. These findings underscore the potential of automated summarizationtools to enhance documentation precision and efficiency, ultimately improvingpatient care and operational capability in healthcare settings.</description><author>Yiming Li, Fang Li, Kirk Roberts, Licong Cui, Cui Tao, Hua Xu</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 10:02:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03805v1</guid></item><item><title>AutoAD-Zero: A Training-Free Framework for Zero-Shot Audio Description</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15850v1</link><description>Our objective is to generate Audio Descriptions (ADs) for both movies and TVseries in a training-free manner.

Based onPassTSL, we also implemented a password strength meter (PSM), and ourexperiments showed that it was able to estimate password strength moreaccurately, causing fewer unsafe errors (overestimating the password strength)than two other SOTA PSMs when they produce the same rate of safe errors(underestimating the password strength): a neural-network based method andzxcvbn. Furthermore, we explored multiple finetuning settings, and ourevaluations showed that, even a small amount of additional training data, e.g.,only 0.1% of the pretrained data, can lead to over 3% improvement in passwordguessing on average. We also proposed a heuristic approach to selectingfinetuning passwords based on JS (Jensen-Shannon) divergence and experimentalresults validated its usefulness. In summary, our contributions demonstrate thepotential and feasibility of applying advanced NLP and ML methods to passwordmodeling and cracking.</description><author>Yangde Wang, Haozhang Li, Weidong Qiu, Shujun Li, Peng Tang</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 09:23:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14145v1</guid></item><item><title>AdaptEval: Evaluating Large Language Models on Domain Adaptation for Text Summarization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11591v1</link><description>Despite the advances in the abstractive summarization task using LargeLanguage Models (LLM), there is a lack of research that asses their abilitiesto easily adapt to different domains.

For instance, LLMs occasionally generate contentthat diverges from source article, and prefer to extract information thatappears at the beginning and end of the context, especially in long documentsummarization. Inspired by these findings, we propose to improve thefaithfulness of LLMs in summarization by impelling them to process the entirearticle more fairly and faithfully. We present a novel summary generationstrategy, namely SliSum, which exploits the ideas of sliding windows andself-consistency. Specifically, SliSum divides the source article intooverlapping windows, and utilizes LLM to generate local summaries for thecontent in the windows. Finally, SliSum aggregates all local summaries usingclustering and majority voting algorithm to produce more faithful summary ofentire article. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SliSum significantlyimproves the faithfulness of diverse LLMs including LLaMA-2, Claude-2 andGPT-3.5 in both short and long text summarization, while maintaining theirfluency and informativeness and without additional fine-tuning and resources.We further conduct qualitative and quantitative studies to investigate whySliSum works and impacts of hyperparameters in SliSum on performance.</description><author>Taiji Li, Zhi Li, Yin Zhang</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 08:48:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21443v1</guid></item><item><title>Multi-sentence Video Grounding for Long Video Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13219v1</link><description>Video generation has witnessed great success recently, but their applicationin generating long videos still remains challenging due to the difficulty inmaintaining the temporal consistency of generated videos and the high memorycost during generation. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we propose abrave and new idea of Multi-sentence Video Grounding for Long Video Generation,connecting the massive video moment retrieval to the video generation task forthe first time, providing a new paradigm for long video generation. The methodof our work can be summarized as three steps: (i) We design sequential scenetext prompts as the queries for video grounding, utilizing the massive videomoment retrieval to search for video moment segments that meet the textrequirements in the video database. (ii) Based on the source frames ofretrieved video moment segments, we adopt video editing methods to create newvideo content while preserving the temporal consistency of the retrieved video.Since the editing can be conducted segment by segment, and even frame by frame,it largely reduces the memory cost. (iii) We also attempt video morphing andpersonalized generation methods to improve the subject consistency of longvideo generation, providing ablation experimental results for the subtasks oflong video generation. Our approach seamlessly extends the development inimage/video editing, video morphing and personalized generation, and videogrounding to the long video generation, offering effective solutions forgenerating long videos at low memory cost.</description><author>Wei Feng, Xin Wang, Hong Chen, Zeyang Zhang, Wenwu Zhu</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2024 07:05:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13219v1</guid></item><item><title>Synthesizing Scientific Summaries: An Extractive and Abstractive Approach</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19779v1</link><description>The availability of a vast array of research papers in any area of study,necessitates the need of automated summarisation systems that can present thekey research conducted and their corresponding findings. Scientific papersummarisation is a challenging task for various reasons including token lengthlimits in modern transformer models and corresponding memory and computerequirements for long text. A significant amount of work has been conducted inthis area, with approaches that modify the attention mechanisms of existingtransformer models and others that utilise discourse information to capturelong range dependencies in research papers. In this paper, we propose a hybridmethodology for research paper summarisation which incorporates an extractiveand abstractive approach. We use the extractive approach to capture the keyfindings of research, and pair it with the introduction of the paper whichcaptures the motivation for research. We use two models based on unsupervisedlearning for the extraction stage and two transformer language models,resulting in four combinations for our hybrid approach. The performances of themodels are evaluated on three metrics and we present our findings in thispaper. We find that using certain combinations of hyper parameters, it ispossible for automated summarisation systems to exceed the abstractiveness ofsummaries written by humans.

We introduce anew suite of compression methods suitable for compression with biased inputsequences. Given $n$ points targeting the wrong distribution and quadratictime, Stein kernel thinning (SKT) returns $\sqrt{n}$ equal-weighted points with$\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/2})$ maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to $\mathbb{P}$. Forlarger-scale compression tasks, low-rank SKT achieves the same feat insub-quadratic time using an adaptive low-rank debiasing procedure that may beof independent interest. For downstream tasks that support simplex orconstant-preserving weights, Stein recombination and Stein Cholesky achieveeven greater parsimony, matching the guarantees of SKT with as few as$\text{poly-log}(n)$ weighted points. Underlying these advances are newguarantees for the quality of simplex-weighted coresets, the spectral decay ofkernel matrices, and the covering numbers of Stein kernel Hilbert spaces. Inour experiments, our techniques provide succinct and accurate posteriorsummaries while overcoming biases due to burn-in, approximate Markov chainMonte Carlo, and tempering.</description><author>Lingxiao Li, Raaz Dwivedi, Lester Mackey</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 20:32:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12290v3</guid></item><item><title>Sentence-wise Speech Summarization: Task, Datasets, and End-to-End Modeling with LM Knowledge Distillation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00205v1</link><description>This paper introduces a novel approach called sentence-wise speechsummarization (Sen-SSum), which generates text summaries from a spoken documentin a sentence-by-sentence manner. Sen-SSum combines the real-time processing ofautomatic speech recognition (ASR) with the conciseness of speechsummarization. To explore this approach, we present two datasets for Sen-SSum:Mega-SSum and CSJ-SSum. Using these datasets, our study evaluates two types ofTransformer-based models: 1) cascade models that combine ASR and strong textsummarization models, and 2) end-to-end (E2E) models that directly convertspeech into a text summary. While E2E models are appealing to developcompute-efficient models, they perform worse than cascade models. Therefore, wepropose knowledge distillation for E2E models using pseudo-summaries generatedby the cascade models. Our experiments show that this proposed knowledgedistillation effectively improves the performance of the E2E model on bothdatasets.</description><author>Kohei Matsuura, Takanori Ashihara, Takafumi Moriya, Masato Mimura, Takatomo Kano, Atsunori Ogawa, Marc Delcroix</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 00:18:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00205v1</guid></item><item><title>From Attributes to Natural Language: A Survey and Foresight on Text-based Person Re-identification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00096v1</link><description>Text-based person re-identification (Re-ID) is a challenging topic in thefield of complex multimodal analysis, its ultimate aim is to recognize specificpedestrians by scrutinizing attributes/natural language descriptions.

This evolution manifests through neologisms (new words) or\textbf{semantic changes} of words (new meaning to existing words).Understanding the meaning of words is vital for interpreting texts coming fromdifferent cultures (regionalism or slang), domains (e.g., technical terms), orperiods. In computer science, these words are relevant to computationallinguistics algorithms such as translation, information retrieval, questionanswering, etc. Semantic changes can potentially impact the quality of theoutcomes of these algorithms. Therefore, it is important to understand andcharacterize these changes formally. The study of this impact is a recentproblem that has attracted the attention of the computational linguisticscommunity. Several approaches propose methods to detect semantic changes withgood precision, but more effort is needed to characterize how the meaning ofwords changes and to reason about how to reduce the impact of semantic change.This survey provides an understandable overview of existing approaches to the\textit{characterization of semantic changes} and also formally defines threeclasses of characterizations: if the meaning of a word becomes more general ornarrow (change in dimension) if the word is used in a more pejorative orpositive/ameliorated sense (change in orientation), and if there is a trend touse the word in a, for instance, metaphoric or metonymic context (change inrelation).

Large language models (LLMs) show greatpotential in summarization, offering enhanced coherence and contextunderstanding compared to traditional methods. However, they still struggle tomaintain relevance and avoid hallucination. We introduce a multi-LLM correctionapproach for meeting summarization using a two-phase process that mimics thehuman review process: mistake identification and summary refinement. We releaseQMSum Mistake, a dataset of 200 automatically generated meeting summariesannotated by humans on nine error types, including structural, omission, andirrelevance errors. Our experiments show that these errors can be identifiedwith high accuracy by an LLM. We transform identified mistakes into actionablefeedback to improve the quality of a given summary measured by relevance,informativeness, conciseness, and coherence. This post-hoc refinementeffectively improves summary quality by leveraging multiple LLMs to validateoutput quality.

However, a significant challenge lies in thebrittleness of existing ITR benchmarks. In standard datasets for the task,captions often provide broad summaries of scenes, neglecting detailedinformation about specific concepts. Additionally, the current evaluation setupassumes simplistic binary matches between images and texts and focuses onintra-modality rather than cross-modal relationships, which can lead tomisinterpretations of model performance. Motivated by this gap, in this study,we focus on examining the brittleness of the ITR evaluation pipeline with afocus on concept granularity. We start by analyzing two common benchmarks,MS-COCO and Flickr30k, and compare them with their augmented versions,MS-COCO-FG and Flickr30k-FG, given a specified set of linguistic featurescapturing concept granularity. We discover that Flickr30k-FG and MS COCO-FGconsistently achieve higher scores across all the selected features. Toinvestigate the performance of VLMs on coarse and fine-grained datasets, weintroduce a taxonomy of perturbations. We apply these perturbations to theselected datasets. We evaluate four state-of-the-art models - ALIGN, AltCLIP,CLIP, and GroupViT - on the standard and fine-grained datasets under zero-shotconditions, with and without the applied perturbations. The results demonstratethat although perturbations generally degrade model performance, thefine-grained datasets exhibit a smaller performance drop than their standardcounterparts. Moreover, the relative performance drop across all setups isconsistent across all models and datasets, indicating that the issue lieswithin the benchmarks.

Prior work has learned strong visualrepresentations with local or global captioning losses, but fails to retainboth granularities. To combat this, we propose Textual Foresight, a novelpretraining objective for learning UI screen representations. Textual Foresightgenerates global text descriptions of future UI states given a current UI andlocal action taken. Our approach requires joint reasoning over elements andentire screens, resulting in improved UI features: on generation tasks, UIagents trained with Textual Foresight outperform state-of-the-art by 2% with28x fewer images. We train with our newly constructed mobile app dataset,OpenApp, which results in the first public dataset for app UI representationlearning. OpenApp enables new baselines, and we find Textual Foresight improvesaverage task performance over them by 5.7% while having access to 2x less data.</description><author>Andrea Burns, Kate Saenko, Bryan A.

In this work, we focus on Regesta Pontificum Romanum, alarge collection of papal registers. Regesta are visually rich documents, wherethe layout is as important as the text content to convey the containedinformation through the structure, and are inherently multi-page documents.Among Digital Humanities techniques that can help scholars efficiently exploitregesta and other documental sources in the form of scanned documents, DocumentParsing has emerged as a task to process document images and convert them intomachine-readable structured representations, usually markup language. However,current models focus on scientific and business documents, and most of themconsider only single-paged documents. To overcome this limitation, in thiswork, we propose {\mu}gat, an extension of the recently proposed Documentparsing Nougat architecture, which can handle elements spanning over the singlepage limits. Specifically, we adapt Nougat to process a larger, multi-pagecontext, consisting of the previous and the following page, while parsing thecurrent page.

The effectiveness of text clustering largely depends onthe selection of textual embeddings and clustering algorithms. This studyargues that recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have thepotential to enhance this task. The research investigates how different textualembeddings, particularly those utilised in LLMs, and various clusteringalgorithms influence the clustering of text datasets. A series of experimentswere conducted to evaluate the impact of embeddings on clustering results, therole of dimensionality reduction through summarisation, and the adjustment ofmodel size. The findings indicate that LLM embeddings are superior at capturingsubtleties in structured language. OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model yields betterresults in three out of five clustering metrics across most tested datasets.Most LLM embeddings show improvements in cluster purity and provide a moreinformative silhouette score, reflecting a refined structural understanding oftext data compared to traditional methods. Among the more lightweight models,BERT demonstrates leading performance. Additionally, it was observed thatincreasing model dimensionality and employing summarisation techniques do notconsistently enhance clustering efficiency, suggesting that these strategiesrequire careful consideration for practical application. These resultshighlight a complex balance between the need for refined text representationand computational feasibility in text clustering applications. This studyextends traditional text clustering frameworks by integrating embeddings fromLLMs, offering improved methodologies and suggesting new avenues for futureresearch in various types of textual analysis.</description><author>Alina Petukhova, João P.

However, the prevalent approach used intext generation, Causal Language Modelling (CLM), which generates textsequentially from left to right, inherently limits the freedom of the model,which does not decide when and where each token is generated. In contrast,Masked Language Modelling (MLM), primarily used for language understandingtasks, can generate tokens anywhere in the text and any order. This paperconducts an extensive comparison of MLM and CLM approaches for text generationtasks. To do so, we pre-train several language models of comparable sizes onthree different datasets, namely 1) medical discharge summaries, 2) movie plotsynopses, and 3) authorship verification datasets. To assess the quality of thegenerations, we first employ quantitative metrics and then perform aqualitative human evaluation to analyse coherence and grammatical correctness.In addition, we evaluate the usefulness of the generated texts by using them inthree different downstream tasks: 1) Entity Recognition, 2) TextClassification, and 3) Authorship Verification. The results show that MLMconsistently outperforms CLM in text generation across all datasets, withhigher quantitative scores and better coherence in the generated text. Thestudy also finds \textit{no strong correlation} between the quality of thegenerated text and the performance of the models in the downstream tasks. Withthis study, we show that MLM for text generation has great potential for futureresearch and provides direction for future studies in this area.</description><author>Nicolo Micheletti, Samuel Belkadi, Lifeng Han, Goran Nenadic</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 00:01:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12630v2</guid></item><item><title>Tamil Language Computing: the Present and the Future</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08618v2</link><description>This paper delves into the text processing aspects of Language Computing,which enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.Focusing on tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, sentimentanalysis, text summarization, and language modelling, language computingintegrates disciplines including linguistics, computer science, and cognitivepsychology to create meaningful human-computer interactions.

In the era of generative AI, coherenceassessment is essential for many NLP tasks; summarization, generation,long-form question-answering, and more. However, in NLP {coherence} is anill-defined notion, not having a formal definition or evaluation metrics, thatwould allow for large-scale automatic and systematic coherence assessment. Tobridge this gap, in this work we employ the formal linguistic definition of\citet{Reinhart:1980} of what makes a discourse coherent, consisting of threeconditions -- {\em cohesion, consistency} and {\em relevance} -- and formalizethese conditions as respective computational tasks. We hypothesize that (i) amodel trained on all of these tasks will learn the features required forcoherence detection, and that (ii) a joint model for all tasks will exceed theperformance of models trained on each task individually. On two benchmarks forcoherence scoring rated by humans, one containing 500 automatically-generatedshort stories and another containing 4k real-world texts, our experimentsconfirm that jointly training on the proposed tasks leads to better performanceon each task compared with task-specific models, and to better performance onassessing coherence overall, compared with strong baselines. We conclude thatthe formal and computational setup of coherence as proposed here provides asolid foundation for advanced methods of large-scale automatic assessment ofcoherence.</description><author>Aviya Maimon, Reut Tsarfaty</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 13:19:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00598v2</guid></item><item><title>Keep the Cost Down: A Review on Methods to Optimize LLM' s KV-Cache Consumption</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18003v3</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT' s release in late 2022,have revolutionized various industries with their advanced languagecomprehension.

These datasets canbe difficult to collect, limited in scope, and vary in sample quality.Additionally, datasets can vary extensively in supervision format, fromnumerical to binary as well as multi-dimensional with many different values. Wepresent a framework for fine-tuning LLMs using heterogeneous feedback, whichhas two main components. First, we combine the heterogeneous feedback data intoa single supervision format, compatible with methods like SFT and RLHF. Next,given this unified feedback dataset, we extract a high-quality and diversesubset to obtain performance increases potentially exceeding the full dataset.We conduct extensive experiments to understand the effectiveness of thesetechniques for incorporating heterogeneous feedback, and demonstrateimprovements from using a high-quality and diverse subset of the data. We findthat our framework is able to improve models in multiple areas simultaneously,such as in instruction following and bias reduction.</description><author>Ryan Aponte, Ryan A.

However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformerarchitecture' s struggle with handling long texts. KV-Cache has emerged as apivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of tokengeneration from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overheadproportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM communityand academia, various KV-Cache compression methods have been proposed. In thisreview, we dissect the various properties of KV-Cache and elaborate on variousmethods currently used to optimize the KV-Cache space usage of LLMs. Thesemethods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, andwe summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods.Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities oflarge language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Ourreview thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offeringinsights into future advancements in this dynamic field.</description><author>Shi Luohe, Zhang Hongyi, Yao Yao, Li Zuchao, Zhao Hai</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 12:56:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18003v1</guid></item><item><title>On Learning to Summarize with Large Language Models as References</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14239v3</link><description>Recent studies have found that summaries generated by large language models(LLMs) are favored by human annotators over the original reference summaries incommonly used summarization datasets. Therefore, we study an LLM-as-referencelearning setting for smaller text summarization models to investigate whethertheir performance can be substantially improved. To this end, we use LLMs asboth oracle summary generators for standard supervised fine-tuning and oraclesummary evaluators for efficient contrastive learning that leverages the LLMs'supervision signals. We conduct comprehensive experiments with source newsarticles and find that (1) summarization models trained under theLLM-as-reference setting achieve significant performance improvement in bothLLM and human evaluations; (2) contrastive learning outperforms standardsupervised fine-tuning under both low and high resource settings. Ourexperimental results also enable a meta-analysis of LLMs' summary evaluationcapacities under a challenging setting, showing that LLMs are not well-alignedwith human evaluators. Particularly, our expert human evaluation revealsremaining nuanced performance gaps between LLMs and our fine-tuned models,which LLMs fail to capture. Thus, we call for further studies into both thepotential and challenges of using LLMs in summarization model development.</description><author>Yixin Liu, Kejian Shi, Katherine S He, Longtian Ye, Alexander R.

Aunified and vectorized cross-domain production representation is essential. Dueto large intra-product variance and high inter-product similarity in thebroad-domain scenario, a visual-only representation is inadequate. WhileAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) text derived from the short or live-streamvideos is readily accessible, how to de-noise the excessively noisy text formultimodal representation learning is mostly untouched. We propose ASR-enhancedMultimodal Product Representation Learning (AMPere). In order to extractproduct-specific information from the raw ASR text, AMPere uses aneasy-to-implement LLM-based ASR text summarizer. The LLM-summarized text,together with visual data, is then fed into a multi-branch network to generatecompact multimodal embeddings. Extensive experiments on a large-scaletri-domain dataset verify the effectiveness of AMPere in obtaining a unifiedmultimodal product representation that clearly improves cross-domain productretrieval.</description><author>Ruixiang Zhao, Jian Jia, Yan Li, Xuehan Bai, Quan Chen, Han Li, Peng Jiang, Xirong Li</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 06:24:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02978v1</guid></item><item><title>L3iTC at the FinLLM Challenge Task: Quantization for Financial Text Classification &amp; Summarization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03033v1</link><description>This article details our participation (L3iTC) in the FinLLM Challenge Task2024, focusing on two key areas: Task 1, financial text classification, andTask 2, financial text summarization.

Effective data sampling iscrucial for RLHF, as it determines the efficiency of model training, ensuringthat models learn from the informative samples. To achieve better datageneration, we propose a new sampling method called Preference-GuidedReflective Sampling (PRS). PRS frames the response generation as anoptimization process to the explicitly specified user preference described innatural language. It employs a tree-based generation framework to enable anefficient sampling process, which guides the direction of generation throughpreference and better explores the sampling space with adaptiveself-refinement. Notably, PRS can align LLMs to diverse preferences. We studypreference-controlled text generation for instruction following andkeyword-focused document summarization.

LLMs inherently produceabstractive summaries by paraphrasing the original text, while the generationof extractive summaries - selecting specific subsets from the original text -remains largely unexplored. LLMs have a limited context window size,restricting the amount of data that can be processed at once. We tackle thischallenge by introducing LaMSUM, a novel multi-level framework designed togenerate extractive summaries from large collections of user-generated textusing LLMs. LaMSUM integrates summarization with different voting methods toachieve robust summaries. Extensive evaluation using four popular LLMs (Llama3, Mixtral, Gemini, GPT-4o) demonstrates that LaMSUM outperformsstate-of-the-art extractive summarization methods. Overall, this workrepresents one of the first attempts to achieve extractive summarization byleveraging the power of LLMs, and is likely to spark further interest withinthe research community.</description><author>Garima Chhikara, Anurag Sharma, V.

This issue is particularlypronounced in clinical dialogue summarization, a low-resource domain wheresupervised data for fine-tuning is scarce, necessitating the use of ASR modelsas black-box solutions. Employing conventional data augmentation for enhancingthe noise robustness of summarization models is not feasible either due to theunavailability of sufficient medical dialogue audio recordings andcorresponding ASR transcripts. To address this challenge, we propose MEDSAGE,an approach for generating synthetic samples for data augmentation using LargeLanguage Models (LLMs). Specifically, we leverage the in-context learningcapabilities of LLMs and instruct them to generate ASR-like errors based on afew available medical dialogue examples with audio recordings. Experimentalresults show that LLMs can effectively model ASR noise, and incorporating thisnoisy data into the training process significantly improves the robustness andaccuracy of medical dialogue summarization systems. This approach addresses thechallenges of noisy ASR outputs in critical applications, offering a robustsolution to enhance the reliability of clinical dialogue summarization.</description><author>Kuluhan Binici, Abhinav Ramesh Kashyap, Viktor Schlegel, Andy T.

Despite that, they still present significant limitations.For instance, when errors occur in the early steps of the prediction, the wholeoutput is severely affected. Such reliance on previously predicted tokens andthe inherent computational unfriendliness of sequential algorithms, motivatedresearchers to explore different architectures and methods in the search forbidirectional approaches. In this work, we introduce the BidirectionalAwareness Induction (BAI), a training method that leverages a subset ofelements in the network, the Pivots, to perform bidirectional learning withoutbreaking the autoregressive constraints. To showcase its flexibility, we applythe method to three architectures, the Transformer, ExpansionNet v2 and GPT,then perform experiments over three tasks. Experimental results showcase BAI'seffectiveness on all selected tasks and architectures. In particular, weobserved an increase of up to 2.4 CIDEr in Image-Captioning, 4.96 BLEU inNeural Machine Translation, and 1.16 ROUGE in Text Summarization compared tothe respective baselines.

In particular, malicious actors canintroduce backdoors through poisoning attacks to generate undesirable outputs.While such attacks have been extensively studied in image domains andclassification tasks, they remain underexplored for natural language generation(NLG) tasks. To address this gap, we conduct an investigation of variouspoisoning techniques targeting the LLM's fine-tuning phase via prefix-tuning, aParameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method. We assess their effectivenessacross two generative tasks: text summarization and text completion; and wealso introduce new metrics to quantify the success and stealthiness of such NLGpoisoning attacks. Through our experiments, we find that the prefix-tuninghyperparameters and trigger designs are the most crucial factors to influenceattack success and stealthiness. Moreover, we demonstrate that existing populardefenses are ineffective against our poisoning attacks. Our study presents thefirst systematic approach to understanding poisoning attacks targeting NLGtasks during fine-tuning via PEFT across a wide range of triggers and attacksettings.

However, theeffectiveness of this approach remains unclear. This study evaluates theperformance of biomedically fine-tuned LLMs against their general-purposecounterparts on a variety of clinical tasks. We evaluated their performance onclinical case challenges from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) andthe Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and on several clinicaltasks (e.g., information extraction, document summarization, and clinicalcoding). Using benchmarks specifically chosen to be likely outside thefine-tuning datasets of biomedical models, we found that biomedical LLMs mostlyperform inferior to their general-purpose counterparts, especially on tasks notfocused on medical knowledge. While larger models showed similar performance oncase tasks (e.g., OpenBioLLM-70B: 66.4% vs. Llama-3-70B-Instruct: 65% on JAMAcases), smaller biomedical models showed more pronounced underperformance(e.g., OpenBioLLM-8B: 30% vs. Llama-3-8B-Instruct: 64.3% on NEJM cases).Similar trends were observed across the CLUE (Clinical Language UnderstandingEvaluation) benchmark tasks, with general-purpose models often performingbetter on text generation, question answering, and coding tasks. Our resultssuggest that fine-tuning LLMs to biomedical data may not provide the expectedbenefits and may potentially lead to reduced performance, challengingprevailing assumptions about domain-specific adaptation of LLMs andhighlighting the need for more rigorous evaluation frameworks in healthcare AI.Alternative approaches, such as retrieval-augmented generation, may be moreeffective in enhancing the biomedical capabilities of LLMs without compromisingtheir general knowledge.</description><author>Felix J.

The thesis also investigates improvingtext-based query representations using contextualized word embeddings andspecialized attention networks. This enhances the semantic understanding ofqueries, leading to better video summaries. To emulate human-likesummarization, which accounts for both visual coherence and abstract factorslike storyline consistency, we introduce a conditional modeling approach. Thismethod uses multiple random variables and joint distributions to capture keysummarization components, resulting in more human-like and explainablesummaries. Addressing data scarcity in fully supervised learning, the thesisproposes a segment-level pseudo-labeling approach. This self-supervised methodgenerates additional data, improving model performance even with limitedhuman-labeled datasets. In summary, this research aims to enhance automaticvideo summarization by incorporating text-based queries, improving queryrepresentations, introducing conditional modeling, and addressing datascarcity, thereby creating more effective and personalized video summaries.</description><author>Jia-Hong Huang</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 02:43:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14743v1</guid></item><item><title>What Makes a Good Story and How Can We Measure It? A Comprehensive Survey of Story Evaluation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14622v1</link><description>With the development of artificial intelligence, particularly the success ofLarge Language Models (LLMs), the quantity and quality of automaticallygenerated stories have significantly increased. This has led to the need forautomatic story evaluation to assess the generative capabilities of computingsystems and analyze the quality of both automatic-generated and human-writtenstories. Evaluating a story can be more challenging than other generationevaluation tasks. While tasks like machine translation primarily focus onassessing the aspects of fluency and accuracy, story evaluation demands complexadditional measures such as overall coherence, character development,interestingness, etc. This requires a thorough review of relevant research. Inthis survey, we first summarize existing storytelling tasks, includingtext-to-text, visual-to-text, and text-to-visual. We highlight their evaluationchallenges, identify various human criteria to measure stories, and presentexisting benchmark datasets. Then, we propose a taxonomy to organize evaluationmetrics that have been developed or can be adopted for story evaluation. Wealso provide descriptions of these metrics, along with the discussion of theirmerits and limitations. Later, we discuss the human-AI collaboration for storyevaluation and generation. Finally, we suggest potential future researchdirections, extending from story evaluation to general evaluations.</description><author>Dingyi Yang, Qin Jin</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 20:35:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14622v1</guid></item><item><title>Towards Graph Prompt Learning: A Survey and Beyond</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14520v1</link><description>Large-scale "pre-train and prompt learning" paradigms have demonstratedremarkable adaptability, enabling broad applications across diverse domainssuch as question answering, image recognition, and multimodal retrieval.

While Large LanguageModels (LLMs) have been successfully applied in various NLP tasks, their rolein extractive text summarization remains underexplored. This paper introducesEYEGLAXS (Easy Yet Efficient larGe LAnguage model for eXtractiveSummarization), a framework that leverages LLMs, specifically LLAMA2-7B andChatGLM2-6B, for extractive summarization of lengthy text documents. Instead ofabstractive methods, which often suffer from issues like factual inaccuraciesand hallucinations, EYEGLAXS focuses on extractive summarization to ensurefactual and grammatical integrity. Utilizing state-of-the-art techniques suchas Flash Attention and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), EYEGLAXSaddresses the computational and resource challenges typically associated withLLMs. The system sets new performance benchmarks on well-known datasets likePubMed and ArXiv. Furthermore, we extend our research through additionalanalyses that explore the adaptability of LLMs in handling different sequencelengths and their efficiency in training on smaller datasets.

However, in real-world applications,LLMs must meet increasingly complex requirements. Beyond avoiding misleading orinappropriate content, LLMs are also expected to cater to specific user needs,such as imitating particular writing styles or generating text with poeticrichness. These varied demands have driven the development of Controllable TextGeneration (CTG) techniques, which ensure that outputs adhere to predefinedcontrol conditions--such as safety, sentiment, thematic consistency, andlinguistic style--while maintaining high standards of helpfulness, fluency, anddiversity. This paper systematically reviews the latest advancements in CTG for LLMs,offering a comprehensive definition of its core concepts and clarifying therequirements for control conditions and text quality. We categorize CTG tasksinto two primary types: content control and attribute control. The key methodsare discussed, including model retraining, fine-tuning, reinforcement learning,prompt engineering, latent space manipulation, and decoding-time intervention.We analyze each method's characteristics, advantages, and limitations,providing nuanced insights for achieving generation control. Additionally, wereview CTG evaluation methods, summarize its applications across domains, andaddress key challenges in current research, including reduced fluency andpracticality. We also propose several appeals, such as placing greater emphasison real-world applications in future research. This paper aims to offervaluable guidance to researchers and developers in the field.

Before being deployed in aspecific domain, models are often further fine-tuned on task specific data.Since human preferences are often unavailable for the last step, it isperformed using likelihood maximization as that is the typical default method.However, reinforcement learning has other advantages besides facilitatingalignment to a human derived reward function. For one, whereas likelihoodmaximization is a form of imitation learning in which the model is trained onwhat to do under ideal conditions, reinforcement learning is not limited todemonstrating actions just for optimally reached states and trains a model whatto do under a range of scenarios as it explores the policy space. In addition,it also trains a model what not to do, suppressing competitive but pooractions. This work develops a framework for last-mile fine-tuning usingreinforcement learning and tests whether it garners performance gains. Theexperiments center on abstractive summarization, but the framework is generaland broadly applicable. Use of the procedure produced significantly betterresults than likelihood maximization when comparing raw predictions. For thespecific data tested, the gap could be bridged by employing post-processing ofthe maximum likelihood outputs. Nonetheless, the framework offers a new avenuefor model optimization in situations where post-processing may be lessstraightforward or effective, and it can be extended to include more complexclasses of undesirable outputs to penalize and train against, such ashallucinations.</description><author>Alec Solway</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Aug 2024 17:49:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16753v1</guid></item><item><title>VideoLLM-MoD: Efficient Video-Language Streaming with Mixture-of-Depths Vision Computation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16730v1</link><description>A well-known dilemma in large vision-language models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaVA) isthat while increasing the number of vision tokens generally enhances visualunderstanding, it also significantly raises memory and computational costs,especially in long-term, dense video frame streaming scenarios. Althoughlearnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developedto reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeledby LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues whenaddressing user queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reducevision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens "skipping layers" ratherthan decreasing the number of vision tokens. Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, isinspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerousvision tokens in long-term or streaming video. Specifically, for eachtransformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion(e.g., 80\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer. Thisapproach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately\textasciitilde42\% time and \textasciitilde30\% memory savings for the entiretraining. Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoiddecreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performancecompared to the vanilla model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstratethe effectiveness of VideoLLM-MoD, showing its state-of-the-art results onmultiple benchmarks, including narration, forecasting, and summarization tasksin COIN, Ego4D, and Ego-Exo4D datasets.</description><author>Shiwei Wu, Joya Chen, Kevin Qinghong Lin, Qimeng Wang, Yan Gao, Qianli Xu, Tong Xu, Yao Hu, Enhong Chen, Mike Zheng Shou</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Aug 2024 17:21:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16730v1</guid></item><item><title>SurveySum: A Dataset for Summarizing Multiple Scientific Articles into a Survey Section</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16444v1</link><description>Document summarization is a task to shorten texts into concise andinformative summaries.

While previousstudies have used multimodal deep learning-based models to obtain a generalview of ECCs for volatility predicting, they often fail to capture detailed,complex information. Our research introduces a novel framework: \textbf{ECCAnalyzer}, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to extract richer, morepredictive content from ECCs to aid the model's prediction performance. We usethe pre-trained large models to extract textual and audio features from ECCsand implement a hierarchical information extraction strategy to extract morefine-grained information. This strategy first extracts paragraph-level generalinformation by summarizing the text and then extracts fine-grained focussentences using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These features are thenfused through multimodal feature fusion to perform volatility prediction.Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms traditionalanalytical benchmarks, confirming the effectiveness of advanced LLM techniquesin financial analysis.</description><author>Yupeng Cao, Zhi Chen, Qingyun Pei, Nathan Jinseok Lee, K.

Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, anotable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers theeffective training of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs).Additionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-videosummarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video contentsummarization. Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal tomultimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasksbased on the summary's modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), anda combination of video and text summarization (V2VT). However, the textualsummaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate. To address theseissues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization datasetfeaturing 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39%. Each videosummary in Instruct-V2Xum is paired with a textual summary that referencesspecific frame indexes, facilitating the generation of aligned video andtextual summaries. In addition, we propose a new video summarization frameworknamed V2Xum-LLM. V2Xum-LLM, specifically V2Xum-LLaMA in this study, is thefirst framework that unifies different video summarization tasks into one largelanguage model's (LLM) text decoder and achieves task-controllable videosummarization with temporal prompts and task instructions. Experiments showthat V2Xum-LLaMA outperforms strong baseline models on multiple videosummarization tasks.
